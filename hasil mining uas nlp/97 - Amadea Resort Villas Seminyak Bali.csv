"I chose this hotel due to convenient location, but what  I liked most about this hotel was kind staffs.  Every staffs were kind and very supportive at all times. Really enjoyed stay here a lot and hope  more people could experience hospitality of Amedea!
Especially recommending this hotel to travellers who have late hour flight. You can use the pool and also shower after you check out😀 very convenient and beneficial!"
"Just came back from 5 nights stay at Amadea. It could not have been more perfect. From the minute my family and I stepped in to the resort, our needs were taken care of. Services were impeccable and the staffs took special care of us . The restaurant, Asparagus, was top notch with the service staffs always checking on us to make sure we are taken care of. The resort is walking distance, approximately 10 minutes, to the beach and close to many amenities. Personally, this property would be IT. Highly recommended"
"The Amadea is a very peaceful & beautiful resort to stay, especially for couples, this has now been our second stay & we will definitely be going back to stay in the near future. All of the staff at the Amadea are amazing & always go above & beyond to assist you at all times.
Poolside bar is well equipped & the cocktails are fantastic. 
Buffet breakfast in Asparagus is everything you could ask for, it caters for everybody.
The valet golf carts that take you to breakfast & then back to your rooms are a added bonus.
Two good sized swimming pools with lots of sun lounges to laze around & soak up the sunshine.
We cannot wait to return & meet up with the beautiful staff once again."
"It was my wife and I first time in Bali for us. What a great resort.. Everything was great the staff, breakfast, room, facilities and location was amazing… thank you Amadea for making our trip memorable."
"We stayed in poolside interconnecting hotel rooms with teenage children and rooms had huge bathrooms and cold aircon but beds a little hard.  Hotel is lovely and well kept, great buffet breakfast with lots of options.  Pools arent huge and no swim up bar but bar is next to main swimming pool.  Hotel has separate villas within the complex and they have own pools and compounds on way into hotel.  Only thing I did not like was the long walk to front of hotel but they had golf buggys to drive you up and back to rooms.  All staff were lovely.  Hotel is right in middle of busy eat street section and a long hot walk to the beach.  Plenty of dininng close by."
"It was a perfect stay! Staff were great, kind and helpful. The location is just off the main road so it’s far enough away that it’s very quiet, they have a buggy so you don’t have to walk either. Even if you walk it’s not far, 5 minutes? 
The spa and pool was great too! The staff really take to you, know you by name and really try to make your stay wonderful!"
The stuff was very kind and helpful. Rooms and pool with other facilities super clean. We didn’t have anything to complain about
"-bed&pillow are cozy and super nice for sleeping.
- room is large with many space for our big suitcases. Bathroom is big. The shower water flow is strong.
-room is clean and updated. I like the small balcony with our small yard at the back of the room, we stay in ground  floor superior room.
-the staffs have very good service mind and welcome us everytime we leave or get back.
-the restaurant is at the front of hotel which is on the main street and the hotel where we stay is at the back ( this hotel is huge with separated zone) we need to take a shuttle car to our main hotel zone  but it was very convenient with 24 hours shuttle car.
-there’s free yoga class on Mondays and Thursdays morning at 7:30am, which is so nice
-the breakfast is very good  with variety  Both western and Indonesian, clean and super nice service. 
-location is perfect Right in the middle of the eating street of Seminyak and close to the clubs. It’s not very close to the beach but it’s easy to access"
Everything about my stay was fantastic. The location is fantastic. Right in the centre of Seminyak but the hotel part is set back from the main road so it’s mostly very quiet. The grounds are beautiful and everything looks well maintained. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful throughout my stay. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are wanting to stay in Seminyak and I would stay here again for sure.
The property is really nice and the location is very close to Seminyak Square and other good party/nightlife locations. The staff is very polite and the linen/sheets etc. was very clean. We enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend this location to anyone looking to spend time in the heart of Seminyak.
"I have nothing but good things to say about Amadea. From the very start the staff were helpful, friendly and accommodating.  While the entrance is located in the heart of seminyak eat street, the short walk into the rooms made sure that nights were quiet. Facilities like the pools were good didnt try the massage/spa but prices were comparable. Cant recommend Amadea enough, in particular the staff who were so friendly and helpful"
"Highly recommended this hotel. Amazing staff, nice pools, beautiful buffet breakfast and fantastic location, right in the heart of eat street. We stayed in a deluxe poolside room. Very spacious and clean and the pool is just 2 metres from the balcony. Very impressed and would return and recommend."
"I booked last moment and I got very good deal as well,very very good location walking distance for any club n all …room also very good and humble staff"
"Staff were friendly, welcoming and attentive. We stayed in a pool view room and then upgraded to a villa. The location was great for everything in Seminyak and the grounds were beautifully maintained. Breakfast also was excellent."
"Apart from the beautiful staff, the best part of Amadea is that the hotel itself is set back one block from the main Eat St.  So you can laze by the beautiful pool and relax in peace and quiet but then when you want to be part of the action,  it's a short walk (or 20 sec buggy ride ) to the main street where you can walk to the highlights of Seminyak.  I have stayed here 5 times and will continue to come back many times!"
"Highly recomend Amadea , room comfort , staff, location , breakfest  . wonderful stay. Thank you !"
Close to all the action and yet quiet. The staff are friendly and call you by name. They made the effort to remember everyone and puts a personal touch in a form of a note on our bed after housekeeping cleans the room. Love the private pool in front of our room. They have two and we option for the quieter side away from the main pool with the bar. They have movie nights at the pool. The massage package at the hotel is so good you don't even have to go anywhere else for a relaxing spa treatment. The international breakfast spread is so good that i ate enough to last me till dinner. I will definitely go back here again.
"We used Amadea as out isolation hotel as we were the 1st people to return to Bali after 2 years 
The hotel is wonderfully clean, a beautiful pool, fantastic breakfast included and happy, helpful staff.
Although I have my own villa, we will use Amadea for our  needs to come to Seminyak . Great place"
Great resort with fantastic staff. Highly recommend for groups looking for a central place to stay snd celebrate s special ocassion.
The staff were friendly. There was a daily personal message left on the bed by housekeeping to welcome you back and that was very nice. The room with pool access was the winning point with my children.
"The location here is fantastic if you are looking to travel by foot.
I recommend this place for travelers looking for super convenience to night life and shops.
It is also very quiet as it is not by the road side.
The staff were amazing, they were obviously professionally trained.
You can probably find a more beautiful accommodation, but its location would not be as great as this one."
"Centrally located, on the busiest street but calm and noise free. Rooms are compact and well equipped. Breakfast doesn’t have much vegetarian option. Front desk very efficient and helping.over all a great stay.
Would recommend to others."
"Everything was perfect . The hotel is in a strategic place and at the heart of Seminyak . Good breakfast, nice staff and excellent service.
I strongly recommend this hotel."
"It is the best of Balinese culture meet clean, efficient and super friendly and respectful staff."
Just don’t book thru Agoda as they caused me so much stress by not communicating with the hotel or myself over a discrepancy in room.  The hotel had an inferior room booked under my name but my Agoda booking was for a deluxe room. I nearly didbt get the room I’ve booked & payed for. Lucky the hotel was kind enough to fix it
"Credit to everyone at Amadea, always greeted with a smile and acknowledgement and great attention to any enquiries. Great location, close to all shops, amenities etc and room set back away from any noises."
"Everything there is just perfect! Room is clean, bed is comfortable, and people there! I went to the other hotel at the same area that was half of the price for another night and i was so regretted. I rather top up for this hotel!"
Every morning the staff ask how you are..is everything ok..what a way to start your day..with the help of Yuni l was able to change my booking by 1 day without charge...when Agoda did not reply to emails for over 3 days..then claimed credit for date change..thank you Yuni..Amadea Reservations
"The staff are beyond kind, helpful and bubbly :) very pleasant. The hotel is very clean and has what you need. The pool is perfect. Location is a bit farther from the beach than I thought, but still so close - when I have the energy to walk! Very handily set back from the main road, providing great access to small shops and restaurants etc"
"good place, good location, friendly staffs. room is nice. Only thing is that there was a stale smell when we first entered. The pool is really nice. Breakfast is buffet and nice as well. will recommend to stay"
everyone in the hotel is so friendly! and they serve really good pancake during breakfast haha
"The best location. Right near restaurants and shops. Very nice staff and facilities. Coffee shop down the alley called how I met coffee, very good!"
"Great location, facilities, yoga ,spa and warm and kind staff.
Amazing atmosphere and fantastic vibes around. 
Nothing to complain. Highly recommended."
"Worth every single cent, great service, pool, room, location! Will come back again! :)"
"2nd time here. I love the place, the room is big and cozy. The pool is great. The staff are very good: friendly, helpful and always smile! The location is strategic. My fave hotel in Seminyak."
"Above all, thank you for your kindness and supporting attitude. I’ve got a lot of positiveness to Indonesia. Strongly recommended."
"Rooms very well-priced and decent. Friendly staff, buggy service that runs 24h. We arrived at 10am and were obliged with an early check-in :) Breakfast was included in the room rate and although variety was not extensive, we really enjoyed the eggs benedict and the dragonfruit smoothie bowl. 100% would recommend, please support this hotel; they are still trying their best to ramp up on bookings no thanks to the pandemic. Service was very genuine and homely, will definitely stay here again next time."
Teh Restauran service for breakfast is the best
"Fantastic, staff very helpful always friendly and respectful. Accomodation spotless and  tasteful . Will come again"
The staff are just the best. 4 star resort with 5 star service.
Loved our stay here . My 14th stay
"Loved staying at the Amadea. It is a great central location just off eat street,beautiful and clean hotel and very friendly staff.. will definitely stay again.. maybe in one of their villas."
"stayed here a few times and never disappointed me:
* big rooms with a nice big bathroom
*the rooms are quiet, good sleep
* cleaning is really good for Bali standards
*staff is really friendly
*breakfast was incl. this time and was really good(enough options)"
"Great value with a fantastic breakfast that we loved each morning. Staff were incredibly friendly across all departments and nothing was too much trouble.  Hotel positioned well back from the main road so was nice and quiet to sleep, and still close to walk to all the restaurants that Seminyak offers."
"The resort is well placed and has everything you would want. Above all, the staff are fantastic"
"Clean, very friendly staffs, good food, good location, nice decoration and facilities (there is outdoor theatre on weekend) 😊"
"We upgraded at the resort itself upon check in. It was a great stay, we even extended night. Staff were amazing, room service and breakfast were great too. Room was spacious and clean. The only troublesome thing is that the main entrance and the resort rooms were a little far but makes for a good walk after meals. We even booked our bikes from the hotel, truly convenient. Highly recommended."
"Do yourself a favour and book here. Great location, great staff, lovely pool."
"Had a lovely time - the room was super comfortable, the staff genuinely friendly. I loved the pool and pool area.  The only negative was the breakfast - terrible coffee, tiny fruit plate and orange squash 🙁 instead of juice - not really worthy of a 4 star hotel"
Third time staying here. Great pool. Amazing location. Staff are super friendly.
"It's my 2nd stay with Amadea, located in the heart of Seminyak's busiest district makes travelling to most places of interest and great restaurants a short journey. The amenities are not fantastic (with only 1 pool) but looking at how much the other resorts/hotels in the same location would cost (almost double), I have absolutely no complaints. (I mean tbh when's the last time you spent time in a hotel gym/pool during vacation.)
Staffs here are a big plus point, they are extremely friendly and helpful; most of them speak basic English. Definitely coming back if I ever visit Seminyak again! :)"
"Everyone was surprisingly kind. They initially guided us to a room different from the reservation, but immediately recognized their mistake and guided us again. Very kindly. Room service is also excellent. Even if it is corona, this is the perfect travel destination."
Perfect location near popular clubs. Spacious room. Had a wonderful time here.
Location is so good and people who working in this hotel are all nice and very kind. For the price also great.
Location is good. We didn’t get the villa but it’s nice and cozy. Staff is very nice and friendly. Highly recommended.
"The staff at the resort are very helpful. Thank you to Ankey, Yogi, Next, Julia and all the others. They helped make our trip very memorable."
We stayed for 4 nights. We enjoyed our stay mostly. The courtyard is lovely and the swimming pool is very nice. The resort is off the busy street so it's very quiet. The staff is fantastic. The breakfast has a wide selection. The only problem we had was the shower drain was very slowly and show walls had a lot of mildew at the bottom.
"The only cons is there is timing for hot water started at about 7/8 am till 10 pm. Other than that all are great, very value for money for that big villa with a pool and the staffs are also very helpful."
Room is basic but was close to the main fun area without any of the accompanying street noise due to it being within the complex and far from the street.
Stayed for 4 nights. Very well located place for shops and restaurants. Staff were super lovely. Can’t do enough for you. Room was good although bed very hard. Enjoyed our stay but preferred Sanur and Ubud. Seminyak a little too commercial for us
Clean room nice pool although a lot of shade friendly lovely helpful staff nice breakfast set back from busy street so nice and quiet
"Used their villas,  with  private  pool, great deal, exceptionally  spacious;  walk or short drive  to  foods and fun  locations. Meal deliveries  smooth. We had We had 10  for  dinner at our  villa."
GREAT LOCATION & VALUE FOR MONEY
"10 mins walk to Ku De Ta
5 mins walk to La Favela"
"Great location and quiet
Big rooms with all amenities available 
42 inch tv with plenty channels 
Really helpful staff
Breakfast is good, but need to walk to the front"
"Big clean rooms fully equipped, bed was comfortable, great location in the heart of Seminyak plenty of restaurants bars, great breakfast and staff were helpful and friendly"
"Good value, set back off noisy, bustling street. Haven right  in the centre of ‘eat’ street. Pool area in lovely garden and staff extremely friendly and helpful!"
"I know the hotel for long time but this hotel well maintain specially for cleanless. I like to stay in this hotel because very clean, big room, the staff very friendly & helpfull."
Great ambience. Wonderful staff. Gorgeous grounds. Excellent location
"Had a pool access room 135 need a bit more shade for the lounges , beds are comfortable shower is good , and the staff are very helpful to your needs . Close to many restaurants. Far enough back from the busy street quiet at night ."
Need to walk to the main street but they provide golf carts. Very good breakfast. Cooperative staff. Clean eoom. Centrally located.
Place is great!
"Really enjoyed our stay, nice quiet hotel located so close to everything Seminyak offers. Perfect service and nothing ever too much of a hassle. The breakfast each morning had wonderful selections and the pool bar was also our favourite, very reasonably priced. We’ll be back!"
Terbaikksss
Friendly amazing staff.  Always polite and helpful.  Breakfast times were great. Buffet open till 10 and then sit down till 11am. Great if your not early riser.  Good choice for buffet
"This was a super hotel, great location just of the main street, but very quiet indeed. Staff were wonderful. It would be great if they had a gym so we can exercise during the daytime heat."
"If there is one improvement I can suggest, it is to have ""toppers"" on the beds. the beds are just way to hard. The service, staff, facilities and location are fabulous, loved the pool,
Cheers,"
enough clean room and warm welcome stuffs!
The room smelt dusty on arrival. The bar is average but otherwise a great place to stay!
Best place to stay in seminyak
Quite a walk to the beach but who needs the beach when you have 2 superb pools in the resort where you can relax and have peace and quiet.
Always great
"Awesome location, polite and friendly staff. Good service and clean rooms."
"Not a bad hotel, good location, and staff are amazing, very helpful"
"Repeat travelers to the Amadea, great place to relax. Staff very attentive and always smiling. Breakfast is somewhat of a let down and needs to improve, hopefully the pool bar will be reopened next time we visit."
Hotel is well located near plenty of eating spots.  Rooms are clean and tidy and grounds are well kept.  Breakfast is nice.  Staff are friendly and helpful.
"The friendly staff is impressive. Cleanliness is pricey. Location is good. Breakfast restaurant was satisfactory. The poolside is comfortable and I would stay there again. Overall, I felt it was overpriced. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is thinking of a luxury hotel."
Short walking distance to Seminyak Square and Seminyak Village. Staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. Given free 15 minutes massage and welcome drinks. Quiet and nice as it's facing away from the street. Will definitely go back and book a different room category with the 20% discount for return guests.
Great location
good location to Eat street - good breakfast options - basic clean rooms - good value
"Firstly, the entire linen and bathroom towels need to be renewed, the current towels are grey at best. 
Secondly,  Room service from the restaurant, the food always arrives Luke warm due to distance carried. Maybe heat satchels would help? 
Longer pool bar hours could be considered? 
Finally the entire staff are forever smiling and only to willing to help make your holidays a lot happier."
"I made a reservation for 1 night in their superior room, surprisingly they still have available villa then we decided to take the villa instead the room because there are 4 of us. Villa was great, they have private pool, 2 giant bedrooms and bathrooms, big space for living room and dining room. Staff was great too and very helpful."
Apart from the very friendly and helpful staffs..room for superior and deluxe is very average..u can get a better modern one for the price paid
Kamar bersih dan staff ramah
"Beautiful and friendly resort situated in the heart of eat street Seminyak.
The hotel is set away from the hussel and hussel of busy Seminyak yet you step out and it's right there.
Rooms were clean staff friendly ."
"Location is ok but too old hotel paid 100 dollars per night? !!!  Staffs are so friendly. Stayed pool view first floor , too noisy even we could hear one guy called 5am right next door and upstairs pounding ."
The resort would not offer a credit for being unable to stay here due to corona virus. Therefore I would not stay here in the future as they just took the money knowing people could not travel
"we arrived just after midnight and often you may find some hotels with no one around but at amadea we were greeted and taken down in the buggy to the reception area as soon as we arrived with a very warm welcome. for this night we had a deluxe pool terrace room which was extremely well kept and clean (although you would hope so for a brand new hotel). the facilities are very nice but i must say the main benefit of this hotel is most certainly the staff. having stayed in many hotels in bali this has been the only one that has been simply above and beyond always ensuring that we were satisfied and anything we ordered was delivered. for the future nights after the first one we stayed in a 2 bedroom villa which i must say is breathtaking and really something unexpected for bali. as they take pride in the cleanliness and ensuring it is to the highest standard the daily housekeeping does take some time so try and stay out for a few hours once you leave as they clean the massive villa, the pool and even do some gardening. for those interested facilities in the villa includes 2 separate buildings. one that opens up to the pool has a bedroom (with large lcd tv) with large bathroom that even has the shower connecting with the far side of the pool. the other has the living room (large lcd tv), dining table and kitchen on the lower level. the kitchen includes plenty of glasses and crockery with hot stove, microwave, kitchen knife set, large fridge and even a water filter that would find in offices with plenty of drinking water so you are never going to run out. upstairs in that building is a study area with lcd tv and sofa bed with another bedroom connecting to a balcony and also another bathroom with massive shower. both bathrooms have dual sinks. the pool has 2 sunbeds and is your own private pool. this hotel is the place to be in seminyak! it is amazing in all areas and easy to access everything seminyak and bali has to offer."
"We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights at Amadea Resort & Villas Seminyak Bali. The Resort is about a year old and looks quite new. The deluxe room that we stayed is quite large about 34 sqm and has a large bathroom. However, there is no door between the wardrobe compartment and the bathroom. The kingsize bed is quite comfortable. What we like most about the resort is the excellent service provided by all the staff. The are friendly, polite and cheerful. The buffet breakfast provided by the resort is mediocre. Almost the same menu everyday! They should change the menu and have a variety everyday."
"Amadea Resort & Villas Seminyak Bali is located in the midst of one of Seminyak's main restaurant areas.  Yet, it is set back from the main road to ensure a tranquil environment for its guests.  Staff are helpful to a tee and everyone greets you a smiles no matter how often they see you during the day.  A particular plus was that I had a late night flight and could make use of shower facilities again even after I checked out.  This was a real highlight.  I definitely recommend the resort to travellers looking for a straightforward and enjoyable stay."
"Have chosen Amadea Resort and Villas for our Christmas getaway because it was great value and in Seminyak which was close to everywhere we wanted to get to. Arrived late at night but our driver sent from the hotel waited for us, despite the awful flight delay. To our surprise, he spoke perfect English which was a plus as we had some questions and he was able to answer us promptly. Arrived at the hotel 30 minutes later from the airport. Fresh! Because the service was so prompt and friendly. 

Stayed for a total of 3 nights and we must say ""WoW!"" The stay was awesome. Upon arrival, we were given vouchers for breakfast, welcome drinks, massage, and free Internet in the lobby. Our room was a superior type one as we travelled as a couple of friends. Small getaway. 

When we were guided to our room, the staff member explained everything to us. From safe, to the TV channels to the amenities. Super. We even had a balcony and can laze outside looking at the nice view. They even installed an iPod/iPhone dock at the bedside table which was very convenient.

Bed was clean and comfy. Easily recharged and ready for action the next day. Hotel was able to arrange for full day transport at a good price too so if you want a driver, do not hesitate to look for it at the hotel. Decreases your hassle to research online and get a cheaper and bigger/cleaner hotel transport. 

Bottled drinking water is complimentary.

Last but not least, I would want to commend them for the effort they took to bring my passport to me. They went out of their way to make sure I get on my flight on time. They sent a letter the night before reminding guests to have International Departure Tax ready and to check the safe. Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of forgetting my passport and left it in the safe. I was already at the airport when I realised that my passport was not with me. Made a call to them and they sent their staff with my passport to the airport in the rain at no cost."
"We have stayed in Amadea Resort in Seminyak for 2 nights only, from 2-4 January 2016. I wish my holiday would much longer. The Location of this Amadea are terrific, it's in the middle of shops, restaurants, etc. Just walk. We have booked superior room with pool access,on the ground floor. The The room are spacious, with bathtub & shower and walking wardrobe, a spacious bathroom. The Air Condition are very cool, very good, while bali is very hot. That is really a plus. And, guess what, i have found a bible in the drawer. It is really a plus. We love this Resort, and would back again for sure if we go back to Bali again. Bravo, Amadea. Thank you for you to make our holiday worthwhile, and thank you for all the staff who are really friendly, specially Agus, and Beny who made us duck from towel. Great job :)"
"Stayed for 5 nights at Amadea and couldn't recommend the resort more highly. Situated in the perfect location on ""east street"", 5 min walk from Seminyak Square and 10-15 mins to Ku De Ta and the main beach. The street is thriving with places to eat of a night and a couple of bars within walking distance.
The resort itself was fantastic, the staff couldn't be more friendlier. There were a mixture of people staying at the resort, ranging from friends travelling (such as us), families, couples and bigger groups. We stayed in a twin share pool deluxe room which was all we required and it was located right next to the pool and bar, which was very useful during $5 happy hour for cocktails!
Restaurant at the front of resort provided a great buffet breakfast every morning and the dinner menu was also great, lots of walk up customers from the street ate as well.
Would highly recommend Amadea to anyone as it covers everything you need for a relaxing stay in Bali"
"we thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at the amadea resort & villas in seminyak. the staff were very helpful with all our requests, going out of their way to find suitable tours and activities for us.. the resort is located in the main street of seminyak, with restaurants and good quality shops available on both sides. the pool was very relaxing and large enough to cater for demand. the rooms were not overly large, but they were well appointed and included all the necessities. we all made good use of the spa facilities,which were very affordable. would definitely recommend it and would stay there again."
"The housekeepers gave us a surprise (in a good way) everyday which i don't want to spoil it for you. The villas and rooms are very well maintained, my partner and I stayed at the room, if we get a chance next time, we will definitely look into the villas as they come with their own private pool. 
The place is cleaned, the comfort of the bed is comparable to the top quality 5 star hotels.
Taxi to the hotel from airport will cost you around 100k rupiah in no traffic but prepare to pay up to 150k rupiah, so don't get tricked into paying more.
There are a number of restaurants nearby and a number of boutique shops, so the ladies will enjoy staying there. I was more into local street food so there are limited shops who will offer those. The walk to Seminyak beach is approximately 15min walk. Look out for promotions and you can easily score it for around AUD$95 per night inc.
There are a number of spas and massages around the hotel, there is good quality one around the corner called Nirvana Spa. Last words, Amadea is not like your ordinary hotel, it's more like a village /resort. I will definitely recommend anyone who likes to stay at Seminyak."
"My husband I stayed at Amadea Resort and Villas for 2 nights from 4/20/2012 to 4/22/2012. 
The resort is located near to all the best restaurants in Seminyak which makes easy access to dining, massage and shopping!!! The service was good in overall. The breakfast was fresh and the waiter was very friendly. Amadea Resort and Villas is a small-cozy resort if you are looking for an affordable stay at Seminyak. The room was clean and the swimming pool was small but cozy."
"in bali we stayed at ayana resorts (much more expensive for a similar room), a villa complex in canggu, a small villa in seminyak and here at amadea.  the service at amadea was equal to if not better than ayana.  and although the environment is no match for ayana, it was still very comfortable with good facilities and food.

we would easily choose to stay here again, and would recommend amadea to people."
"I could not say no to Amadea Resort and Villas Seminyak! The staff is so helpful and nice! It’s a quiet place which you won’t  get disturb during your stay. The cleanliness is good, they surprised me with birthday cake and special arrangement on room service during my stay. It’s so lovely of the. I would definitely come back!! Thanks Amadea Resort and Villas Seminyak for your effort and arrangement!"
"We found the Amadea location perfect for our needs.  It gave us quick access to the main road through Seminyak but a quiet, self contained, private place to get away from everything, when we just wanted to chill on our own.  The pool was beautiful and the kids were quite happy to return to the Villa after battling the heat and Bali traffic.

Room service was excellent.  There were a team of around 4 cleaners come trough each day.  So even if you were at the Villa, it wasn't long before they'd been and gone.  Just ask them to close the upstairs door between the bedroom and bathroom when they come in to turn down the sheets.  We had a few mozzies as the door was left ajar.  Easy fixed.

We were lucky enough to get Villa 1 ""Bayu""which is close to the front and and not far to walk to from the entrance.  Despite been close to the Conceirge and car area, we felt very secluded and never had any noise issues.

Breakfast was OK.  Nothing special, but OK. Its probably their weakest point for us.  Sausages were always dry and the Jams were the jelly style (no fruit). The breakfast seemed to lack a bit of ""love"". Seemed a bit lacking in quality.  Variety was OK, just could have been better.

I wouldn't let the breakfast weigh too much in your decisions, its a great place and central and the service was top notch."
"My wife and I had the best time in Seminyak and loved our stay at the Amadea Resort. Right from the start with the driver who picked us up to the amazing animals made out of the room towels by the cleaning staff, everything was amazing. The staff were so friendly and the location was brilliant. The Amadea is quiet, the rooms are perfect and it is conveniently located within walking distance of everything that Seminyak has to offer. We will certainly be staying there next time we visit Bali, which hopefully will be soon!"
"With just two days in Seminyak, we decided to choose a hotel that was right in the centre of the shopping and eating district. The location of the Amadea is perfect for this as it is on Jalan Laksmana, (also known as eat street). It has a selection of villas and rooms and two pools. There is a spa on site (we didn't get time to use it) but no gym. 
If you choose a deluxe pool terrace, ask for the one facing the smaller pool for a bit more peace and quiet. The hotel is still pretty new (we were told two years) and the clean, functional rooms are testament to this.  
The standout however are the helpful staff who were terrific from the check-in counter to the concierge to the security man on the street who was great in helping us across the street and flagging down taxis. (Bluebird taxis are the best and will always run the meter).
The rooms are set well back from the street and some people have commented that it is a bit of a walk. If you are really that challenged (or if you have very small children), they offer a buggy service to ferry you to the front desk. We timed the walk a few times and we were lucky if it was a minute. Remember that you are in the heart of Seminyak so being back from the street is a good thing!
Food is ok but if I were to stay again I would't include breakfast given all the great eating spots nearby. This is a good value hotel especially compared to other properties in Seminyak.
Other Tips
The small bar fridge is empty, perfect to store your own drinks
Ask for a map of the area from reception
There are two computer terminals in lobby with free and fast wifi (Wifi available in the room but there is a small charge)
If you are Australian and are dying for a good coffee, go to Sea Circus
For fresh salads go to Zuchinni Cafe (on Laksmana, walking distance from Amadea)"
"we stayed at amadea for 3 nights in mid august at the end of a 19 day bali holiday. our room was new, fresh and clean, had a dvd player and a nice little balcony overlooking the main pool. the resort, although centrally located on busy ""eat st"", is found at the end of a lovely tree-lined driveway, making it very peaceful and quiet. the location of the resort is great for shopping and eating out, and the beach is only a 10 minute walk away (or a very, very cheap cab ride away, if your feet are sore from shopping). we would definitely stay at amadea when we next visit seminyak, providing the room rates don't increase."
"Amadea is where I spent my holiday. “Holiday” is derived from the idea of “Holy Day”. Monkeys live in Bali, and like all things Balinese, Monkeys are holy. Temples are also Holy. Monkeys & Temples…They go together like pepper and salt. Like chocolate and malt. Like a Chris Brown assault (even though it was Rhianna’s fault). 

The life of a monkey might also be thought of as a holiday. Imagine… bananas and playful shenanigans, these are the aspirations of the holy monkey. Or should I say, “holiday monkey”? But there are serious matters to consider, monkeys live in holy temples. Or should I say ""Holiday Temples”. Many tourists holiday at these temples. Monkeys often frown upon foreign holiday trespassers. Trespassers with no understanding of holy monkey civilization. Civilization founded by Monkeys? Temples built by holy monkeys? It seems unlikely, but in this mystic land of Bintang and nasi goreng many things are beyond the understanding of our ignorant western ways. Our own lives must be judged first!

Amadea is a beautiful resort. When I arrived they showed us our room on the second floor. We walked up some stairs to the door. We opened the door, got on the floor. Everybody did the dinosaur! In conclusion, Bali is a land of exotic mystery and intrigue."
"Amadea Resort and Villas is absolutely amazing!! I cannot fault one thing about this place.  The location (right in the middle of eat street, but set back from the road so no noise), the staff (cannot do enough for you and always with a smile of their faces), the rooms (lovely modern clean rooms.  Especially love the deluxe pool terrace rooms facing the smaller quiet pool) and the food (wonderful buffet breakfast served in restaurant on Eat Street and fantastic room service.  Pool Bar is also a bonus!!)  This is my second time staying here and I will definately be back.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Seminyak.  This is it!!"
"Strategically located on Laksmana Street, Amadea was a stone's throw away from trendy eateries such as Ultimo, Cafe Bali, Rumours, CHANDI and The Junction. Due to the good location, it was also very easy to get a taxi in front of the hotel. Service was excellent and they attended to our every whim with a smile and gesture that exceeded our expectations. Our room was very clean and reasonably priced, on top of that we also enjoyed the very spacious bathroom! Will definitely recommend Amadea to friends and other travelers looking to explore Seminyak."
"We stayed at several places in Bali, and though the staff at all places were really friendly, Amadea's staff were really really amazing!! 
Subtle touches like a handwritten note left in our room to wish us a happy new year, and coming back to find all our clothes neatly folded and organised in our room after heading out for a day - I have never had such a good service in a hotel of this price. 
Aside from the staff, everything else about this hotel is also fab, especially since I think we paid quite a reasonable price for the quality we got. We were upgraded to a Deluxe pool view room and it was just awesome. The little pull-out clothes line in the shower was also a welcome luxury for hanging up wet togs and other bits and bobs.
If we come back to Seminyak we will most definitely be staying at Amadea!"
"amadea, as promises, is a beautiful modern hotel located @ the heart of seminyak, bali.. it has a big room, lovely terrace, clean swimming pool, and best of all helpful & very hospital stafff!! we've stayed for 4 days, and my doughter was crying when we has to check out...
it has met all of our expectations. we eat well @ seminyak, relax our soul & complete our love.. thank u bali, thx amadea..."
"our 6 day trip at the amadea was just what we needed. we had both been to bali before, but never stayed in seminyak. amadea is in a fantastic location. although we'd been recommended restaurants in seminyak that were out of 'eat street', it was so cheap in a taxi that we'd still consider staying there again.
the only 'cons' were that the air-con was really noisy however it probably helped due to our loud neighbours. no hotel could help this however but try and get a room beside the pool with no joining rooms."
I always stay here every time i come to bali. The staffs are really nice and friendly.
"This is my 11th stay at this resort and will keep coming back. Great location on Eat St in Seminyak. Lovely, clean and staff are very friendly."
