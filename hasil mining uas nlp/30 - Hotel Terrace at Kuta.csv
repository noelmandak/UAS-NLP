"I originally booked one week and extended to two because I loved this property so much.  The location is excellent (close to restaurants, massage, shopping & the beach), the staff are super friendly, there’s a beautiful central pool and the rooms are comfortable and seem bigger than they are due to the high ceilings and windows. The bed is also super comfortable and for the price, this is excellent value!  The breakfast, although not fancy, had everything I could possible eat… eggs your way, toast, cereal, juice, Asian hot selection, pastries and fruit. 
My only issue was minor, the shower drainage wasn’t good, neither was the water pressure or temperature but honestly it didn’t bother me because everything else was so enjoyable. Splurge and take a pool access room!
I think this is an excellent option if you want a smaller boutique property in the thick of things but feel like you are far removed from the hustle and bustle."
"The room was very clean and cozy. I had really good night sleeps while I was staying there! Nice swimming pool also! For the price I paid, the stay was worth every penny and even more!"
"Toilet, bedsheets and towels were clean. Bathroom and shower was spacious. The price was definitely value-for-money given that I had direct access to the pool from my room. The hotel welcomes you to use Gojek or other ride-hailing apps so the location is not a problem. The hotel is also close to Legian street where many dining options are available. TV was a little small and had no world cup channel but no complaints given the price I paid for."
"The hotel is just a few minutes walk to Kuta beach! surrounded by many resto and mini mart, suitable for those who love going to the beach and snackings :))
I like the service, the staff is always there to help you with anything. my room is always clean. Definitely would comeback here again if I'm in Kuta."
"This hotel is in an strategic places. We can find some shops around. The room and bathroom were clean and so comfortable. The facilities were great. The pool view was the most interesting one. Anyway, during my trip İ got problem with my clothes, and amazingly this hotel provided me with sewing kit! Superb!. I only dialed the phone and the staff was so helpful. I can't say more, we were just amazed with this hotel though the price is low. İf i visit Bali again, i absolutely will stay here"
Good location. 5 minutes walk to the beach and you can grab food and drinks on the way easily! The room is big enough for me and very clean. Nice and helpful staff!
"I booked this hotel several times since it was one of the few hotels where I felt at home. The staff is kind, and the pool is clean. I will be back. Thank you"
"Centrally located within walking distance to massage parlors, restaurants and shopping. Very clean rooms and staff was very helpful, welcoming and friendly"
"I stay at this hotel every time I come to Bali. Great location, great hotel and great staff."
"It’s modern, clean, comfortable, blackout curtains, hot showers. I’ve stayed here at 250/night a few times. There’s nothing like this at this price point, except maybe a couple others. If you value comfort over room size than this is the place."
"Located at a strategic location within Kuta, the hotel is just simple and nice. The staff is helpful with my questions. Value for money."
"Clean room, friendly staff, great facilities and great access to legian and kuta beach with a very affordable price."
"Very nice located hotel with good internet, well sized TV (older model so not smart) and spacious rooms! The pool is small, but big enough for a group.
There are just two let downs. The shower pressure is poor, they can upgrade that. There are also just two sockets for electricity in the bedroom, which are not very smart located."
"I like it here 😃 a lot!
The staff was friendly and helped w making copies of my passport and brought extra water and towels when requested.
They were so quick to fulfill all my needs. The room was really clean and the bed is amazing! The pillows were soft and comfy.
The beach is about an 8 min walk w cool shops and eateries along the way.
5 stars w a 3 star ✨ price!
Kevin O."
There is comfortable and clean. Staff are  welcome and be generous. next time i'll be stay there again
"Staffs were kind, rooms are nice and clean. Great location for solo travelers."
It was good and clean:)
"We booked Terrace At Kuta for our transit before heading to Ubud. Booked room with pool access and it was so awesome. The pool is clean, the bed is clean. Suitable for transit and the room is suitable for couple, if you are with family have to book bigger size room or connecting room."
"I was here back in 2016, i was happy then an i am happy now. The hotel is well maintained even through the pandemic. Its walking distance to kuta beach and legian. A quiet hotel on a busy area"
"It’s definitely a steal for the hotel price. 
Location wise is great, 10-15 mins walk to kuta beach, 30 mins away to airport. 
Outside the hotel, there’s plenty of stalls for souvenir shopping, massage parlours, food and beverages to choose from. 
The staffs were helpful 👍🏻
I enjoyed my stay definitely. 
A note for light sleeper: the pubs near by have live bands at night, and could be very loud at night, you could request for a room at the other end, which might help. Else, for me, not a problem after a whole day out and about."
"Satisfied with the hotel's cleanness, kind staffs. Close to Kuta beach and major road. Considering the price, so much satisfactory"
"+ well located, easy to reach resto, minimart, beach, etc. 
+ friendly staff
+ nice interior
+ value for money
- floor need to clean better
- we could still hear the sound from nearby club, but it’s ok we could still sleep well"
"Great location w so many facilities surroundings(shops, restaurants, bars). Its peaceful tho in the middle of nightlife happenings in Kuta/Legian street. The staffs was great and helpful. They even welcomed us with a drinks. Room was comfy enough w pool access. Extended our hours here bcs our flights was at night. Overall, such a pleasant stay and will stay here again."
"I've stayed at this place four times now and I'm still satisfied. Its just a great comfy affordable to go to place to stay. Location is great, walkable distance to the beach and many restaurants near by. Not much facilities but hey in Bali, you tend to spend more time somewhere else anyway so it's fine. One particular night some room near mine was blasting music at 4am in the morning & I called the receptionist to help assist in the matter and they did. Much appreciated! Overall, easiest choice for accommodation every time I visit Bali & choose to stay in Kuta."
"I had stayed in Bali 7days,   arriving day for 1 day, and 2days in Ubud, and rest of days was here in this Terrace hotel!  awesome!  the staff was super friendly and very supportive!!  room was great! the bed was the puls point!   go try! definitely i will back again !  thanks to all staff at reception desk"
"Very lovely boutique hotel. Spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, strong wi fi, efficient a/c, nice swim pool, really good breakfast & very friendly & lovely staff.  Very highly recommended 🏝 ..."
Best place to try in kuta have everything near by and especially the staff is great
"Our stay at Hotel Terrace was very relaxing. It's a good location in the city because we are walking distance from all the good places. 
Our room has direct access to the pool, which is a plus!"
the price was so worth it with the facilities also the service was great and their staff so friendly and helpfull! definitely will come back here soon!
"Highly recommend, the staff was very attentive to our needs. Will come back again next time we're in Kuta."
"If you prefer someone at busy street. Walking distance to beach and all restaurants,bar and clubbing.
Choose this place. 
I got what i paid."
"Great location, lots of amenities around. 5 mins walk to the beach. Clean room, nice breakfast, friendly staff, love to come back"
"We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Terrace Kuta. The staff were very nice, amenities were good and location was good if you’re looking to be in the city in Kuta.
The A/C unit was not working well and had a large leak that resulted in some of our stuff getting wet, however we asked for help with it and the staff repaired it quickly with a smile.
Overall I would recommend this stay to those looking for an inner city stay at a good price point. 
The one suggestion I would have is it could have been cleaner but, still not bad by any means.
Thank you to the staff who made our stay so enjoyable!"
Hotel is quite far from the beach. Room is lovely and clean.  Highly recommended.
"We had a very pleasant stay in Terace at Kuta! Rooms were modern, clean and quiet, the pool interestingly designed, the breakfast adequate. Overall great value for money!"
Enjoyed the stay ! Recommended
The location is great. Room is clean.
"i've been stay at terrace for several times. staffs are nice and greeting me always.
breakfast is simple and good and pool are very clean all the time."
"The room is clean and bed is comfortable enough. Good location, near from the Kuta beach and good restaurants and bars."
"very quite and good and affordable price.
recommand to you if you travel kuta or legian area."
"Will come back again, on our next trip"
I booked room connected with the swimming pool. My son really loved it. All the staff really helpful and very nice
"No cons. Great price, staff, pool. Only 10 minute walk to the beach, Legian Street and tons of restaurants. Quiet at night and offer a reasonable late, late check out. Breakfast buffet is great and definitely worth the extra money when you book it."
That was really good accomodation
That was really good accomodation
One of the best hotel to stay in Kuta
Good price and the most nicest one is the bed!!! Super comfy!
"IT WAS AMAZING EXP.
THEY ARE SUPER FRIENDLY AND KIND INFRONT OF LOBBY.
AND HUGH POOL CENTER OF HOTEL HAVING FUN WITH IT.
I RECOMMEND TWICE AND MORE"
"The Hotel is on a busy street which is near bars, restaurants, and grocery stores,... You can find anything near this hotel. 
The hotel's facilities, location, and decoration are beyond my expectations. 
Very worth staying here!"
"Terrace at Kuta Hotel is situated 15 minutes away (if you walk) from the Kuta beach and 5-10 minutes away from Legian Street (if you walk), which is where all the happening night life takes places. The hotel is clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very yummy. Their staff is very welcoming and attentive. Would definitely come back to Terrace at Kuta Hotel again 😊👍🏼"
"The towels are a bit old, perhaps more toiletries are needed!"
"The pool is too noisy and the breakfast need improve, other thing is ok"
Everything good
Was having a great stay here
"Nice staff, cleaned hotel"
Room is very clean. All Staff very helpfull n nice. Walking 10minute to beachwalk n kuta beach..
Enjoy my time here
Rooms were clean & swimming pool were pretty decent
"Staff and room all satisfied my stay.
I liked here and will stay here again"
"Had lovely staff willing to help you out.
A small pool with a few sunbeds.
I liked here"
Centre of Kuta. Easy to walk and search for food. Recommended 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Clean hotel with friendly staff.
"Very clean, very comfortable. Good breakfast."
"Good hotel on prime area, rooms are small, breakfast is okey, nearby Indian restaurant, helping staff."
Great place
"Pros- clean, price , location, staff
Cons- weak wifi, fridge not very cold"
"Strategic location although not in the main road. Located in the narrow road within 50 meters come the Legian main road.
Love the room that have access to the pool. Amenities are minimum only soap and shampoo. If needed toothbrush then you can call them. But dont worry next to hotel is small supermarket. Room is large. The light tend to dim. The down side is water that not run so well. Others are so good."
The hotel is cheap and surprisingly super clean. Close to kuta beach and a lot of places. But a little loud at night from live band in restaurant nearby.
old but clean bed . Excellent staff with hospitality skills that will do whatever it takes to make guest happy but hotel it self is not in the best shape. If you just need a place to sleep while touring Bali this is a good choice and good location
"There's dirty on the wall and on the bed sheet. Also the TV is there yet doesn't work. And another thing is when you take a shower, the flood would happen. The positive side are the location is in the middle of Kuta and also the staff are really friendly."
Good and cheap Hotel
The photos are pretty spot on with the rooms and the hotel. The staff are super friendly and always welcome you with a smile. The hotel is in a great location faith so many great eating places and spas at hand. Not far to the beach or the Main Street. Breakfast is basic but enjoyable. My only down side would be not being able to get food from the hotel after 2pm as I do love a hotel with 24 hour room service  or being able to grab a snack after a night out.
The rooms are small but clean. Good linen & towels. Cleaned daily. Sunbeds are uncomfortable and pool is shaded if that's what you like. Was priced at $29 a night at the time of travel but I am told it will go up. I'd probably search for other options if I was having to spend more as there are lots in.Bali.
"Good service from the staff, Clean room as seen on the picture."
"The hotel is beautifully arranged, not very clean due to the water dripping from the air conditioner.  The air conditioner is not very good, the room is a bit small.  7/10 compared to the price"
"Hotel is close to everything, mall, bars, resto and beach) breakfast is good, service is also good. highly recommended"
"If you are looking for a place close to Legian Street but still peaceful & quiet at night, I think this place is the right one.
I would suggest you to book pool access room. Well, i personally like that type of room.
Room is small, yes. But it is clean and still okay for 2 persons. Please noted that you can see inside the bathroom from your bed, not too clear, but I think it is gonna be awkward if you stay there with colleagues.
Don't drive your own car if you don't like small road, because it is located inside a lane. I think they also have basement parking, but not really sure.
Staffs were nice. I checked out late at night and easily got in."
"The hotel was nice. Staff are very helpful. Pool needs cleaning and repairs. The area is at the center of kuta so expect heavy heavy traffic. It's hard to book grab or taxi because of the traffic. But overall, good value as the hotel is cheap and it comes with buffet breakfast but don't expect awesome food."
"🥰We stayed here for two days , it’s very near to walk to the beach , Beach Walk shopping mall ,Hardrock cafe and 7/11 convenient stores.
😔non facilitated hotel , have to ask for appliances."
"Price is worthy for staying, location also good.
But one day morning I saw the staff washing the ashtray with the pool water, since that day i not dare to swim. Wifi is not working well, very slow to load a page or video."
"Clean linen, clean room, nice stuff.. need to be few things fixed in bathroom.."
I like the location and the pool. And the price is very reasonable.  The staff was very good and attentive.
We had a pool side room. Which was nice enough. Decent location for bars and restaurants. I would recommend.
Clean and amazing price quality offers
It was good to stay close to the airport
"Good location close to everywhere 15 minutes walking distance to beach walk mall and 2 minutes walking to legian street,good swimming pool,delicious breakfast cons room looks like smaller than in the picture has to request first if you asked for toothbrush"
"This place is in a great location but just lacks any sort of wow factor. The rooms are adequate and if you get a cheap price are good value. If like me you just want a place to rest your head this is fine, but if you like to sit around the pool and utilise hotel facilities I would probably be looking elsewhere."
I definitely stay here again. Already booked my next stay :)
"Location is quite near to all the shops, clubs and restaurants.
Just FYi you can find some miscreants standing on the roads offering drugs or girls, so just avoid them. I only find that annoying. 
There is a good cafe nearby gloria jean's.
Best for guys and couple to Stay."
A really clean hotel and the staff are helpful!
Up a side alley so off the busy road. Room lovely and clean. Bed was a bit small given O asked for an extra large bed size.
"Has eveything you would expect at that price range. Except breakfast included in the price, but i don't like flies in my food, so that doesnt matter. 
Really loud AC in the bathroom."
"Pros:
prime location , busy happening street
Cons.
Pooooor vvv Poor aircon takes hours to get chillness.
smelly bed spreads they just turn the bed sheets upside down when they do the room service ...I found that out leaving a small mark and that was same bedhseet they used the next day.
it stinkssssssssssss
Break fast   just 3 dishes fried rice, noodle and sausage keeps repeating ervday and coffe and juice for $7
opposite hotel Grand La Walon gave much better menu and food for $6 go stay there indeed 
wont stay here again.."
"I ask for double bed. It was 2 singles pushed together, kept sliding into the gap. The mini fridge, took 2 days to get slightly chilled. Had drinks in there for 4 days and still weren't cold. Very limited tv channels. 2 movie and 2 sport. The rest is indo-china tv.  There is no room service. Restaurant On my open for breakfast. Pool is shallow and not very long. Aircon is cold"
"Great hotel but if you take your own vehicle, be ready not to have a parking space as this hotel located in the narrow street and parking is just limited"
Staff was not welcoming and hotel is a bit dull. But understand after the covid phase. The price is ok if you just want to sleep and enjoy bare. The toilet doesnt have bidet. Thanks
Location is good. There is no problem with the hotel. Its a good 2.5 star hotel.
lost money. Must be locked in safety box.
No atmosphere or vibe in the pool area.   No garden or landscaping.  Bit boring hotel
"We stayed at terrace kuta for 3 days. Got the worst room they had. It was smelly, bathrooms very small and had no views. Breakfast is the most bare minimum.  Staff unable to speak english when we checked in."
Nice place but need to upgrade service and staff
We stay one night and when arrive rats was on the alley road. Room was smelly and I saw few vorms at floor. Not recommended this hotel.
location is in a small alley in the middle of busy main road. you can find a better hotel room with similar price
"Bed sheet, pillow and quilt cover smell bad. Strong musty smell. Toilet's floor was 24/7 wet due to uneven flooring. Which make the toilet disgusting.  Will not come back again.  Only one lift working. Staffs are not friendly"
"Hotel is cozy and rooms are clean (we stayed in two rooms - 4th floor and a pool access one). All the rooms get their fair share of sunlight which serves as a great wake up call, sunlight is nice for drying wet clothes too (not all hotels have access to sunlight I am afraid). If you are staying for long, you can even just wash your clothes and leave it too dry while you roam Bali - that's what we did. 
The is staff is friendly and great, they're always smiling. Housekeeping is almost always ready to clean your room too. The pool is great for cooling off after a hot day at the beach or even for day tours around Bali. You can drink beer by the pool too if you wanted. Although some room neighbors might tend to be loud if they're inconsiderate (not the hotel's fault), you can always ring up the front desk to have them keep the noise down anyway.
Location is close to both Legian St. and the beach, food around is great and cheap. Convenience stores also abound so if you are awake and hungry in the middle of the night you can always grab a candy bar or beer if you wanted to anytime.
Since Kuta is very dense and streets are small, you get to know shop owners and staff pretty quickly which is nice since they are all just very friendly. Just smile at them back and you might just win yourself good friends, great sources of information, and cheaper ""special"" deals on tours around Bali. It helps to pass by them everyday and this hotel allows you to do just that.
Fantastic Hotel overall, perhaps the very best one I have ever booked in my life time when considering everything in and around the Hotel."
We had a good stayed for 4 nights in Terrace at Kuta. A good location next to the busy Legian street and less than 10 minutes walking to Kuta beach. Nice staffs were very helpful esp in our check out day which was at 3.30 am. We didnt ask for a wake up call yet they still did it to make sure we woke up to catch our early flights. Tho they can improve facilities esp inside the rooms like small fridge and hair dryer. The got a room without a door in the shower which was quite a mess as the water flooding in the toilet area after we had a shower. Even tho this was not a really really big deal as they always made sure to clean our room daily and gave us clean towels and other things. Will come back in the future if we are going to stay in Kuta area
"This is one of those I Hesitate to Recommend this Place lest it be overrun and you can never get another reservation.  Hard to imagine in Kuta / Legian with their surfeit of amazing hotels.  And this hotel is not a ""resort"" by any stretch of the imagination.  But location, location, location.  A couple of blocks from the beach and tucked near all the action, Hotel Terrace Kuta is a bona fide extreme value with an amazingly helpful, engaging and friendly staff.  Great buffet breakfast in the morning.  Well appointed rooms with comfy bed and serious blackout curtains.  The superiority of those rooms with direct pool access can't be overstated.  You can stay somewhere else for less or certainly more IDR.  Others that are more ""experiential"".  Something else supremely sanitized where you awaken as if in a brochure.  It'd be like swimming in riptides, though.  Do so at your own peril..."
"I have to say, I am EXTREMELY impressed with Hotel Terrace @ Kuta. Excellent location, great price,  very very very clean rooms (and comfortable beds & pillows) but most importantly -  the staff absolutely made my stay from great to amazing. The three particular employees were Dewa SC, Made OM, and Ketut GM. Oh my gosh - these guys took the time to give me feedback and recommendations on the places I planned to see during my time in Kuta. I'm the type of traveler who is looking for the most organic, very 'local'  type of experience - and these guys made excellent recomendations, taught me local Balinese lingo and honestly - I looked forward to every interaction because they were just so kind and friendly! To the owner of this property - you can't put a price on excellent employees who clearly show dedication and enjoy their work. I hope to return sometime soon to Kuta and I will certainly stay at HT@Kuta as well as recomend to others!"
"The hotel is in a narrow street but well accomated with all the facilities (transport, taxi, shopping, partying) ! Very near from kuta beach and in such a pricw range great hotel to stat in! Being in a busy street of legian, we never heard that much crowd from the room! Restaurant and marts are in short walking distance! The hotel is well maintained and cleaned! Cons would be , most of the time jam packet traffic in the streets, and the rooms doesn’t have that much of view to enjoy! I hope a great hotel and great deal if you are always traveling in bali! Nice place to have sound sleep! But if you want to relax in hotel not much things to do!"
"We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Terrace at Kuta. It's a really new hotel which just grand opened on 1st Nov.2013. My friend likes this hotel a lot.I come here for business,so I need good WIFI to work,it's great that internet-speed is excellent here and availble in room. I really want to say ""thanks"" to all staff at Hotel Terrace at Kuta.Because they are very friends and helpful to us,especially the front desk girl,Sukma.She is a really nice staff here and can speak English well,Of course,the Hotel Manager,MR.I Ketut Suwastika is also very kindly to us, so I extend our booking one day and one day...I will come back for sure!"
"I am a frequent traveller to this area of the world and I like to try out different hotels to get the best value for money. You can't look past the Terrace when on a budget. I got a pool side room for less than 50AUD a night (not including breakfast) . The pool was excellent, had some sun during the day but was also partly shaded which allowed for a nice water temperature. The room was very modern and sleek. Not a huge size but if you are enjoying Bali you are not in your room that much. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and  so were the pillows. Bedding was clean and well maintained as were the towels. No fancy toiletries but who needs that for the price. The Television had a mediocre variety of English speaking channels - certainly enough to watch a little telly falling off the sleep. The location was the STAR of the show. Was right in the middle of everything. 5 minutes walk to Legian street and all the action there and just 10 minutes to the beach. Will definitely stay again ."
"Really enjoyed my stay in Hotel Terrace last October. The hotel is located in Kuta, a busy/overcrowded area in Bali. The area going to the hotel is full of one-way, narrow streets so expect some heavy traffic on your way there. It is not that difficult to find as there is a large sign on the side of the road (hard to miss). There are plenty of bars, convenience stores and souvenir shops around (basically anything you can think of). My room was clean and located at the topmost floor overlooking the pool. It was clean and looked like your typical 3-star hotel. I love how the bathroom had a built-in bidet in the toilet! The pool was good, only 5 ft deep. The staff were helpful and can understand/speak English well."
"We are 2 friends travelling through Bali and our first stay was at the Terrace Hotel in Kuta. Half an hour drive from the airport in Denpasar, and we arrived in the busy centre of Kuta. The hotel though, was quite peacefully and calm (no noice from the busy streets). Very warm welcome from the friendly staff and very clean rooms! We slept really well (very good beds!) after a long flight!  There were 2 types of breakfast: asian or   european - buffetstyle! Also a big pool to find refreashment! :)"
"I stayed in Terrace Hotel at kuta for 5 nights. The hotel is located in a nice place in kuta. All what you need is beside : the beach restaurants bars nights club shopping center.
The rooms are clean and well organised with daily make up. The staff and security are really nice and very polite and helpful specially reception team. The pool is not that big but its cute. I recommend it for a nice stay in kuta Bali."
"we spent about 2 weeks in 4 hotels this time in jakarta (ibis), lombok (santika), bali (terrace), surabaya (ibis)... 
i must tell, this ""terrace hotel in kuta"" satisfied us the most...clean, modern, nice swimming pool, not far from beach, ... especially i have to mention to the bathroom.. the toilet is wonderful... very modern...and there is an extra function, play-boys and girl should try ..... 
well, kuta is a little bit too much commercial. 
to this rate, i do recommend this hotel to you."
"This hotel is one of the best options compared to older hotels in Kuta beach. It's a new property. It's very clean, they offer a nice breakfast buffet and you can order your omelette anyway you wish.
The hotel staff is very kind. They're always ready to help and they always smile. Balinese people in general are very kindhearted and treating them likewise goes a long way.
My room although didn't have a view, maybe I paid the very low end price at Agoda for it, it was super nice. They provided water everytime they cleaned my room. The AC worked just fine and the location in Kuta beach is unbeatable. 
I would only recommend the guests to be very careful when booking activities out on the streets. Shop around a lot. Do not take the first option even if they say no one offers the same for the same price, that's not true!  Do not pay less than $25 for the water rafting activity, we literally got ripped off. 
This hotel for the price is so right, there's really nothing bad to say about it. Always keep in mind that you get what you pay for. This one was a nice surprise for being so affordable on Agoda.  I guess I just got lucky!"
"We were so pleased with our stay at The Terrace. The breakfast each morning was varied, the location was in a quiet street off Legian road not far from Kuta beach, the pool access room was so convenient, the rooms were cleaned well every day but what impressed us the most was the staff and their high level of service. My son had an accident at a restaurant nearby  and needed to go to and from the hospital during our stay and the manager arranged his driver to take us each and every time - complimentary! It sure did lessen the worry, in such an already stressful situation, not having to arrange transport! We can’t thank you enough! We would very happily stay here again and again!"
"This hotel was a pleasant surprise. Have stayed at many hotels in Bali, from 3 to 5 stars and was pleasantly surprised at how nice this one is for the price! Rooms are on the smaller side but that is made up for by the great quiet location just off Jl Legian, icy cold air conditioning, good water pressure in the shower and a nice pool area. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We got poolside rooms for around $50 per night and we feel these rooms we're an absolute bargain at this price. Hotel grounds are clean and well maintained. Would definitely stay here again."
"The rooms will have everything you need from minibar, safe, to a small balcony over the pool if you’re on the higher levels. The wifi was great for a Bali hotel and even the hot water was better than most hotels! The bathroom was clean and modern, with a frosted glass wall that’s pretty sleek. Friendly staff and room service will come later even if you sleep in most the day :P. Good location for Kuta clubs and Legian beaches. Just off the main road for privacy and close enough to walk to both the beach and the clubs."
"The hotel is about half-a-block from Jl.Legian but is so quiet. Staff are helpful but unobtrusive. Rooms clean, modern and aircon works perfectly. We had rooms on 5th floor (top) - teens had twin Deluxe room and we had Premier room which we kept for an extra day as our flight wasn't til late at night and it accommodated all 4 of us comfortably for the day. Bed was huge and comfy, pillows were perfect (little too fat for husband's liking though, but they were soft so he coped). 
In-house menu is available 11am-3pm, good snacks at reasonable prices. Drinks fridge with the basics available from reception also at reasonable prices. 
Turn left out of the hotel driveway along Jl.Benesari for good cafes at better prices than the Jl.Legian tourist offerings. Follow Jl.Benesari further and you pop out at the beach. 
Turn right out of the driveway and right onto Jl.Legian for all the cheap tshirts and batik bags you'll ever need. Or walk 20mins or so towards Kuta market for more of the same,"
