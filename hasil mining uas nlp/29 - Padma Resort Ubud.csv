"Probably one of the best stay I ever had in Bali. The location is very secluded but it’s very romantic and you can do lots of activities inside. The staffs are the friendliest and most helpful. We also have our own butler that can help us with our needs. You can feel the luxury from the first step in the lobby. If you bring kids, you can bring them to animal garden, kids club and pool. You can do golf, yoga, archery, and many other activities here. The swimming pool are the best, with warm temperature that will make you feel refreshed. The food are all amazing, especially the all you can eat breakfast. The quality really shines through. The afternoon tea package is also amazing. You can also do massage and spa as well. Overall, There’s really nothing I could complain. Very recommended."
"Away fr the crowd and Ubud Central , initially my husband was grumbling why pay so much for an inconvenient place. But I told him the review online was all 5 stars, let's see. We were greeted with great hospitality upon arrival, clean instruction on what are the complimentary activities available and how to book etc. The facilities are beautiful and fully equipped. I was surprised it's heated pool, the yoga venue is so picturesque and cool, the spa massage is awesome. I am a vegetarian, I have some nice food. I walked into the jungle trail and garden for some nice pictures. If u like activities, this will be a prefect place. I would recommend a minimum of 3 nights, I stayed 2 nights, can't cover all the activities. If u like a quieter, fresh air stay, this resort suit you."
"Best resort in Ubud! Big, spacious, luxury and extremely comforable hotel. Love the view, the vibes, the ambience, the pool, the breakfast and of course the hospitality & service rendered by the hotel staffs. Definitely my first choice when visiting Ubud and Bali! The room on 1st floor is the best with direct access to garden, jungle track and all the best the resort can offer! Simply awesome!🤎"
"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon stay in Ubud and we were so blown away! It was the most beautiful views as Padma is located so high up you can see all of the valley and forest. We really enjoyed having breakfast outside and enjoying the most amazing cocktails by the pool. That pool is the most amazing pool one will ever come across with warm water and most amazing views.
Padma is the resort which caters for all - honeymooners (like ourselves), families and friends because of all of the amenities and activities there are to do. It is so lush and green and the animal garden is amazing.
The highlight for us are the yoga studios, which is in a nest in the forest. We did aerial yoga with Tama as our instructor. That is the place where my mind and soul were completely at east and I went into a deep state of relaxation. 
Ubud is a special place and Padma definitely carries that theme of renewing one's soul and state of mind."
"Padma Resort is one of the most breathtaking resorts we have ever been to. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. The resort is extremely beautiful with the most gorgeous views onf wild nature. Honestly, I’ve been to a lot of 5-star resorts worldwide, and this place was my favorite. 
The rooms are of incredibly clean, quiet and of high quality - great mattress, bedding, pillows, lightning, welcome fruit basket, amenities, etc. The pool is gigantic and there is almost nothing you cannot do - there is a massive botanical garden and a mini zoo, a trail that takes you down to the river and the jungle, lots of activities like golf, archery and yoga (all inclusive!). The Spa was one of the best ones I’ve ever been to as well. This place is truly 5 stars and I whole-heartedly recommend it to both couples and families. Elta, the guest relationship manager, was incredibly lovely and helpful too. This place is incredible! Perhaps the only thing they could improve on is the food and drinks."
"Even the location is still 30 minutes drive away from Ubud city centre, but definitely a great and nice stay at Padma. Facilities and activity are various to make people comfortable stay at Padma. Legit breakfast with breathtaking view. Thank you Padma"
"This was the best hotel I have ever been to. The staff was super accommodating and helpful. The facilities were clean and enjoyable. The food was high quality and easily accessible. I had a wonderful stay. I would recommend, and plan on returning."
"The infinite pool is gorgeous and warm, the view is immensely beautiful so we spent much time in  the pool. Staff is so friendly and helpful. The food is great and fresh. Only 30min  drive to Kintamani. What a lovely place.."
"We had a fabulous stay at Padma Resort to celebrate our son’s 3rd birthday. Breakfast spread was truly amazing with a magnificent view. Highlight was definitely the Bali voyage tour we booked with the resort, would recommend it to everyone. Agus was a fantastic guide & an awesome photographer as well."
"We’ve been stay in Padma Ubud Resort for more than a week and it’s wonderful. All the staffs members are friendly and helpful, always find the best way to suite our journeys.Choice of activities are variety, cover all ages range from kids to adults.
We’re looking forward to our next holiday stay in Padma again, hopefully the Otter couple “Chiko & Chika” adding a few family members soon."
"It is VERY HARD to find what is missing or negative about staying in Padma Ubud. Everything is exceptional.
I really like about the Outdoor experiences, where the staffs are really humble and polite, to guide us through all of the sessions.
The bed is really comfortable, I am having the best sleep ever in Padma's pillow and bed.
The breakfast is really good and the variance is really colorful.  I really like the fresh juices and the Pain au Chocolat.
The view is really amazing, the air is breathtaking, the temperature around the hotel is really good.
Definitely will come back."
"A wonderful hotel with many activities to indulge in. We had the pleasure of Sudana taking our classes (yoga, archery and golf) and he was very friendly and helped us with the activities. He also remembered our names outside of the classes which was a nice and friendly touch. 
Would be nice to see more vegetarian option on the dinner menus but was a really pleasant and great stay. Highly recommended!"
"We liked the Resort very much. We enjoyed the Pool, both Restaurants with great staff. Everything was perfect, especially The Kids Club with Sri. She was very friendly, helpful and thanks to her we felt there like at home. Thank you so much! We will come back!"
"What I expect about Ubud is represented in this hotel. Very peaceful, clean, great services, good food and luxurious. I would stay more than a day in the near future"
"Only One word can describe Padma Ubud. Best of the best hotel/resort. 
The view are amazing, staffs is really2 friendly. I booked 2 rooms and  they are super clean. Facilities are amazing. Wish I could stay longer. But it was sold out. Everybody have to stay in Padma Ubud. Super recomended."
"Whenever I go to Bali, Ubud must be the first place to stay. I really want to enjoy staying at the hotel, play the activities - sure with kids zona as well & explore the hotel area. Then I knew that I have to choose Padma Resort Ubud that has what I want 😁.
Delicious foods, warm afternoon coffee, great butler and all staffs are all you need.
My husband, son & I really enjoy our 2 nights stay here. And sure will come back again 😉
Thanks! And keep up the great work.
God bless"
"Padma is actually very famous resort in Ubud. And it comes up to my expectations.
There are lots of programs in the resort. So you can enjoy many things there :)"
"Incredible stay at Padma Resort Ubud right from initial reception to check out. Smooth check in / out with Dadb and Diandra, which optimised my time during my stay. 
Andi the sopir (driver) took me into town (Ubud) and filled me in on the local vibe. There I got to try Naughty Nuri’s pork ribs (local favourite) and browse some of the local shops. 
Back at Padma, i was able to partake in some of their offerings, such as the bike tour (thanks Piska), the eternity pool (Tina x 2, Karini, Tama), balinese massage and the fabulous dining, including the Padma signature dessert 
Vanilla Creme Brulee and a several pork dishes (in anticipation of a pork absence in returning to Jakarta). At the kitchen I would like to thank Solo - sous chef, Merlin, Desak, Asin, Windtari all the rest of the serving and kitchen staff."
"Best nature view, many activities for kids and adult, nice pool, big and spacious room, balcony direct to garden, comfort spa for couple, breakfast at two different restaurant with view. Definitely will come back."
"A comfortable and clean hotel, the staff mrs elta dan mrs  deby are friendly and communicative, the facilities hotel are many,the breakfast is delicious. the swimming pool is nice and the children love the mini zoo , see you next holiday at padma ubud again."
"All the staffs are very welcoming! Room was maintain very well.  Far from the ubud central surrounding with beautiful jungle, Great hideout from the busy ubud!  Hotel privide many activity such as a golf, yoga, archery, etc so never boring. Warm water in the swimming pool! We loved it💙"
"My dauther love it and us too. Staffs are very helpful and deft. Room clean and spacious. Fresh air. Amazing bathroom, huge bath tub which me and my dauther love."
"The hotel’s great. The facilities are awesome. The animal farm, flower and vegetable gardens, the jogging track through the valley are all spectacular if you’re craving nature like we were.
One issue, during our stay there was a gala dinner in the hotel’s facility and the noise was loud beyond believe. Like we were staying next to a stadium. Even though it only lasted an hour or two, it was enough to wake my daughter more than a few times.
It might not happen often and we were just unlucky, but I have to include it here cause I chose to stay here for nature and tranquility. 
Besides that, it’s a very pleasant hotel with top tier staff and service."
"Words can’t express how wonder my newly wife and I stay was here. The staff were amazing, shout out to (pitri and lenu). The excursion were also great, the resort made sure we had a wonderful experience, organizing every detail to make sure we get to enjoy every second. Highly recommend"
"I didn’t feel like leaving this hotel! Everything was so good!
If you plan on going out , you won’t be able to find grab or Gojek , have to use the hotel transport services .
This is definitely the best hotel I stayed in bali"
This is a beautiful beautiful beautifulllll resort in Ubud. Tucked away in the forest. Super secluded with stunning views. Rooms are big and spacious and decorated to perfection. Breakfast was so good. Pool is heated. Staff is very kind. I can’t wait to come back
"unforgettable vacation with my family at Padma Resort Ubud. Best hotel at Ubud area. Many indoor and outdoor activites,, best pool with view. 5 star breakfast and dining... all thumbs up"
"Fabulous resort which has all the needed facilities. Loved the bed in a spacious room as well as the bathroom supplies.
Super kids friendly, we dropped our kids to the kids club, they had outdoor activities in the morning and indoor activities in the afternoon. The girls were super nice and friendly, our kids had a fabulous time and my husband and me enjoyed the infinity pool during the time.
Amazing heated pool with instance Ubud Mountain View. Nothing to complain. We enjoyed, loved it and definitely will come back!"
"The room is clean and spacious and also homey. They dont serve to many option for the breakfast menus, but it taste good! I really love the heated pool. The activity for kids also fun and entertaining. The room service always good and staff also helpful. Padma ubud is always bcoming my first choice when i stay at ubud. Much love!"
"This is the best resort & hotel i've ever stayed at for my life..
Especially ...for trveller wz child is perfect place...
Why?
Just stay here without asking.."
"Second time staying at this hotel, just love  everything. 
Modern  furnished room ,  beautiful restaurant with pool and jungle scenes.  Lovely path  for morning walk to the small river down there. Excellent yoga area with bambo terrace. Everything just  gorgeous!!!"
This is one of the best resorts I have stayed in over the years with my international travel experience. The customer service is par excellence and Awesome buffet.  Traveling with a 4 yr old with the best kid club in the area. Staff is excellent and lots of kids activities. I wouldn’t look elsewhere to book stay while in ubud and would pick this in a heartbeat. The infinity pool is amazing. Will definitely be visiting this property again.
"This place is perfect in every way. Has many activities, such as yoga, walking tracks, and golf. 
The staff remember you and outstanding at catering for dietary needs"
"The service at the hotel is top-notch and staff is so committed  to ensure you are happy with your experience during your stay.  The weather is cool being you are in the mountains but the pool is warmed up for you so all is good! Highly recommend the Premier Club Lounge if you are adults, as the alcohol is free with daily snacks and the best breakfast ever!"
Beautiful resort in the middle of nowhere but full of surprises and lots of activities to enjoy !!! One of the best !!!
"It was a pity we just stayed for one day. The pool was so relaxing with warm water, room was spacious. Definitely will come back"
"In jungle worderful place!

"PERFECTO.

Thank you so much :)"
Love the resort. It has its own jogging track to animal garden also down to the river. The room and facilities are clean and well manintained. Recommended.
All hotel staff were very friendly. Hotel has many great facilities and activities for kids. Very recommended stay - although location is a bit far from Ubud center (but they provide shuttle bus service)
"Nice staffs, great food, amazing facilities. I love the resort❤️"
"Satisfied, even its quite far from everywhere..but worthed much. Especially the Bfast at Puhu Rest, many choices of menus"
Wonderful!!!
Good view ..delicious food n kind staff...very recommended 👍👍
Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful cannot fault the service. The hotel garden and pool is amazing. We didn’t actually leave the hotel in our two nights there as it’s a bit of a drive into Ubud town centre and we were happy to relax by the pool.
"This is my third stay at the hotel. I love the pristine rain forest and the peaceful and serene vibes surrounding the hotel. That’s why the location is so far out however Gofood is available too if you are willing to pay Rp 50 for the delivery which is ok.  The room and the bathroom plus the amenities are lovely.  However, the in-room coffee machines need to be replaced as I never know how to operate it even though I follow the instruction; coffee machine shouldn’t be rocket science to operate. The food during breakfast is nice, very heart warming as most are Indonesian or Balinese dishes,  sedap sekali, although standard western dishes are  also available.  The coffee shop manager, ibu Pia is so friendly and helpful, she’ll help with our requests and questions even though it may extend outside the domain of coffee shop. Thanks ibu Pia, much appreciated! The dining on hotel premise is reasonably priced. They also offer shuttle to Ubud Center.  There are many activities in the hotel, yoga in the morning, biking, trekking etc. the programs are well thought out! Will I come back, you bet!"
It was an amazing experience staying in Padma Ubud!
The hotel was very good both location and their facilities. The scenery is very very good for anyone who loves the mountain and nature.
Best service & best honeymoon stay! Will definitely come back again
"The surroundings are breathtaking, right in the jungle. The hotel is clean and staff very friendly. Pool area is amazing"
"If you look for a tranquility, this is the place. Located in village Puhu, close to Kintamani lake, you will find a serene and peaceful place to stay.
If you look for a good food, this is the place. Variety of breakfast is superb! The hotel provides different Balinese cuisine that will tease our palette. Puhu restaurant also serves good food for lunch and dinner.
If you look for a top notch customer experience, this is the place. All the staffs really live the service excellent. They will do the extra mile to exceed the customer satisfaction. Extra credit to the F&B Manager, Ibu Pia, who shows up every single morning to greet all the customers at the restaurant for breakfast.
It’s a complete package for a perfect holiday!"
"Love the place especially with young children
Kid’s club, pool, mini zoo
Food is great and service is remarkable 
The only downside is very inconvenient .
It’s ideal to have have your own car"
"Padma Ubud Resort is ideal for anyone. All staffs are so kind, helpful. We strongly recommended, bcs many facilities with fun activities such as fishing, archery, golf & the food’s taste are delicious 👍👍"
Best place to escape from the hectic and busy cities
"Great ambience, friendly staff, great food, awesome pool."
"Nothing to complaint about, top notch  services, excellent facilities, the room is very well maintained. We will definitely come back."
Must try night swimming 👍 and also the jogging track in nature atmosphere 👍
"Very large comfortable room, with amazing pool."
Our second visit to Padma Ubud and once again an amazing experience at all levels.
"Great resort hotel, with all the amenities you need to have an enjoyable holiday."
"recommended hotel , I stay 2 nights in this hotel , at nigh the temperature cool  . friendly staff , breakfast have variety food ."
Our family happy to stay here. Staff are friendly and approachable especially staff in Restaurant.
"An oasis in Ubud, first class service and food. Amazing !!!"
Swimming pool is amazing
"Nice stay, quiet place, suutsble to relax eacape from hustle bustle city life..."
Top👏🏻❤️
"Plusses : Cleanliness, greenery, peaceful, fresh air.  Kids and adults enjoys being greeted by beautiful ground and koi pools at lobby.  Fish feeding 3xdaily, animal area more complete than most even has a pair of adorable otters.  Very thankful to all the staff, special mention Pak Made from the Animal park and who also turned out to be amazing guide to our family on the  beginners golf.  Another special mention to Tina who served us dinner at the poolside restaurant.  Truly service with a smile"
Superr luxury
"Fantastic pool, top class resort services, great food and world-class staff. They bumped us up to a bigger room, gave us a higher floor as requested, and threw in a cupcake for our anniversary - how cute. Hotel had barely any guests at the time of stay too, which meant late check out. Special mention to the in-house pharma and the 24-hour butler for seeing to my sickly needs. 
That being said the location's bit out of the way, so gojek/grab drivers will be hard to come by when going. The hotel does provide a shuttle service, but they forgot to inform us that we had to pre-book it 4 hours to 1 day in advance, which meant we had to pay a premium for their private driver service to take us to Ubud. Also be sure to check the weather when for your stay - the rain easily spoils the novelty of the pool.
Would come back on a dry months!"
Best view ever
"Will come back and join jungle trekking and bike 
Must interesting"
Was a great experience. Would definitely visit again for its kindness
"All in one in one hotel Padma no need to go outside anymore…
Love this hotel!!!"
This hotel is located an hour away from Ubud centre and the hotel makes sure you are not getting bored with many activities and unlimited complimentaries (for Premium Club)
"Super nice hotel and full of facilities and most of them free..
But the location really far from the town"
"It’s good hotel to have relax, the staff is nice, food is delicious and complete, the pool is warm and big enough.Only one thing i don’t like, it’s far from the city, so you have take long drive.But overall is fine"
"Staff very kind, best services, a li uvchosen of activities during my stay, will comeback here i the future...👍🏻"
"Love this hotel, spacious room, clean and feel relax stay here. The staff is friendly and helpful and foods are excellent. The cool weather in Ubud and good memorable time while staying here will not forget and will be coming back again in next trip."
"The price of room is very expensive in agoda, asking the staff and book directly is more cheaper then using agoda, and extra bed charge very expensive too. The price more expensive more then 100% each day, and extra bed is different 200%++,  please check ur price with agoda, thanks"
"The resort itself is beautiful it's just a long way out of central Ubud. If you're after a relaxing holiday spending most of your time in the resort, perfect.  If you want restaurants and bars it's a 35min drive into Ubud, nothing with in walking distance."
"Room was great, pool was awesome, food was just meh.."
"I and my daughter went Padma hotel without my husband. Cause he was super busy. Most of the staffs are kind and nice(Especially women), but some seems like that they discriminated against other family. I think it was kind of racial discrimination or the thing because I didn’t go there with my husband. 
When I went fishing, the staff told me that it was not able to do it, (even though 30 min left) but 10 min later I saw the other family was doing the fishing. 
And I also went the restaurant for welcome drink, the staff provided us only 2 Hibiscus tea without any inquiry. But but other family was able to order various kind of tea or coffee, and chocolate milk for kids cause they asked what they want for welcome drink. 
Since my daughter is just 8 years old and she could not drink at all. 
I am so disappointed at the staff’s attitude and I want to upload this to web community in my country."
If you do not like overcrowded hotels with a lot of  children then do not choose this hotel for stay....even for breakfast you have to wait to be in line and get table....
Everything was great except we got food poisoning from their Nasi goreng. Was surprised because everything else was very clean and the staff were very attentive
"Despite being more expensive than Padma Bandung the experience was kinda inferior to it. The location is very far from places to eat, meaning you are mostly stuck to eat at their restaurants. The most positive thing from our stay was the Kid’s club, the staff there was super attentive to our son, especially Miss Rini. Thank you miss Rini!"
Way too many kids. Probably good for families but not couples.
"Although view was amazing, it is quite hidden and had to call for a grab. Facilities is ok there is just enough facilities for 1 or 2 nights. Just the one restaurant and the one pool so it’s quite small."
"The covid protocols are simply for show, you fill out a form stating you have no symptoms but it doesn't stop you from hearing guests coughing and sniffing throughout your entire stay. 
Our temperatures were checked every time we entered the restaurant, however we blatantly witnessed local guests walking through without theirs being taken. 
They are currently running a promo for 1.2 per night but only for local guests. My partner and I were made to pay 3.6 million which is 3 x the amount. 
Given the promo running, the resort is full and isn't really pleasant for people like us who are paying an inflated price. 
Seeing as we're paying triple the price of 99% of other guests at the hotel, the standards of staff, room, food etc aren't to the level of which we paid. 
We came here 1-2 years ago and had great memories! The pool used to actually be heated now its not (they claim it is) but its obvious they are trying to cut costs.
We aren't surprised that we are the only westerners staying, as the currently pricing is based on nationality. Which we find very strange. 
The hotel is running service that is worth 1.2 million but not the 3.6 we paid. Super disappointed as they've dropped standards of everything which reflects the price being offered (but not to us)
Wish them all the best but we learnt for ourselves and will not return or recommend."
"I can't say enough good things about the Padma Ubud. It has big, beautiful, spacious rooms with balconies that give a view of the jungle and surrounding hills. You can sit outside on your balcony and enjoy the cooler Ubud climate while listening to the birds chirp. The dining area too has spectacular views of the ubud jungles, so too for that matter does the long wrap around heated swimming pool. The food was excellent and the staff were both very friendly and superbly professional.
 
What impressed me most of all though was the river walk – a good length, scenic, circular walk through the jungle on a smooth path down to a river below all within the hotel property itself. They also have extraordinary flower gardens in the resort that you can walk through as an alternative to the river walk.
Though the secluded and peaceful nature of the resort was very much an upside for me, if you are hoping to spend most of your time out sight-seeing then this resort may not be ideal for you as it’s a 40 minute drive just to Ubud town and I’d imagine a few hours to the beach. However, as someone with young children who preferred to spend most of my time in resort, going for walks and swimming with the kids and just enjoying sitting on the hotel room balcony enjoying the view I couldn’t have asked for more than the Padma Ubud."
"It was a first time for me to stay in Ubud as normally I would choose beach area whenever I visited Bali. But, this time, I tried Padma Resort in Ubud to stay in Ubud area. And it was really an amazing experience. The weather especially, it was cooling and refreshing. Furthermore the hotel was surrounded with a superb lush of greenery. The hotel size is not so big compared too many five stars hotels that I have ever stayed, it is just nice - two restaurants, spa, gym, swimming pool, kids club to name the facilities that they provide and all these do not require a long walk. To score the points, they make use the extra spaces and lands that they own with farming, garden, mini zoo and tracking track in the forest, which is really smart idea as guests can experience something different. I really recommend Padma Ubud for people who want to get away from the hectic life. The hotel itself is secluded and perhaps take 30 mins ride to Ubud city center. But this is the whole point of escaping f"
"Padma resort was the best resort we have stayed in Ubud, Bali!! It is so amazing in the middle of the jungle!! We went there for our honeymoon and they make it so special for us!! The room was huge, spacious, beautiful decorated, big comfortable beds, big bathroom, big balcony with jungle view. It was really breathtaking wake up every morning and see the view. Also the pool was amazing with jungle view!! We love the pool!  Moreover the breakfast was excellent! It had variety of food. The staff was really friendly and polite!! All were perfect!! Love padma resort! Highly recommended!!"
"Everything here was just sublime. From the moment we arrived we were blown away by the natural beauty of the surrounding environment. Most pictures will not do the beauty justice. The highlight, of course, is the swimming pool. It's a stunning view and we could have spent hours just sipping on cocktails at the edge of the infinity pool.
The rooms were huge, impeccably clean and offered gorgeous views of the rainforest, and in our case, the pool as well.
The service was first rate. Every worker is beyond kind and is eager to help, but without being in your face or pushy; a perfect balance really.
If you are traveling as a couple, I would highly recommend booking the romantic dinner package at the Bale Bamboo Bungalow; a private table set a few dozen meters from the resort. They surrounded the table with flower petals and candles, creating a very romantic atmosphere. The 6 course meal that came with the package was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. Thank you Padma Resort Ubud"
"Padma Resort was beyond our expectations! Absolutely stunning lush greenery at every turn. The room was much larger than we had antipicated with beautiful finishes. The resort was extremely clean, comfortable and had incredible views! 
The pool is absolutely stunning! A true paradise in the rainforest. 
The only thing is the resort is far out of downtown Ubud. We had three drivers tell us how ""far away"" Padma is from the center of town. 
We highly recommend staying at Padma and can't wait to return!"
"Our experience at Padma Ubud was nothing short of wonderful. The staff were genuinely friendly and the facilities were great. 
This is one of the few places that has a heated main pool and a very large one at that, once you've tried it, every other hotel will feel below par in comparison. 
The resort boasts secluded views of the surrounding Ubud countryside and the main restaurant is on the 4th floor (resort is on a hill) giving a great vantage point from which to enjoy meals or a coffee. 
Do take advantage of some of the hotel activities such as sunrise and sunset yoga. A special mention to 2 staff Arya from yoga and Sudana one of our guides for our village tour - all the staff are lovely however!"
"Me and my husband love everything about this hotel. 
With no doubt we highly recommended Padma Resort Ubud to all of you whom looking for a place to stay. The hotel is very cozy, peacefull, comfy, so relaxing, excellent breakfast, luxury bedroom and bathroom, very clean, nice environment, very friendly staff and thank you for our anniversary compliments.
Will visit again next time."
"Padma Resort Ubud is a quite nice place to stay. unfortunately i only had 1 day to lived here. but it was a memorable experiences.
I did some activities with my wife, like swimming in the infinity pool, bicycling around the resort area, having a dinner at the restaurant, and etc. 
I ask my wife, will she want to go back to this resort? and the answer is yes.
so i hope we could have an opportunity to go back to Padma Ubud in a next trip to Bali!!"
"We enjoyed our Stay very much And can't wait to come back some Day! The staff Is brilliant... The Rooms superb, The Pool- no words!!! We had a amazing Massage at The spa, which we really recommend to take advantage of !! We love it! And it was a true pleasure And experience to Stay at padma Resort Ubud!!! Thank you.. Eva&Marian"
"We spent the first two days of our honeymoon at this property and we were thoroughly spoilt.
The view from our room was beautiful and the surroundings were calm, quiet and very peaceful. 
The room and bathroom were very spacious. The bed was super comfy!!
Breakfast spread was very generous and the food was delicious! I fell in love with one of their 'sambal' sauces and when I asked one of the wait staff where I could buy something similar outside the hotel, he brought the chef to me and had her explain the recipe. 
The service at this property was remarkable!!! Restaurant, Pool Bar, Lobby Lounge, Spa, Housekeeping, Front Desk...I have never experienced such great service!!!
Our stay at Padma Ubud was overall exceptional!!! We will definitely be back."
"Located in the middle of a village, Padma Resort Ubud is great for a getaway from busy city life. The jogging track goes to a nice riverbank and the swimming pool is very nice. This is a new hotel so the staff isn't very experienced and organized."
"What an amazing resort. When we initially booked it, we were worried about the location but when we arrived we were so happy with our decision. We couldn't get enough of the pool, this is where we spent most of our time. There is a shuttle to Ubud which takes about 35 minutes. Highly recommend it, the resort is beautiful with a lot of activities to do. We will be back, thanks for having us Padma."
"first of all, i would like to thank for their good services from the front office to cleaning service. facilities: they have a warm swimming pool for kids and adults pool. Wifi - fast. Kids Club - Excellent (clean and they have so many kind of toys).They also provide yoga class, bike mountain and jogging track. I was travelling with young children and group. We all enjoyed to spend our holiday in Padma Ubud Resort."
"Everything at Padma Resort was on point!! The rooms, the views, the staff and of course the pool. About 40 mins from Ubud centre, free shuttles into centre, but it was nice to stay out of the city centre in the jungle. I'll be going back there on my next stay."
"Pros : The view, the air, the room, the food, the warm pool, the jogging track, the afternoon tea and the most of it is the kids club (thumbs up). Felt so relax staying here. Perfect resort
Cons : Nothing
Absolutely will come back for longer stay next time. Thank you Padma Ubud Resort"
We had an amazing stay at the Padma Resort. The location in the middle of the rainforest is incredible and all of the facilities of a very high standard. The pool is as lovely as the photos suggest and we particularly enjoyed the bike ride around the surrounding villages with our guide. We took away some really fabulous memories with us.
"Did not realise how far this property was from UBUD another 30 mins. Hotel running a monopoly with driver services and charge through the roof although that was my fault for not being organised with my drivers also. Room, ground and facilities were Superb and can not fault. The food was 'good' not 'great' as you would expect from a hotel like Padma."
"Visit this property to unwind and get my private time to enjoy peacefulness and quite holiday. Padma Ubud could give you both healthy and relax environment, as they had jogging track for me to run every morning and also huge swimming pool and nice gym corner to do all your sports adrenaline activities. Food is good as well as they over not only taste of your tongue but taste of your eyes to see the beautiful forest scenery of ubud."
We only stayed for 1 night. It's to bad cause you should stay at least 3 nights. Their longest infinity pool in ubud is heated and elevated. So the view was marvelous. Room was spacious and luxurious. Balcony voew to the valey was peacefull. Food are great. Service was excellent. Definable will come back to Padma Ubud.
"I think the Resorts is very good. I think you guys should book the Premier room. As it gives you access to the hotel club. It could be use througout the day. Freeflow of snacks, beverages, includes alcholic drinks. The best part is the best view from the hotel. Its very mesmerising, I could still vividly imagine I am there looking at the view. Its spectacular. The food is good, the room is nice. There are plenty of activities you could do throughout the day. A minimum two days stay to really enjoy ubud and the resort.
In additions, the pool is warm. WoWwww"
"What a resort! It’s beautiful facilities with amazing view. But once you inside the resort you are kinda stuck in there because is far from ubud central where all the shops, restaurants and cafes. You just need to eat and drinks from the resort. Staff are all friendly and speak good English. Good breakfast. Heated pool at nite. We will be back here again for sure."
good

Nic3 place to have fun with all fam
we've stayed here for 3 days. It was the best resort ever. All of the workers are very friendly and nice. I would definitely come back to stay here with my family! Highly recommend
"The food is delicious in all three restaurants, and the menu is very diverse. 
The rooms are super comfortable, beautifly decorated, clean, very good quality.
The service is excellent, I texted them through whatsapp several times and they had a great efficient, fast response."
1 night doesn’t enough
Grande e vecchio
Everything is the best
"I will be back to padma with family, totally enjoy all of the aspects. Perfect"
I love the forest around the resort and very peaceful and nice staff. The morning yoga was also a good experience. I will definitely visit again if i go to Bali once more.
