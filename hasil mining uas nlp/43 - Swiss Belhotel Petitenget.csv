"So far, I've stayed at Aveda twice. I booked the junior suite room the first time, which is very good for that price; the room is spacious, the bathroom is also big, it has large and comfy bed, and the hotel breakfast was okay. But, during the weekends, it's pretty loud at night because the hotel is right next to a popular restaurant and bar, Da Maria, where they have a DJ party every weekend. If you're sensitive to noise, you probably will be annoyed because the music party last until 3 AM and sometimes a bit more. The second time I booked,  I stayed in the standard room in the far back building. This time I heard a less loud noise on the weekends. The standard room is also very cozy, and it has a balcony. I didn't take the hotel breakfast package during my second stay because the hotel is surrounded by many restaurants that serve great breakfast within walking distance, such as Nook, Monsieur Spoon, Livingstone, Cocotte Bistrot, and many more. Overall, I had a pleasant stay at Aveda."
"Close to everywhere and close to the beach. Good caring and friendly staff (very helpful).  We stay there for up to a week or so and we feel like it's our second home.  Price sometimes up and down, but we could always get the best deal from Agoda.  We have even have our own regular room to stay (by request) everytime we are in Bali as for the beautiful fresh greenish paddy view right from the balcon.  Food is good,  cozy swimming pool.  We always have a good stay in Aveda.   We love Aveda👍🙏❤️"
"Travelling with group of friends and all stays at the same hotel is so much fun. The room ( we stayed at Jr. Suite with pool view ), the view ( paddy field ), the cleanliness, the hospitality,  the location are perfect..  the hotel surrounded by Livingstone Bakery & Cafe , Greek Resto, Monsieur Spoon Cafe, nearby Nook, close to many  interesting places. The things that should be improved  are: variety of breakfast menu and hotel corridor lighting. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay in Aveda Boutique Hotel, recommended hotel in Bali at a reasonable price . 👍"
"I'm not kidding. I got cheap price from Agoda for this hotel and did not set my expectation high.
But as soon as I stepped in to the hotel, I found this hotel is amazing!
1 - Staffs are amazing! I requested to have white linen for the bed, and they accommodate the request right away
2 - Again, staffs. I stayed in the nearby hotel the night before, by the time I checked in my luggages are still in the previous hotel. Staffs were very very kind to help contacting that hotel to send my luggages, and they even send it straight to my room. Amazing service.
3 - The room itself. Spacious, very clean, good lighting, unlimited soap.
The only negative thing is the noise from nearby bar (Da Maria) which was opened until 1AM on Sunday can be heard clearly from my room (which was located exactly next to the bar).
Maybe if my room was separated by 1 or 2 rooms away, the noise will be reduced.
But it's new year anyway. So I got nothing to complaint 😂."
"the staffs are really friendly and super helpful. Great facilities but they should hire more staff to clean the rooms, because the time i was supposed to check in was 1pm but they said that the room is not ready yet, so i went to the nearby cafe until 5pm because i needed to open my working laptop. by the time i arrived at the hotel receptionist to check in the told me that my room is still not ready? i was so pissed at that time. until around 15 minutes later they hand me the access card to my room.  i think they should hire more people. But overall the staff is really nice and helpful."
"The hotel was clean, the staff very friendly and helpful, the pool was good..
one thing that is annoying is the club next to the hotel which sounds like music until late at night..
but overall we like stay in this hotel and very recommended!"
"I stayed at 2 types of the rooms. Both of them are great!!
Rice Paddy view room: The rice paddy view was so gorgeous. I liked the modern style room that is clean enough and they were using high quality bet sheets. 
The Grand Deluxe  room : was also fantastic! Big room!   AC is  Cool enough. The touch Screen AC controller  is a new style in Bali. I liked it. Bath room  and the bathtub was very comfy.  I liked they have both of the rain shower and another shower that has SPA shower head.  Moreover,  there was another shower on the bathtub. The Sunset time was one of my favorite there. It was very gorgeous. I felt at home.
Everybody who works there are friendly and nice. Ayu who works at the front helped me when I arrived there. She asked me if I need her help everyday. Very kind and pretty. 
Arya and Eka were very friendly and took care of my requests. Eri always cleaned my room perfectly. He is kind too. Erna helped my check out and helped to carry my heavy luggages.  I appreciate all of them and I could stay in Bali safely. I strongly recommend this hotel.   I will come back here soon. Thank you . 
Tarima Kasih"
"I stay at Aveda Boutique 2 or 3 times a year since Covid. The Junior suite Pool View is my favorite room. View is nice, room is clean and bed is comfortable too. I will repeat."
"We would like to say a very big ""Thank You"" for making us feel welcome upon our arrival at Aveda Boutique Hotel, Seminyak, Bali. The hotel is clean and good value for money, very helpful and friendly staff. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Every time we visit Bali, we always stay in this hotel. This hotel is really recommended.

"It’s one of the nicest hotels in Bali.
The staff is super friendly and helpful - the rooms are spacious, clean and miss nothing.
Can highly recommend to stay here"
The way they keep my father's bag bcs he forgot at the lobby is a 100 from me. Everything was perfect except the parking lot. Will definitely back for my next trip.
"We had a 4 nights stay.  Room was upgraded due to extra bed pool view.  Super spacious n clean room n bathroom with big bath tub n in bathroom wardrobe convenience for changing.  Staffs are extremely polite, friendly n helpful.  Breakfast has a variety but not super nice can be improved. Negative point would be hotel on the busiest street of Bali, always jam, a 10 mins drive takes 20 to 30 mins by car.  The dinning for dinner too small area near the road.  Not many prefer to dinner at cafe.  But room dinner service is a thumbs up cheap big portion n room is comfy.  A very enjoyable stay just the traffic is a kick.  Plenty of eateries around too."
"We would like to say a very big ""Thank You"" for making us feel welcome upon our arrival at Aveda Boutique Hotel, Seminyak, Bali.  The hotel is clean and good value for money, very helpful and friendly staff.  We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Every time we visit Bali, we always stay in this hotel.  This hotel is really recommended."
"The location is just perfect, but more than anything the service staff is brilliant! We were both working, and needed good internet due to client calls, and the service staff would send their IT to prioritize our IP! This is unheard of! Brilliant service :) Thank you to all Aveda staff! :)"
"The staff were all very friendly and the room itself was spacious, clean and looked new! Bathrooms were spacious and clean. Did not expect this level of excellence for the cheap price they offer, definitely value for money."
"Value with money for this hotel.
We booked for 2 rooms, asked for connecting room. It's really comfort for us as a family.
The room is okay. Not too big yet not too small. 
The breakfast is so so. Not too many variant. Could add more items.
The location is good. Just asked for the vallet parking if you drive yourself to the hotel."
"We stayed at Aveda in June for 4 nights in the Deluxe Room. Got an amazing deal from Agoda as well. 
The hotel is so conveniently located where the business is centered. Quite a few choices of great foods just across the hotel including Nostimo, Monsieur Spoon, DaMaria, and others. Many convenience stores around and, perhaps most importantly, a laundromat.
The staff were always helpful and kind. The housekeeping always kept our clean clean and tidy, so you can always count on having a good night sleep after a whole day of going out.
The street may get busy and congested, but if you get higher floor rooms or ones at the back, it'll be noise free.
The room was spacious for the price. I fully recommend this hotel for family and or couple travelers."
"The price is very reasonable. I have a balcony in my room with a relieving view. I can just sunbathe in my own room. Spacious enough. The food is very good. Everything; salons, convenience stores, vape stores, bars, and cafes, are just around the corner. You need no vehicles if you're staying here."
I booked for my parents here for 3 nights staying. The place is good and the hotel can give us the good welcome message with the couple swan above the bed. My parents loved it so much!
"Excellent room, nice staffs, decent parking lot for motorcycle and car (eventhough it is kinda steep from basement), and outstanding location. It is very close to famous restaurant and cafes, it is even close to Da Maria (so the sound of busy place is sometimes bothering). The location is kinda like double edged sword. It can be very nice for people who want to explore nearby cafes and restaurants. But for someone who want to travel more far from the hotel (need car or motorcycle) it is kinda need more effort because the road in front of the hotel is usually crowded and jammed."
"The room was spacious, got ref, safety box, hair dryer, basic toiletries, can request to borrow clothes' iron and board and plug adaptor for free, staff were really prompt and attentive with our needs. Breakfast spread was nice! A lot of choices and tastes good! Only thing that needs improvement are the bath towels, they're white and clean but got this smell that we don't like, I suggest to use fabric conditioner. Above all, it was a great stay indeed. Unfortunately, our 4 nights became shortened to 2 nights due to our emergency need to leave and go back due to the corona virus travel restrictions happening now. We'll definitely return and book again!"
"Love everything about Aveda, especially the room and location.
Surely worth the money, located in front of the area of Monseur Spoon Petitenget, a simple walk to Expat and Pison too. Very nice stay!
They provide valet services for your car in case the parking is full."
"The room is large , clean, the best tings is has a balcony facing paddy field …. Relaxing . The food is also good"
"actually i choose this hotel randomly to stay in Bali , but well its turned out very well. 
The cleaness, the staff, the place , the food , the pool is the best .
I stay for 5 day and im very happy . 
I will stay in there again if i go to Bali for sure."
"really have a good stay at aveda. good view, the staff very helpfull, room very clean, location very strategies. will come back for sure"
"One of the best transit hotel, super friendly staff, room service menu is great. This hotel has the most comfortable beds. Car vallet service is great. I stay here often."
"The price compare with the facility is very good deal. Huge room,clean and nice interior. Good cust service only expreience a little bit rude service from one fat guy at front office.
Surround with great restaurant and coffee shop. Downstair restaurant selling yummy meal with good price"
"Nice big clean room with a balcony overlooking the rice paddies nextdoor.
The room was quiet considering being close to a busy road. 
The staff were very friendly & also  assisted me to locate my room. 
There is massage service in house that I highly recommend. I had the traditional 1hr Balinese massage & it was very relaxing.  Thankyou
Also the undercover parking is a bonus. 
Look forward to staying again in the future."
"I got this booking at such a cheap price I never imagined for.
The rooms were great and the view was fascinating.
The reception staff including Satria, Dika and others (I'm sorry I don't have your names) were so friendly and helpful which made my stay very very pleasant.
I'm coming back here again The Aveda.. Missing you all."
I have been stay in this hotel many time. One i remember that all the staf are very helpful specially @Arya (FO) who help me when i have a trouble waiting for the room. He came over and offering me completely voucer cause he knows i have been stay in that hotel many time. Thanks
"The experience is really good. The location is great in Petitenget street. The room was great. It is only the breakfast that is not so good, I mean I expect there will be a buffet but no, there is only an a’la carte, but is okay since it is the effect of the pandemic.
Overall is a great experience to stay there, would love to come there again next time."
"need to change towel, because the color is not bright white anymore..the Air Conditioner is very good in my room, The Club next to the property is loud enough so the music still heard from my room, but overall my stay on this hotel is good."
"I think this is the best hotel ever with the affordable price.. and the hotel is clean, the smells it’s good and the location is verry strategic.. i think, i’ll back for the next trip with this hotel"
"It is so near to the center of night life and day life in Bali. The room is quite big, also the bed is the real king size (200x200). It has balcony and you can enjoy your day even you just stay in the hotel."
"clean hotel, good service, strategic location, rice field view. highly recommend staying at this hotel."
"Best deal via Agoda; strategic location close to all, easy to get food & transport, close to the beach"
"Best place to stay, close to night clubs, bars, coffeeshop and more recommendation places nearby Seminyak and Canggu"
The location is right in the middle of Seminyak. Cafes and restaurants are just walking distance. Staff are nice and room is clean. Every room has a balcony.
Really good place to stay which comes with a lot of facilities in the hotel. The rice terrace besides the hotel was really calming. Great hospitality from the staff.
"Lokasinya strategis, staf ramah, fasilitas lengkap. Cuma 5 menit naik motor buat sunsetan ke pantai Batu Belig. Best!! Couldn't ask for more, thank youuuu agoda, thank you the aveda!! :)"
"Best locations if u want to stay in seminyak around and canggu also, near restaurants and caffe"
Great location with surrounding of cafes and access to the nearest beach 😊
"The guy who checked me in was really helpful, sadly i forgot his name . He was kind enough to upgrade my room. Overall, i would recommend the place for budget price and good quality"
"My room was upgraded to Suite room and romantic decoration for Free, very satisfied during my honeymoon stay , this hotel is perfect for everything, will come visit again next time"
it was a good service hotel with the affordable price
"I stay here for 7 days with hubby and group of friends for holiday and we enjoy it's strategic location. The hotel is nearby some resto, cafe and many other  tourist destinations. The most favorite thing here is having breakfast by the paddy field and the room is spacious.
Our suggestions for the management are:
1. To add more seats & table facing the paddy field, and also to make a good variety of Breakfast menu. 7 days stays in this hotel, the menu is never change...  we found it boring since the variety is also limited.  
2. The corridor to reach our room is too dark/no light at all at night. We stay in a room facing  Restaurant that actually can be reach by elevator, in fact we have to take stairs to get there.
Hope the hotel can improve it all soon to make all the guests feels more comfy,
Thank you!"
"kamar luas, kolam renang bagus, the best hotel"
"i will recommend this hotel to my friends, I was in the junior suite before i move to deluxe paddy room, the room is nice!"
"Overall experience was great. Clean hotel, spacious and location is great."
"Strategic location, friendly staff, clean bedroom, daily housekeeping, cold room, comfortable lobby, thank you Aveda"
"We loved our stay in Aveda. The paddies view are amazing, quietness. The room spacious and clean, pool perfect for hot days to cool down and amazing team. Breakfast has various options. We stayed in superior room 6 days paddy views.well worth it!"
Location is in the center but you'll never guess from the hustle bustle road in front of the hotel when you go inside ur room ur view will be peaceful rice paddies! Recommended to booked the room with rice paddies view in the ground floor:)
"This is my second stay, love the area, close to my favorite place . Monsieur Spoon. 
This time I found an insect  next to my bed. I hope they would clean up better and understood after such long time vacuum.
 good luck"
"Cleanlines and the location is great!
i always comeback to aveda when i travelling in seminyak area. Pool are clean and big, staff are good, ah i love the aveda boutique hotel... Thank youuuu :)"
"Lots of nearby good restaurants and bars.
Less than 30mins from the Airport. Staff are really nice. Be aware that next to the this place there is a bar that usually noisy on the Friday and Sat due to people partying. So if you are sensitive to noise until 2 AM then thing about it. So far, value for money and recommended as the room is huge."
"Relaxing stay, we loved how comfortable was the room and the beautiful green paddies. The breakfast had a lot of option and the pool mostly quiet was nice and cool. Close by many restaurants & shops. We stayed 6 nights!"
"Choosing to stay here cause I like the location, it’s so close with lots of restaurants and amenities. Room is spacious, clean, and same as the photos. The paddy field view is amazing!"
"We loved our stay in Aveda. Booked 2 rooms for a night, I got cheap price from Agoda, turns out this hotel is amazing! The view, the location, the staff, and the room itself is really great! 
We’ll definitely return and book again!"
Strategic location with the good price.
"Aveda hotel is located in Petitenget street, surrounded by nice cafe & resto such as Nook, Pison cafe, Monsieur Spoon (just across the street!), also not far to Canggu area. Supermarket and drug store also are not far, just walking about 5 mins you can find them.
Petitenget street is one of busiest street in Seminyak area, so sometimes there is traffic jam in rush hour. Beach also is not too far, just walking for 10-15 mins to Batu Belig beach. 
I booked Junior Suite room and it was spacious! The bed was king size and also has 1 sofa bed. The amenities was quite complete (except bathrobe) and the soap smell was nice. 
The hotel has small park area, so you can park your car by hotel valet parking (free) or park in Da Maria resto (next to the hotel - free) with permission to the hotel security.  As a note, Da Maria resto sometimes having a party (my experience the party was on Sunday). So the music will be so loud until 2am. But the hotel will give a flyer as an information to all hotel guest about the party and do apologize if the music will bothering. 
Breakfast, it was nice but not special. Just simple Indonesian food and the bakery was so so. Breakfast start at 7am until 10am."
It is indeed a very nice hotel with a spacious room in a strategic location. We had a good time staying here.
"Perfect if you have activities planned in both Seminyak and canggu as it’s in between the two so easy to get to either. 
Air con and rooms were good and clean."
"gak nyesel bermalam disini, harganya udh suer hemat dpet fasilitas mewah, good"
"If you want to stay in a hotel that surrounding with fancy and delicate restaurants, you have to consider this property. If you are lucky they will upgraded your room with paddy field with stunning scenery of Bali. The room was tidy but the AC was cold. Everything is good! Thanks Aveda!"
"Great price for such a prime location! Enjoyed our stay, it was quiet almost of time but even with the party at the next door club, they did prepare a notice to inform us of that."
"Strategic location, streets full of recommended cafes and restos. You can reach the place nearby by walk."
There is a mart close to the hotel. Room is comfortable and spacious. Will definitely recommend this hotel.
"Big room & bed room, nice view rice field & great sunrise view"
"The room & bath room space amazing, very clean, air conditioner very good, the location fantastic. The towel must change with new one"
"Very nice hotel with a pool, restaurant at the front & clean comfy rooms. Very large bed which was nice after a long flight. Our room had a nice little balcony for the evenings. Friendly staff."
"Hotel nya mudah di jangkau, makanan enak, akses kemanapun dekat"
Best hotel and clean cheap the area is good
"Quite place, comfy and clean! Super reccomended!"
"Great location between Seminyak and Canggu esp. if you have a scooter and are mobile. Spacious and clean rooms, the padi view room top floor in the back was super quiet with a lovely terrace from which you can see Uluwatu and Mount Agung on a clear day. Breakfast is limited but alright. Staff are very helpful."
Best place and staff very nice
"If you want to have place that nearby to everything, this one for you.  So many restaurants nearby and also night club, it just only walking distance, and also not that far from beach just 10-15 minutes walking.
However, the noise from the pub/nightclub in the neighbourhood is so annoying because we still can hear it until late and it’s so loud. For people who want to have night life and party this one is best for you, but for people who want to have calmness please find other hoter 😊😌"
"During this pandemic, me and my friends spend almost 2 weeks at Aveda. the view from our room, especially in the morning is really beautiful with the sunrise and paddy field below. will definitely come back there again."
Very nice staff and comfort place to stay.
Great staff great quite rooms with balcony
"I recommend to take room with rice paddy view . Great hotel for its price , location is good"
"I was here for a holiday/work from home-away-from-home trip, and I really enjoyed it. The gym was too small but the 10-meter pool was pretty ok to get a work out in (you just have to make many laps). The staff were super friendly, and the room was small but cozy with a really nice working station, and a lovely balcony facing the paddy fields - which was a great place to work from while not feeling like you're at work. I still got my tan while meeting my deadline. Will definitely come back one day."
"The Aveda is close to some of the best cafes and restaurants Pettitenget has on offer and a short walk or ride to Seminyak 
Great value for money and the staff were responsive and a pleasure to deal with . The premises are showing age however the pool is great and the rooms are immaculately clean"
Best value hotel!
"Located at the heart of Petitenget area, this hotel provide me a nice stay with a great friendly staff. Convenient stire just accros the street, walking distance beach and plenty of nice place to try around. Will try the paddy room view next time."
"Well maintained, friendly staff and nice room!"
"love this hotel, staff are super nice, good value and the room spacious"
all good package in one deal
Value for money
"Best part: Inexpensive food, beverages and drinks from a small menu. The spa was good with a great deal that I got. Amazing place to stay on a moderate budget."
"Lokasinya bagus, kamar bersih, pelayanannya bagus, def will come back!"
Booked for my family and they enjoyed their stay with room overseeing the paddy field. They ordered a lot of room services cause the food was very good. Breakfast couldve been better. The restaurant feels like an open space without any fan or AC.
The place so peaceful and especially the pool so clean and the water was cold. Will be back next time.
"very recommended , stayed few times here and always feel satisfied. 
thank you. will come back again next time to bali. cheers"
Had a great stay here. Location was great. The staff were so friendly.
"Choose the paddy rice field room on the top floor, and you'll get a very great stay experience in Seminyak. Room is clean with good interior. Gym only has 3 equipments, pool not too spacious. Location very very great. Overall great!"
"The staff are friendly and helpful.
The rooms are clean and tidy. However, some noise may be experienced from the adjacent club when there is an event.
The hallways are too dark. Some common areas appear dark and deserted.
Breakfast is okay. Espresso-based coffee is available with extra charge"
"very satisfied, thank you aveda"
"Clean, room design quality, staff, facility, surrounding area, all are perfect for us like our own home sweet home."
"This hotel is located at a very strategic location.
Definitely recommended!"
"This hotel has spacious rooms, and the junior suite has a lounger and a sofa bed….and i love that the rooms has balcony so we could get fresh air and a place to smoke😁. But you must be patient for the loud noise that comes from the resto/bar(?) beside the hotel when the have events…the loud noise will kinda annoy you…
But overall, i like this hotel…"
"Cozy place, friendly staff and close to the fave greek resto in petitenget."
"Perfect location , surrounded by great restaurants . Central Locationto Seminyak and Canggu . Very helpfull staff. The Paddy View is the highlight ."
all of the hotel components are working well and nice.
"kind of hesitant about the place, at the beginning but turns out, definitely will recommend it to my friends and families. definitely must pick the paddy view for a better, instagramable mood. A less pleasant experience is just the breakfast moment that doesn't serve buffet style. But this is understandably forgiven because of the pandemic situation."
Nice location and nice paddy field
"good place, nice and clean"
"Besides the heavy traffic, this hotel is worth staying for a few nights. The noise from the nearby club didnt bother me much as much as the traffic. Staff went overboard with their services. Nice buffet on the first day, the rest was just ok."
"remote ac from room sometimes is locked by hotel, have to confirm many times to unlock remote"
"The hotel is great! Surrounded by restaurants and cafes at busy Petitenget Area. Right next to the hotel, there is a bar which perform DJ every Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, but the sound don’t bothering much as our baby is just sleeping, also the staff hotel informed well beforehand when we’re checking in, makes us more prepare to the Dj’s coming"
"Everything's was amazing, it’s my forth times coming back since 2020 and it could be 5 stars review but some of the staff not wearing mask during this pandemic, a bit unfortunate but I appreciate to staff that wear mask to meet their customer…
Aveda you can improve your room cleaner staffs, because they were not using mask while coughing and handed towel"
"this hotel has great deals such as great location and nice view, would love to come back later"
"As long as you don't expect miracles for the relatively cheap price, it's a great hotel breakfast was ok could have done with a few more choices. Other than that I would highly recommend."
Very enjoyable stay as the room is spacious and location is great. Very easy access to many cafes and restaurant. The location is more lively compared other places.
"This hotel have a good location, the staff really nice and helpfull.
For breakfast not much menu but more than enough."
"This is my second time to stay here. Always satisfied with everything. Love the paddy fields view from the balcony. The staff was superb, helpful and nice. Keep it up!"
"excellent service, nice and spacious room"
"Very nice place, nice staff and location, i had to leave earlier but this was a very nice place to stay in, would highly recommend"
All is good
Nice place for stay around Petitenget
Thank you for accommodating my request.
