"in the middle of petitenget street, near potato head beach club, mano, and other beach club. many good restaurants too around this hotel such as si jin, rayjin and many more. if you enjoy seminyak night life you will like this hotel, next to this hotel is mirror and shishi is just few steps.
got this hotel at good deals from agoda, and it was worth. they have nice lobby, and swimming pool. the room is big enough, the bed was really big and comfortable. bathroom and bedroom was clean. the staff was polite and helpful. good hotel in the middle of seminyak"

"The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  The only things to be aware of is traffic but there is great restaurants that can easily walk to for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I recommend this place if you don't plan to wander further away from the hotel."
"Very good atmosphere and nice swimming pool , thank you for the great and yummmy breakfast in the rooftop 🙏🏻"
This was a very nice stay.  The location is good.  Good restaurants and bars surrounding the property.  The beach is a short motorcycle ride away.  The facility is clean and the staff is excellent.  Only downside is the water in our room did not get hot so acouple times we elected to shower in the men's locker room in the rooftop gym.
"big bed, great deal, clean, good area, have bath tub, the spa are great."
Nice and competitive price hotel at Seminyak. Pettitenget beach is at  walking distance
"it was an amazing stay.location was great.minor issue was the basement seawage issue on the day we were there.the smell was rotten bad.it transmitted into the lift and made it reaally unpleasent.
me and my husband had the best time in the room and pools.welcoming drink was tasty.minor issue were the edges in the bathtub could be cleaner.but this are too minor compared to the great stay.thank you."
"We loved everything. Highlights were the amazing staff, the beautiful pool and gardens, happy hours at the pool bar and the buffet which was delicious every day. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean and the location was perfect for us."
"We rebooked to stay in this hotel more than 4times already, because we love the room design, the cleanliness, how the hotel manages to keep everything proper and clean.. they upgraded our room to suite even 2 times.. that’s cool.
We surely will come back to this hotel anytime we revisit Bali!!! Totally recommended!"
"Everything is 5 star about this place. The only problem I have is there’s a club next door that plays music loudly til 4-5AM that I can hear in my room. If you cared abt such things, this is not a place for you. If you didnt, you’d be very happy staying here."
"I Am stay this hotel  more than 2weeks ...the reason make me stay here is :room r very clean ..and the service is great !staffs here  try to make the best they can to make u happy ,and I would say ;they succeed..enjoy much ..will come bAck again in  the future ..thank you for everything!"
Beautiful cozy hotel at Seminyak..near to everything..Hotel also Muslim friendly as they didn’t sell pork..Toilet with bidet and also have prayer room
Great place . Big bed . Super clean . Loved it
"We got our room upgraded to a suite deluxe and what a great chance we have !!
The room is amazing with a pool view and a nice balcony. It is also spacious with a minibar and a big bathroom. The staffs are super nice too. I and my partner enjoyed our stay. Will definitely come back for sure."
"Nice hotel, clean almost walkable to other popular dining ard seminyak."
We got Junior suites room on arrival. Surprise!.. It's good to be a part of regular customer. Thank u.
The room was very big and I loved feeling like I was walking around in a jungle with all the greenery. The staff was very kind and helpful with whatever I needed. Would certainly stay here again.
"stayed there for two days with my pregnant wife and the gave us free upgrade, that was so nice, hotel is clean, staffs are great and helpful.. highly recommended"
"everything's great! 
Location, facilities & spa!! 👍🏼👍🏼"
"Our second stay in a year, such great value for money had a massive room overlooking the pool. Great staff, Diah was very welcoming to the kids and always remembered our names. Pool is great especially the kids waterslide. Great restaurants, cafes and attractions so close by. Will see you again soon Jambuluwuk!"
I've been to Bali more times than I can count and Jambuluwuk Oceano has been near the top of my list for best places to stay in Bali. Highly recommended.
So many GREAT recreational spaces PLUS a clinic on premises was the best part as i went up to the Uluwatu temple and unfortunately got scratched by a monkey !!! Came back to the hotel and tgey had a Doc come visit me within 30 mins for my Rabies Vaccines!!! Exceptional service!!
"Extended my stay there as it was so comfortable and convenient. Excellent location, rooftop pool and massage services."
"Everything were exceptional. The hotel is gorgeous, in the heart of seminyak, cool area. Did not take the breakfast so no comment. But the spa was awesome! All value for money, definitely will comeback."
"We found this hotel to be perfect for us. Location wise, we were on the end of the Seminyak restaurants, so we’re able to stroll down to all the different eateries at our leisure, whilst not being in the thick of it. We found the staff to be lovely, friendly and accommodating. Breakfasts were good, and the pools were very inviting. I did wake up a couple times during the night and could faintly hear the music from the club next door, but it wasn’t loud enough to disturb my sleep at all. My husband is a very light sleeper and he wasn’t woken by it at all. 
We had a wonderful stay and would gladly return here."
"Good facilities, nice staff  and best location."
"Nice place, nice location, near to local food resto and near to beach also..so love this hotel location"
"The hotel was operating in smaller capacity during my stay in April 2021, which is ideal if you're looking for a quiet stay. I got breakfast during the stay but I must admit that you can get better choices outside the hotel. At least you'll get fresh brewed coffee, while here, they used instant coffee. The staffs were attentive enough, though they forgot to offer me bottled water in my first two nights (and I am such a fool for not asking)"
"We loved everything about this hotel the location, the service, the staff they were so kind and understanding my children loved the pool and the kids club."
"its very comfort here, very recommend."
"Hotel was neat and clean. A bit old but the bed was super comfortable. 
The spa upstairs was amazing"
"Everything good ..clean ,room big ,will stay again"
"This was amazing experience ever to be here, very comfortable, very complete for the amenities kit, even the breakfast was good!!"
Great hotel and fantastic ambiance. Location also good. Only problem was room service closes at 10.
Children love playing in the pool
such a nice location to anywhere.. im loving it
Staff is friendly. Nice lobby.
Midnight quite noisy because mirror beside and many club around
"My fiance and I stayed here for the majority of our time in Bali coming from Sydney, Australia. Jambuluwuk is very central to lots of restaurants, cafes and bars. The slide into the pool is truly unique and fun and there were hardly any people using it - so we almost had it to ourselves! It might not be nice if your room is lower down, because then you would be overlooking the pool directly and get some noise/privacy issues. The room was clean. The staff are friendly and always wish you well but they don't go over the top with service (there are some English barriers with the staff but that's to be expected when travelling). For the price we paid I thought that this place was good value for money. There was a leak in the lobby roof while we stayed (from rain) but that wasn't an issue for us. The rooftop pool is great too - although note that the welcome drink is not alcoholic :( Skip the breakfast - there are far cheaper and tastier alternatives just outside the doors."
good 🫶🏻
"Price point wise it's a good value.
However if you are someone that like the beach, then it's a little walk from the hotel., like 15 minutes walk.
Restaurants around here are all westernized so you can't really find traditional local food. Everything else is good. Pool is nice. Did not use other facilities."
Everything was excellent!
"Pros ;
- Great location avoid some traffic from Centre Seminyak area
- surround with great restaurant and cafe
- friendly staff and helpful 
- standard room type and facilities 
Con
- towel a little bit too old 
- small towel should be provide 
Overall it’s good!!"
menyenagkan
"Only downside is the club next door, everything else is superb"
"This hotel has two beautiful pools and is located next to several high end nightclubs, many restaurants, and beautiful beaches in the petitenget area of Seminyak.  The staff are youthful and enthusiastic.  They aim to please, though the food needs some improvement.  The spa services are excellent and the childcare facilities are impressive."
"Nice friendly staff, really good pools and view from the rooftop. Clean and spacious rooms"
Very nice hotel .. stay here for 5 days.. the bed is spacious love it.. the staff is friendly.. only the toilet need to do something.. the shower water pressure is very low and the toilet lil bit dirty.. maybe will stay here again when im in seminyak again
"Hotel location in the middle of seminyak, which is surrounded by many restaurants"
"This place is a comfortable accommodation but it's very dusty. Staff is very nice, helpful & friendly. Easily accessible."
"The Hotel is convenient for party people, it just right beside Mirror Clubbing House. U can get nearest Minimart also. It slightly hard to get food after 11pm as u need to walk around to go for 24hrs eating place. The only food place that Is nice is Lovster Shop which is 24Hrs"
"Value for money hotel. It’s probably a 3.5 stars hotel if I have to rank it. 
The lows, hotel is quite old but decently maintained though some revamp should be considered. On the second day of my stay, the casing of the ceiling light just right above the bath tub, dropped and shattered into pieces .. I can’t imagine if I was in the shower. The shower head and water pressure is really bad.. water flows out like from a bottle spray… weak and mist like 
The gym is really old with some of the machine not working properly..
Breakfast option is over the top with a big range of food option but food is quite bad to be honest. I totally appreciate the effort of giving so much to travelers but I think quality beats quantity anytime! 
Big kudos to the staff though! That I give a perfect 10 for everyone of them. Very helpful , hospitable and friendly. 
Not sure if I ll head back again .. but if u want just a no frills and value for money stay.. this could work!"
"Location is good close to the restaurant and bars ,."
"Very nice room, near mirror club"
"Will recommend all! Great hotel very clean and all the staff are friendly and courtesy. Check in hotel at night the aircon not cold and theres leaking in the room next to the bed, immediately they transfer us to another room (fast service)."
"This hotel has pros and cons.
pros- hotel staffs right from the reception, house keeping and restaurants, they provide great service, friendly and accommodating. 
Cons- rooms are overpriced, rooms are dark and no enough sunlight. Renovations underway so most of the facilities were not available, noisy air-con. Adjacent to the hotel there is a nightclub where the music pumps non-stop during the night where you wont be able to get good sleep.
Overall not a satisfactory stay for the price you pay for the rooms."
Breakfast not so good
"Location is awesome, walking distance to the beach, shops, and restaurants. Need to pay attention on cleaness. The first room we got was dusty, zero anemity and waterless. Thankfully, the hotel gave us another room."
need more staff to work here
"I would advise to get the cleaner to clean the bathroom well . 
Shower heads not properly clean as the water making a lot of mess as the water coming out shooting all over the place. Mildew on the tub and basin. Toilet stains .. the rest are fine except the toilet"
"Had issues telephone, fridge, tv and toilet bidet. Fridge took several days to get fixed.
Telephone did not work properly and took several visits to fix. Bidet spray never worked.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Breakfast menu was not the best. Great rooftop pool and restaurant, but rooftop needs renovations."
Good room and bathroom like the swimming oool
"Booked this hotel for our last nights stay in Bali. Located in Seminyak. Location wasn’t too bad, pretty close to central Seminyak. Hotel was rated 5 stars, but aside from the lobby, it was probably more like a 3-4 star. Bathroom had mould all around the bath, and the base of the bath had some sort of scum on it. Wall behind bath/shower leaked quite a lot  into the bedroom, and staff had to come and repair at 10:00pm at night. Hotel is quite run down. Lobby and pool area were very nice. Gym was very basic with all treadmills not working. Staff were very hospitable and helpful."
Like the location in seminyak Have Everything  around u
"Hotel and the facilities were great, with a rooftop pool and ground floor pool and pool bars offering a relaxing time. The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfy. However, upon arriving into our rooms, the tv was not working, the shower was broken and the fridge was warm. This was fixed when we reported these issues. There was also a promotional offer for laundry services which we used, however upon paying for the laundry, we weren’t able to get the promotional offer because we specifically didn’t ask that this offer was to be applied. We were not told that this was what we had to do. So Laundry was very expensive! Rooms also had thin walls so was able to hear housekeeping, people walking down hallway and people in the next room. Also couldn’t sleep in as housekeeping was early. The rooms had a great view of Seminyak and a view of the sunrising in the mornings. The staff were very friendly and helpful and offered great places for restaurants for authentic Indonesian cuisines."
Fasilitas hotel ok.. kebersihan ok.. staf ramah2.. cuman sayang lokasinya sempit dan parkirnya susah.. so far menyenangkan
"Great pool , Comfortable bed"
"The fridge didnt work, 
there are no hair dryer nor Iron board In the room, 
WIFI not so good
the phone line was annoying with all the noisy sound, 
On weekend (at night) the Music from the roof top was Very Loud"
"- THE HOT WATER WAS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL, no hot water running, i had to shower with cold water luckily it was just for a night. the room is quite small and a bit dim, the wifi connection was not really good through the end corner room. AND THE AMENITIES WAS REALLY LESS for a hotel like this.
+ aircon works well, valet parking"
Little bit disappointed when I moved to this hotel because the water in the closet can’t stop. The hot water was not come out.  I had to wait the maintanance till night.
"Pros: 
very comfortable bed and great pillows. 
Good breakfast
Very central
Clean rooms
Cons:
Ground floor pool gets no sun, so not really a place to lay by the pool.
The roof top pool is only small and is ok, but gets very windy. 
Not hotels fault but the streets very hard to walk around with kids there many cars parked on footpaths. Not the sort of hotel you would book if you want a resort and lay by the pool holiday."
"This is one of the best hotels in simyak . 
Friday Sttaf  nice swimming pool"
"Only sleep for the first night, checked out the next day morning, situated next to club and we can hear the loud music. I didn't check the review, pictures look nice, they need to do more on upkeep on the property. level 2 and level 3 was closed for renovation as per staff.  Staff was helpful and offered to change room but we really cannot sleep with the loud music. Hotel Manager WA me to utilise the next visit to bali, but we rather not request for any refund."
"This is not a 5 star hotel. It’s dated, worn out and a bit grotty. 
There is a nightclub next door that booms music through the courtyard until all hours of the morning. Even with ear plugs the thumping music was still audible. 
The hotel photos are generally very flattering compared with reality. 
To be fair the staff were friendly and the bar downstairs was nice with good music and decent food. But I wouldn’t stay again."
"Cleanliness: Not sure why the room was dusty and had hairs around the room, on the bed, balcony and bathroom upon check-in. 
Location: Where Jambuluwuk is located, getting there is really time consuming. Same goes when trying to exit. Very heavy traffic on both directions that getting to Bali Galeria Mall took almost 1hr in view the distance is almost 6km only."
"My experience last stay. 
Maybe because i booked only superior room. 
My request has confirmed by staff prior my arrival in Bali. Then no responded when they did nothing on my request. 
Gym written open from 7, then i've called the reception to open the gym. They said have to. Make appointment before. 
Then wait for 20 min until staff coming."
"The location of the hotel is great, and it is near to many cafes. Cleanliness of the place could have been improved but overall, pleasant stay."
"I dont know how this hotel got 5 star, all the furnitures are old.. Overall its ok"
Not what’s promised service appalling
"Huge delays when ordering things, multiple orders wrong. Requested on 3 separate occasions for room to be changed. Night club next door extremely noisy from late at night until early hours of the morning"
"My husband and I stayed here 4 nights. The rooms require some cleaning and you need to request for facilities like hair dryers, water etc. Also the deluxe rooms have showers in the bathtub that you need to jump in and out of. The staff are friendly but do not take initiative to explain the facilities when you check in."
"Disappointed, we stayed here for 5 nights. It right next to a club so we had to move room due to keeping us up till 3am. There was no hot water when we stayed and the fridge didn’t work, there is also building site next to the spa so you can’t relax and hotel needs a revamp. The staff were very welcoming though."
Next door to a club so there is very loud music until 3am and you cant sleep. Hotel is ok. I would look elsewhere.
"Hotel has a decent location and spacious rooms, but it is not well maintained. Bathroom is not clean, bathtub is disgusting, towels are dirty. Facilities are not well kept, windows and roof is leaking when raining...would not come again."
"I never review hotels but was keen to paint an accurate picture of this one as the photos certainly don’t look like the reality.
It’s not the cleanest of hotels and is very very tired - More like a 3 star than a 4 star. The pool area is shaded all day unlike the images suggest and the rooftop pool has no umbrellas or any shade making it impossible use in the strong sun.
The F&B was very average and the worst think is that it is situated right next door to a nightclub which pumps out heavy bass tracks from 11pm until 5am everyday so very difficult to sleep.
The staff were the only saving grace and tried to deal with any issue quickly.
There are much better 4 star hotels in the area."
Room are not clean
"The room was small but comfortable. The area was great as we didn't mind the noise and it is close to Potato head. 
The pictures of the pools were not like what we were faced with. This is in no way a 5* hotel, the amenities were not up to par and the downstairs pool was green with Alge. There were no cabanas and one sun bed- completely not what it showed in the pics. 
The upstairs pool was better with more sunbeds but nothing like the pictures. 
The bathroom in the room was dirty and we requested it to be cleaned but nothing was done. 
Okay for young travellers who will be out partying but not for anyone else."
The fridge didnt work while we need cold water so much
For the price this is a great option for staying in Seminyak!
"It’s a decent walk to eat street, the bathroom was dirty and the shower was terrible, the water went all different directions from the shower head, the water pressure was poor. The pool on the roof is half the size in real life compared to the photos, the pool downstairs has a waterslide"
"Too expensive for what is it.
Shower was very bad,location is ok"
Hotel looks aged and tired. Corridors were dusty and lacking any life. Breakfast was an easy miss. Some rooms near the pool were ok but anything else should be a hard No. Staff was incredibly friendly and eager to help
This hotel can’t be 5 star hotel. From the very first check in I was shocked because all I was told warnings ( if you smoke inside the room if you damage if…..) instead of mentioning if I need help I can contact them.  The room is pretty small and dark. The fridge wasn’t working and also there was no kittle tea or coffee. They have no signs to put on door to say do not disturb while I was sleeping the cleaners keep knocking the door as early as 10 am  and I told them please let me sleep as I had a big night out they came back 3 times knocking my door and this was happening everyday. I believe this hotel management did not train train their staff very well and the hotel I would say is 3 Stars hotel
"Staff was lovely, but the room wasn't clean. I booked here so that I could use the fitness centre and it was closed.  The bath towels looked old and stained, and there were no hand/face towels. Two of the light bulbs were out.  There were ants on the floor in the bedroom. The water from the faucet and the shower had an odor.  I only stayed for one night, but I would not come back again."
"We were given alternative rooms that were slightly bigger but were also dirty, and in poor condition. Rooftop pool and lower ground floor pools were nice. Spa treatment offers were also good."
"Paid for an upgrade, we were given a room with air conditioning not working. Request to change the room but instead they sent someone to fix it. Air conditioning was still leaking after the fix. Staff was not helpful with changing rooms again. On the last day we had a night flight and needed an extension, the receptionist was giving us different prices for extension. Will never come back again."
"It is not a 5 star hotel,  the bathroom has a lot of mould and dirty for a five star hotel, it is more likely a 3 star hotel  the bed sheet and pillow case are smelly and we have to ask reception staff to replace the sheet and pillow case, the room also small with little facilities. 
The television also not working, so we have to move to another room. 
It's not what we expected for a 5 star hotel,  it can misleading,  and  you will not get what you should have at five star hotel."
"The property is run down nd it has lots of issue. 
The cleaning is a big issue. 
The bathroom not functioning properly is also a issue.  
I think they need to improve a lot"
"Right next to a night club and could bearly sleep with the noise. Rooms weren't clean, hot water in the shower didn't work as well as the air con. Had to have the fan on which didn't help much.  When i complained i got moved to another room with its own problems. The kids club is more catered for small kids. My son who is 8 found it very boring.  Staff could not speak English and ordering from the swim up bar was difficult. Would not recommend this hotel."
very noisy from the AC outdoor machine
So many things wrong with facilities. Frustrating place to stay
NOT RECCOMENDED
I cam to see this hotel for their gym and it was close. The excuse of covid is ridiculous as all hotels have been left gym open. Why not tell me before check-in and I will have cancelled
"The hotel is really beautiful, the room are very large, the bed very confortable and large also. My son and I we went to the kids club, we both love it. We’ve kinda stay 2hrs after visiting around by walk to the Seminyak square and the shop around. From the hotel you can walk like 15/20 mins by walk, which was nice as you can discover things on the way to shopping area( no regret) I will definitely stay at jambuluwuk hotel in Seminyak again for our next trip to Bali. Recommendation for a nice restaurant ( little Ingka ) this restaurant it’s like 5/8 mins walk to the left of the hotel. It’s  a very nice restaurant, nice design, with tropical vegetation. I went there very day for breakfast and lunch also. You won’t regret. Totally recommend jambuluwuk oceano hotel."
"We had a beautiful and spacious junior suite. I requested for our room to be decorated for my partners birthday and they did an amazing job, my partner loved it 😊 would definitely recommend jambuluwuk oceano seminyak . Also the breakfast buffet was amazing, so much to chose from"
"Well Jambuluwuk Seminyak is one of the hotel that I like in Bali. The price isn’t that expensive but the room is good. I stayed in Deluxe room which is bigger (there are some deluxe room which are bigger than another deluxe room) and i love the bed.
The area itself is strategic because it is surrounded with cafe, mini-market and club such as Mirror, Bar di Bali etc. One thing that need improvement is the breakfast food because the menu is so standard and never change. But overall this hotel is 4/5 and it’s good"
Loved everything about this place. From the buffet breakfast to the location and cleanliness. Not to mention the friendly staff and the dayspa services. I just can't fault this place. Thanks for a wonderful stay Jambuluwuk Oceano! Highly recommended :)
"Loved my stay at Jambuluwuk! It's close to all the hip restaurants and attractions Seminyak has to offer (Potato Head, Mexicola, etc.) but also far enough from the busy side of the city. The beds are very comfortable and the A/C was perfect. The only two complaints I would have is that the walls are so thin that neighbors can hear you talking on the phone (and my attention was called for this several times) and that the shower head is quite messy so bathroom floor gets wet! Just be careful! Overall - cute interiors and very nice hotel to stay in. Staff were very helpful and gave me assistance whenever I needed it."
"We encounter a Cheating incident when we change USD$1000 for IDR13.9 Juta.  We counted couple of times each but on arrival back to hotel, we discovered shortchange of IDR 3 Juta. We called Front Desk. Gong Ayu for assistance in reporting to the Police. She advised us to speak to Hotel Security for best action to be taken. Security informed us will sent Hotel Staff, Dharmaputra to accompany us back to Money Changer to get back the IDR 3 Juta that we were shortchanged. Long story short, Dharmaputra was excellent and acted beyond his service requirements. He convinced the Money Changer to give us back the full IDR 3 Juta. We were very happy with the Hotel Staff for being friendly, courteous plus acted beyond the service to help us recover the money. A stranger in a Foreign Country and these Balinese shown us the Better side of their island minus the small incident of cheating. Travellers have to beware but always can count on the Hotel especially Jambuluwuk to extend a big helping hand."
"I loved the location of his hotel as it was convenient for everyone for our family of 5, even walking distance to seminyak beach . We had two small children 4&6 and they enjoyed the playroom which was free for staying guests . The pool was great too as they had a slide . Wish we stayed longer at this hotel as we only stayed 3 nights . Will book this hotel again in the future . Staff were friendly too. Cons : the lobby is airy so you will get some bugs here and there which is normal in Bali  so just make sure you keep the door shut so they don’t enter the room. Other than that everything was perfect !"
"The location of the hotel is great, right in the heart of Seminyak. Hotel lobby, reception, swimming pools and restaurants are all clean, modern, spacious and beautiful. The room was nice (I had a deluxe with balcony room). However, the bathroom looked nice but their were stains on the floor and mood in the corners of the bathtub. Also the water in the sink drained very slow and the various shower options and waterstrenght were far from ideal. I  could turn the tab to the shower and instead of water coming out of the shower it came out of the bathtub tab. Also the water was never really warm. Balcony was nice and so was the bed and seating area. There is also no closet to put your clothes in (other than 4 hangers) ther are no shelves or anything. Roomstewards were great and so was the reception staff. Overall a great experience, however the bathroom is in need of some maintenance."
"If you are looking for a good price well located place to stay in seminyak look no further from the manager down you are well looked after
Very clean and close to lovely restaurants 
This is our fifth stay her and frankly for the price and service we give the Jambuluwuk 100% thank you again to all the staff that made our holiday fantastic"
"I booked this room last minute for a great deal. 
The room was quite spacious, and the bathroom was quite a luxurious standard. They placed me in room 004, which was all the way down the bottom floor swimming pool. 
I really enjoyed the swimming pool as well, it was quite large and refreshing.
The hotel is located in the less crowded part of Seminyak, around 10-15 minutes away from the Petitenget beach. It’s also surrounded by many mini markets, restaurants, even beach clubs (potato head).
The only downside is that the room was quite dark, because the large window I had was facing a wall. But as long as the sun shine can come trough (albeit a bit dim), I’m not complaining.
It is indeed located next to Mirror, the club, but I thought it was quite a quiet night, you can sometimes feel the bass thumping from next door, but from my room, I couldn’t really hear the loud noise.
I would stay here again!"
"I got an upgrade rooms from the hotel, thanks a lot Jambuluwuk! Spacious room with huge bed and pillows. The hotel also has lots of facilities such as playground for kids, gym, 2kind of swimming pool, shop, bar,etc... the thing is the pool (at LG floor) has very cold water,kids will be freezing. Last, the food! They should improve the taste of their food and make more variation for the breakfast food"
"Great facilities such as two seperate pools with beautiful features and a jacuzzi, great quality gym with awesome equipment with a hammer and plunge pool for recovery, on site spa, and seperate common spaces to snuggle on a couch with a book or work away, located in between beautiful restaurants, great coffee and juice bars, organic places, gyms, bars, It is in the centre of Seminyak between the two major ends of Seminyak making access left or right exciting, close to the beach, potato head, mrs sippy etc. I have travelled in many places and the bedding is so so so comfy!!!! can't get enough of the comforts in the room! only one downside is the showers a bit off in our standard room, but everything else makes up for it. Would highly recommend!!!!"
"A great 4 star hotel at seminyak area. Easy to find. Near everywhere, and yes, just 1 minute to reach the famous japanese food. The hotel is big enough with great swimming pool, children playground, big room.
What I like here is the swimming pool and the location. 
The staff very polite. My towel accidentaly get wet,and just in minute they give us a new one. Security also good, parking for car is limited, for motorcycle is enough.
What I don't like, the bidet shower is dirty. You should change that. 
Otherwise, it's very great staying here."
the room was big enough for 4 of us. we stay in superior king with big bedroom. my kids so fun stay at jambuluwuk. will be back for sure if go to bali next time. 😊
"Jambuluwuk near to A lot of famous location in Seminyak. just 5minutes walking to Potato Head, W, Biku cafe, Mrs Sippy, etc."
"Got this place due to its affordable rate which includes amenities like pools and kids club and good breakfast.  Location is about 2km walk to Seminyak Square.  But I guess thats minor issue as you can always take grab at a very cheap price. They also have bicycle for rent if you are adventurous but I must say the bumpy roads and traffic are quite challenging.
Surrounded by cafes, clubs, spa. I went to a spa just 1min walk which is very convenient.
Breakfast spread was above expectation. From american breakfast to local dishes.  Live stations like egg, waffles, bakso.
Clean pool but the one at the LG was abit too cold and the slide is open for kids (about 5yo above) only. Roof top pool is just beside the breakfast area so you can go take a dip after breakfast. Bedroom was clean and big. Toilet has bidet and complete w toiletries. There's bath tub but it water wasnt draining properly. And the cleanliness for bath tub need improvement. Molds visible. Overall it was an excellent stay."
