"I had a villa and it was just stunning the gardens and beautiful and the hotel is spectacular. There was so much to do and golf carts to pick you up and drive you around or deliver room service.  I had a bad cold and the staff delivered things to my room and were so helpful, thank you for beautiful stay here"
"This hotel far exceeded our expectations. The staff was extremely professional and kind. The food was absolutely amazing, the spa and the sunrise yoga classes were our favourite. I highly recommend this resort and hope we get to stay there again next time we come to Bali. I was really sad to leave."
"Our jaws dropped the second we walked in. The staff here are so friendly, helpful and go out of their way. The view is to die for. Our valley view pool villa was just perfect. We enjoyed yoga, utilised the shuttle bus in and out of Ubud each day and soaked up those views. Breakfast was delicious. I would highly recommend this resort and would love to return. Thank you to all the wonderful staff 😘🤩"
"One of the best hotels i’ve ever been in my life. The best part was the staff who were amazing and super sweet. Other than that the location was amazing, the hotel very clean, and the food excellent. The pools and jacuzzis are an instagram dream. Would recommend any day any traveller to come here"
"I really enjoyed my 1 night stay here, and if I had more time, I'd extend my stay but work comes first. Here are the list of my fav things on the resort.
1. The Pool - Their pool is OUTSTANDING. 3 Stories Infinity Pool are so good, you'll get a bunch of good spots / pics here. I spent most of the time in this pool.
2. Yoga Pavilion - It's as good as the pictures. I came late and it's over, doesn't stop you from taking great photos here
3. Food - The breakfast is really good. Selection of Juice, Bread Basket, Healthy Openers (Salad / Granola / other healthy food),  and main course. There are no buffet currently but im pretty sure most people will feel full.
4. Staffs are super good and attentive. They'll help you with Valet / Taking pics etc at good speed
5. The room - pretty good. It's not the best I've been but definitely deserves the 5 stars
All in all, I have 0 regrets staying here and will return in the future"
"We had an excellent stay and wish we could have stayed for longer…. Maybe another time and hope the quality remains at the sky high the next time too.. everything except the size of the individual beds (in twin bed configuration ) was perfect.. they had vegetarian food options.. there was a temperature controlled jacuzzi available.. rooms were clean, service was impeccable.. the location is a bit far from other places in Bali but for someone wanting to explore Ubud, this is a great place to stay.."
"Impressed by the service! Staff are very friendly, informative and attentive. You'll feel like a queen there. Room is clean and spacious with a very beautiful view! Since it's on east side, you can see a sunrise. The Resort itself is huge with 3-tier pools and there's a yoga place with amazing view as well. You can get a lot of nice photos all around. There are many activities you can join. Oh, last thing, the foods are great, too! Only need to be careful of insects/bugs at night."
"If you're looking for a tranquil stay far away from the Bali hustle and bustle, this ticks off all the boxes. Breakfast was just exceptional. Staff will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and the view of the lush greenery is absolutely breathtaking. Will definitely return to this resort."
"I didn't expect that i will have the greatest stay in this hotel, beyond my expectation
I love this hotel, they have the best pools, gym and other facilities. They offer many activities, morning yoga, morning walk, spa etc
The room is very spacious, neat and the view was amazing
I had breakfast and dinner here, and it was satisfying, and we got a Balinese dance entertainment while dinner or saturday night, love love love
The hospitalities was uh-mazing, all the staffs were very friendly and helpful
Currently my top 3 hotel ❤️, we'll be back for sure"
"This is a top notch hotel. You have everything you need, plus more. From the design of the hotel to the friendliness of staff, facilities, view of the valley, food, packages/promotions, communication, room service - everything is of an extremely high standard. Since the first night we arrived here we were blown away by the aesthetics and hospitality we received from the staff. 100% would come back here if I visit Bali again!"
"This resort is the reason why I came Bali!
I enjoyed very well there
Pool, floating breakfast, yoga and so on.
The price is quite expensive but wort it!
Thank you"
"I cannot say enough great things about the staff, they are so helpful and friendly. We came initially for the beautiful views and jungle experience. And left blown away by the whole package ! 
The staff are evey bit as awesome as the resort and its views  I will recommend this to every person who says they are going to Bali !"
"Stayed here for 2 nights , location is a bit secluded, but it’s worth the journey. the valley pool villa has a breathtaking and romantic scenery. Only one restaurant is open due to covid-19, but the food still awesome and the staff still manage to keep their service at the highest standard possible. One of us has a GF diet requirement, and the staff cater it flawlessly, and even went through all the trouble of baking a GF birthday cake (my deepest gratitude). Since the location is practically adjacent to a forest, it is very common to find bugs and other critters around. I will highly recommend this place for people who enjoy nature and tranquility."
"Pros - the food was absolutely sensational!! Must try the Spaghetti Aglio Oglio, so delish! The service was so amazing and every single person was so lovely. The room was so big and comfortable and the pool was just something else. The shuttle to/from Ubud is really handy also. 
Cons - NONE!"
"Definitely exceeded our expectations. It has that WOW factor with the most helpful and polite staff. Super clean, and absolutely stunning views. I would definitely come back again"
"Stayed here with my wife and is hands down the most stunning down resort we have ever been to.  Staff are extremely friendly, facilities are amazing, three infinity pools hanging over the jungle and lovely restaurants."
"love this resort for the nature view at the balcony (mine was spacious 60m2 plus room-non villa), reasonably priced f&b as the resort doesnt allow gofood be delivered on premise, spa service was good n fair priced, the superb service n attention by all the staffs, many on site activities to choose from. the place is secluded with pristine air and jungle view. the downside is the western food should be improved although the local dishes r tasty; the bathroom sometimes give out a faint bad smell, should cover the drain hole? the toiletteries can do better by using the established brand names for spa products...will i return? you bet, I will..."
"My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon last week for 3 night, and wish we’d of booked longer! Everything about it is flawless, the food, the pool, the staff, the rooms! 
We booked a romantic meal in the chapel, and Marta served us all night. He was so nice, polite helpful and friendly. All the staff can’t do enough for you, it’s a must if visiting Ubud area."
"Food was amazing, service was amazing. Best hotel we’ve ever been to."
very nice place
"Awesome hotel, never saw such an humble staff, everything there is just too awesome."
"Staffs are friendly , service is great! The hotel facility is complete. The hotel provide yoga activity, professional photographer, and spa. The room is big with breathtaking view overlooking to the forest."
"It was such a fun and wonderful memory. It was a hotel in the middle of this kind of nature.. It was so strange and new. The standard of the hotel was high and everyone was friendly. The pool was also very pretty. But the only thing I was tired of was that the check-in took 2 hours. Still, the hotel's sincere attitude and wonderful hotel facilities comforted me. Also, the morning yoga program and walking program provided me with new experiences and freshness."
This is a wonderful place to stay in Ubud. The setting is spectacular the service is outstanding and very reasonable for a five star resort. Thank to Marta who provided excellent restaurant service. We enjoyed the Balinese evening and meal.
"We love everything about the Kayon!  The staff, the rooms, the food and all public areas are over the top!  I wish I could just stay forever!!  We can’t imagine staying anywhere else, and in fact, nothing will EVER compare!!!! Love it!"
"Best hotel for honeymoon!!! Tmpatnya tenang banget, fasilitas hotel lengkap, jadi ga prlu kemana2, stay at hotel aja. Spa, gym, lunch, dinner!! So happy to stay at jungle."
It was clean and nice
"The Kayon Jungle Resort really gave us a wonderful experience during our honeymoon stay. We got served by their very kind staffs and received extraordinary services. We will definitely come here again in the future. Thank you, Kayon!"
"The hotel has a beautiful scenery with lush of greens almost everywhere you go! 
They are set in a remote place, but they go GREAT with mindblowing surrounding. And the staffs, amidst COVID-19, going their way to make us very comfortable. 
Kudos The Kayon! You deserves 5 stars all the way"
The staff are very friendly and provide excellent service. Facilities are superb!!
"Location, room, pool area, food, spa…everything was spectacular! I am definitely coming back to Kayon Jungle next time i’m in Bali,"
"The service will take you away, that's what we felt when first landed our feet here. They took care everything smoothly, every staffs greet us properly, buggy drivers always ask how we enjoy our villa, they delivered fresh fruits, and many more. Attention to detail was super great like when we stood while waiting for the butler, the staff offered us bottled drink. A service we never expected but wow-ed because it was so thoughtful of them. The routine they provided such as morning walk, yoga, made the experience brilliant. It was truly genuine Balinese hospitality. The value was really worth it."
"This was an idyllic retreat to stay at for 3 days.  Beautiful location in the middle of the jungle, gorgeous resort and setting, fantastic food and cocktails. Definitely recommend it and it was better value than some of the other luxury resorts in Ubud"
"I’ve travelled a lot in my time but this resort is seriously the best I’ve ever seen, the staff are a 15 out of 10!!! I’ve never had such good service. Food is amazing and the facilities are stunning! Will definitely be coming back to this one :)"
"Kayon jungle location is very secluded and far from city centre. Hard to find food or store nearby. Once you are at the hotel, you only can enjoy the hotel facilities. Staffs nice and friendly although they forgot my welcome drink. Nice pool for sunbathing. Relatively new hotel but interior lack of special touch.  amenities are standart, room is clean, bed is nice. Bathroom is big but shower pressure can be better. View the forest. Breakfast is standart. This hotel Perfect for couple or honeymoon but i wont go back with kids."
The Kayon Jungle resort was amazing! The staff were so kind and attentive to every need. The resort itself is beautiful and very clean! The facilities provided a variety of entertainment for us and the hotel ran some event evenings during our stay with live music. We found a really good rate for our stay as it was just as things were reopening after covid. The staff were so happy to be seeing tourists again.
"All great, Ambience, Hospitality, View, and all Staff are awesome...."
"When I was stayed there, I don't think to go out. Just enjoyed the hotel facilites and the staff is very helpful"
"Good:
Wonderful staff, kind and helpful in any way
Big rooms with a good size balcony and very quiet 
Good big shower with large bathtub 
Amazing infinity swimming pools with view at the forest (hot tub incl)
Breakfast was very good, with plenty of choice (western/Asian)
Massage/ spa is really good
Overall a very complete and high quality resort 
Can be improved:
Internet was not really strong
Slippers/bathrobe not standard in the room( available when asking)
Not many amenities( no toothpaste or toothbrush)
Can be a bit dark on the lower floors walking to your room"
Best for couple and honeymoon. B
Food are awesome.  We love the food from KePitu Restaurant.
"Perfect natural scenery, nice swimming pool, and convenient facilities. It's a perfect experience just to rest. If I have a chance, I would like to visit again."
AmaZing stay !!! Will definitely be back
We had a lovely romantic escape at this hotel! The customer service is way above par and the facilities are breathtaking. The hotel does allow people to pay a 1 day price to use facilities only. We totally understand this from a business perspective but it did feel as if it took away from the value of what we were paying to stay there. We did appreciate that there was one level of the pool for hotel guests only which still allowed for some privacy. We dream of coming back again!
"This place is unrealistic and magical
The view and ambience is what we were searching for on such romantic trips! It’s the most perfect place to loose all stress and relax in the beauty of bali❤️"
"The pool is marvelous, second tier is big enough, deep 140 to exercise. Top tier pool has jacuzzi, warm water. Sun tanning bath at top tier nice enough to get full vitamin D.  We got there during November End, some rain, then so much clean and cool weather, even to just sit in the porch, looking at the valley, rethinking life, purpose and grateful to what gift we got. Every morning we had yoga class, helpful for muscle and shoulder pain."
A must do in Bali. wish we could stayed here longer
10/10. Best resort we’ve ever stayed at so happy thanks for everything 🙏
We only spent 3 days here but it was amazing!! We had an amazing Honeymoon! Thank you to all the staff at Kayon! We are sure coming back!
"Very kind steps, nice view, good food ..
Yoga class is wonderfull!!!!!!
I highly recommend to you!!!"
Amazing service and very kind and nice people!
Nice place to stay with your couple and family
"I love staying at The Kayon Jungle Resort! The staff and service are just impeccable! Spacious room and bathtub, great breakfast and menu selections, fantastic pool, serene surroundings, daily yoga class, walking tour, affordable spa. Time flies quickly here!"
I can’t recommend the Kayon Jungle Resort enough! Everything was perfect and the food was unreal.
don’t miss the photo session
"The staff is really nice. 
The pool is just amazing. 
However, there is no hot water in the room so it is impossible to take a bath. It is inconvenient for a five stars hotel in this region. 
I think you can have a better value for money somewhere else. It is a little overpriced."
"Hotel is beautiful, staff amazing. It is a really great place to rest and enjoy your time with a partner."
Beautiful beyond my expectation
"the view  of the hotel is excellent, the room is spacious, the food also delicious.  very well maintained.  but the road getting there is small..."
"huge room with huge balcony, having a nice afternoon tea with my fiancee here.
great view of the pool ! 
lot of free activities provided by Kayon 
and the food from the restaurant also pretty good :)"
"staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, services and facilities ar"
Friendly staff. Super accommodating. The pool was gorgeous.
"It’s a little bit far from ubud centre, scenery really nice, so much nature, very quiet and secluded place. Suitable for anyone who prefer the nature than the busy area…the best of all are the staffs, everyone of them so kind and helpful. Will recommend this hotel"
Very good hotel and service. Definitely will want to come back again.
"The moment we arrived, the staff are very nice, helpful. Even just at the lobby, we already served by one of the most stunning view we've ever seen. The staff kindly took us to our room while explaining almost very detailed about the resort. The food was amazing. Stayed at this resort was one of the best decisions we've ever made."
"The facilities, especially the pools were amazing. Staff was very friendly and helpful. One complaint, would be the variety of foods available (a bit limited). This is extra important due to the resirt's location which is quite far from any restaurants or diners."
The best resort at ubud
"The experience is worth the money. Really enjoyed the stay, staff and the food there! Definitely would go again"
"Best service we've ever received. Their staff makes you feel like you're the only people at the resort. Accomodations were superb . Breakfast was complimentary, as well as transportation. We felt like royalty!"
Despite few upgrade due to to after Covid great stay and staffs …worth spending few days
At normal (undiscounted)  prices this hotel is too expensive in my opinion. But wit the very discounts I got through Agoda the hotel is certainly worth its money.
"Great view, nice food, all the staffs are friendly👏"
Excellent weekend Gataway
"Very instagrammable hotel. Amazing facilities and a real jungle experience. The pools are beautiful and clean, the personnel is very helpful. It’s good to have a bike to get to the hotel as its quite away from the city center. Highly recommend to explore anyways!"
The room is actually build for couple all the setting was intended to it. The room is spacious  and sufficient for small family though with extra bed (which is limited). The design is marvelous with lots of swimming pool with Jacuzzi and heater. The food is delicious only perhaps during this pandemic lots of outlets were not open.
"This place is beautiful beyond words. It’s a little far from the airport but if you want a peaceful and relaxing place to stay, with breathtaking views ."
Amazing place
"Little bit out of the way but loved the engineering, views, room pools and on and on. Dinners with live entertainment. Recommend a balcony room over the villas which are out of the way - unless that is what you are after"
"It's recommended for couple holiday. However it's not kid friendly considering the steep stairs.
Overall experiences is nice. We have a special arrangement, seeing sunrise in the early morning with a very beautiful setup. Thank you, Kayon"
I had only one day and didnt wanna leave at all. Unique resort and nice - helpful staff
"what a wonderful.
This is my honeymoon and the best resort what I have ever seen.
I want to come here again when my 10th wedding anniversary."
"Thumbs up for the hospitality of all staff @ thus hotel. 
One of staff fixed my sister’s shoes, due to pandemic the shoes hasn’t been worn for a couple years. It Was broken while she use. Lucky her the shoes can be use for the rest of the holiday,"
"Plus:
1. All staff are very helpful, polite and well trained
2. Spacious room, clean with all basic amenities 
3. Good view, it's not extraordinary but if you live in the hectic city, this place is a good getaway to refresh your busy mind
4. Free shuttle to Ubud Center
To improve:
Foods. Maybe because it's in pandemic situation, there's only 1 resto open. Menu are limited and the taste can be improved"
good view dan Nyaman
"Great pool, great food, great rooms. Hallway bit dark. Dinner music too cheesy. Excellent service."
Best service
"Amazing place, very silent, surrounded by jungle, can hear the sound of birds, river flow and the hotel design is very romantic for couple.
The service is excellent."
"Huge swimming pool(max. height is 1.4m, both cool and warm pool prepared)
We took a type of private pool villa, though, we enjoyed shared pool rather than provate one because private one is given a bit scary due to lack of light and direct exposure to jungle so that so many bugs and lizards also enjoy our pool.
However whole staffs and facilities are so much convenient and kind so that we got a great experience during the stay."
"Nice view, ambience & service"
the staff is very friendly and helpful..their services is amazing
"It took us around 30-40 minutes drive from resort to Ubud center, so location is pretty remote. But the staffs are super friendly and attentive, they try to make our stay comfortable. If u stay at the Villa valley view be prepared of insects and bugs since its a jungle resort"
Nice place and nice facelities
We will definitely back again really like this hotel 🏨
An amazing resort. A pleasure to stay there and will definitely return
"The emplyees and managers were so kind.
Thank you for everything."
"Popular with honeymooners.  Considering that a lot of hotels have either closed or not been maintained well, this resort is clean with spacious rooms.  Food presentation is superb & breakfast selection was really good.  As resort is in forested area, extremely rustic feel given that buildings are exposed to the natural elements.  Resort provides free shuttle to Ubub town if u want to do a little shopping so that’s great.  Good & affordable spa too!  However do note tt as resort has only 38 rooms, they are pretty much booked up most days & thus unable to accede to check in/out beyond stipulated timings."
"It's a hotel you need to try to know. 
The nature is so near you and the level of peace is amazing. .
Hotel is also very nicely done and personal service"
"the staffs very kind and helpfull. 
i'll come back to this hotel.
swimming pool and whirlpool amazing"
"Initially just want to have a nice place for photo shooting... 
But it turn out to be a nice place for relax and lay low...
Because of the low crowd and alos numbers of rooms..."
"Unique first experience staying in a jungle resort with own private pool and having sunrise right in front of our bedroom. Overall staff is friendly and we enjoyed our stay. Staff could do better in following through to fix the safe deposit, cleaning the pool prior to guest check-in, to press clothes after washing, more vegetarian variety for breakfast and dinner. We had to ask and follow through on few of our requests, even better if the resort had followed through and update rather than guests having to check."
"If you want to enjoy the paddy field / forest view and spend time leisurely at the resort, then this is the right property for you. The spa massage is also very very good.
But if you want to go back and forth to Ubud, go out for lunch, back to hotel, then go again for dinner, then this may not be the right property to choose, because it's located quite far from Ubud centre."
Great hotel
This place is in a breathtaking spot and the pools are magnificent. The rooms are stunning and their breakfast is pretty decent. Where it falls down is that a lot of day visitors come to use the facilities for a fee. This means the service is a bit all over the place as they often don’t know if you are an actual guest staying and paying for premium service or a backpacker who has come for beers and Instagram opportunities. I would t recommend the room service as it was overpriced and average at best. Highly recommend staying a few nights though for the experience. My partner did a private art lesson which was awesome and they were SO sweet with all thei birthday surprises for me as it was my birthday. Overall 8/10 and I would probably go back if we got a good deal.
"full of Korean couples and western couples. No kids here because of its concept I guess. Lovely pool to get nice pictures, but the food was not comparable to that of other 5 star hotels in Bali. Staff members are nice. Hope the resort cares more about the dishes. They need to be more fresh and well cooked."
"The private villa was  nice with a pool, although we couldn't really swim because it was too cold. The villa was clean, but sheets was a bit old for a 5 star standard, but i really appreciate and love their staff, they were amazing, very thoughtful and helpful for any request we had. They also offered many activities that we could enjoy freely. Anyway i would recommend this resort for those who looking for a nature getaway, but not for those looking for luxury getaway."
service bagus sekali
"Nice and comfort hotel, no a lot opportunities around, staff is 10/10 pool facilities too. Pasta and other food delicious, life music in the evening"
"Kayon Jungle Resort is breathtaking and excellent value for money considering the quality of accommodation, food and included benefits. 
It’s slightly outside Ubud (about 15-20 minutes via the free shuttle which runs every hour from 9am to 8pm), this provides Kayon Jungle with extraordinary tranquility. 
There are twice daily yoga classes, an excellent gym, a spa, excellent breakfast and afternoon tea which is included, a cocktail hour allowing those in the villas upto 3 free cocktails each and 24 hour butler service. You can even have a floating breakfast if you have a private pool in your villa! 
The staff are so friendly and accommodating and we really felt as if we were in their home rather than a resort. 
Overall a lovely place which others may struggle to match in Bali (Ubud at least)"
"Me and my sister really enjoyed our stay at the Kayon Jungle Resort! The room was beautiful, big and well-equipped. Staff was very welcoming, friendly, hospitable and always willing to help. Breakfast was fantastic! Lots of options to choose from and the staff was very thoughtful and willing to make amendments to dishes to meet our dietary requirements. 
The territory is beautiful and the resort itself has a very relaxing atmosphere. 
The SPA was great! 
There were always different sorts of entertainments in the evenings, e.g Balinese traditional dances, live music etc. 
The resort located in the jungles, very quiet and calm area. The hotel provides a free shuttle to Ubud centre, which takes 45min. Was very convenient! 
We also appreciated the tours, which was possible to organise through the hotel. Tour to see the sunrise from the Batur mountain is the must! 
Yoga was very basic, would appreciate even more if there was a choice for more advance/all level classes."
"Even though we have the ""policy"" to always explore new locations Kayon Jungle Resort is the one where we need to make an exception.  We enjoyed our complete stay from the moment of arrival until our sad departure. Nice, very well decorated, large room with attention to all detail, AMAZING STAFF who knew our names from the very beginning, great location in the jungle with beautiful views, excellent facilities including the pools and gym. The spa was unforgettable where we spent more time than usual. Even though it takes cc. 30 mins to Ubud the location compensates for the time spent traveling. BTW the hotel offers free shuttle to Ubud that worked perfectly as well. The food was so awesome we spent every dinner at the hotel also opting for the special down at the jetty. Loved it.  
The early morning breakfasts with the view is something I could never get tired of. 
Thank you again for the staff for making our stay unforgettable."
"Stayed in The Kayon Jungle Resort in early Nov which was told was a newly opened resort. First thought after arrived in the resort was amazing. Although the location was slightly far from the city center and even our driver couldn't find the location at first since it was a brand new resort. The environment is extraordinary. Stayed for 4 nights, we booked the villa but first night out view is totally blocked by the trees surrounding. On the second day called reception to see whether room change was available, the staff was so helpful and help us blocked another room although the room was not what we have ordered. After changing rooms for two night we got the valley view villa what we booked for. All the staff are very professional. Food quality was above average, breakfast environment is good, staffs are nice in the restaurant. Staff at swimming pool are detail-mined, they provide towel proactively. The only
problem is too many insects and ants. Overall is a amazing hotels and staffs."

"Wow, the infinity pool  is amazing in the kayon jungle resort. it is a must visit when you visit ubud.
All the staff super friendly & the manager will greet you personally.
You will get breakfast, afternoon tea, evening snack in the pool when booking thru agoda. all the food is delicious. we like it.
The negative one is the location is quite far from the center of ubud so the car rental will charge more & because it is in the middle of jungle there will be an insect in your villa, but it dont bother us.
Overall Recommended to stay in here.
Please visit my youtube Livin Channel to see the videos of our stay in The kayon jungle resort."
"The Kayon Jungle Resort is somewhere I cannot recommend highly enough as a place for couples to enjoy Bali. From the location, to the resort, the friendly service, food and attention to detail, all excellent. The view of the valley is fantastic, and all suites have luxurious features. The staff are very attentive and helpful as well as proactive and often go the extra mile. There is a very good restaurant with a selection of Indonesian and other dishes. It is about 20 minutes from Ubud city centre and there is a free shuttle bus that takes you there and back every couple of hours so that is handy.
In short a fantastic resort, you definitely won't be disappointed!"
"We stayed at the kayon jungle for the first 4 nights of our honeymoon and were completely blown away. The resort absolutely breathtaking and the setting is just perfect. The food there isn't the best we've ever had but everything was had was tasty. Cocktail hour was a personal favourite of ours. It literally is free cocktails (whatever you want) for an hour with really yummy canapes. Even though the resort was fully when we were there it felt half empty and really personal. What makes this resort so special however is the staff. They literally cannot do enough for you. They go out of their way to quickly learn your names and personal likes and dislikes. Little touches like ringing to ask if you'd like to make dinner reservations or telling the other staff your allergies beforehand. All the people we have met in Bali have been so lovely but the staff in the kayon, especially the butler's are another level. 
Don't hesitate in booking this hotel. There's a reason it's all over Instagram."
"This resort is absolutely incredible for many reasons. The staff there are truly the kindest people we’ve ever ever ever met. The resort is stunning and has incredible views of the jungle!! We stayed at the Premier villa and it was out of this world. Private pool and jacuzzi, fridge restocked everyday for free, and the staff even came to our room every night to get the room ready for the bed time. This resort deserves to be a 7 star. We would rate it higher than the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, which is actually a seven start hotel. The food is delicious and they catered so so well to my girlfriends gluten and dairy intolerances (they had lots of alternatives!!). I highly recommend the Kayon Jungle Resort!!!!"
"Aside from the absolutely breathtaking views, everything at The Kayon Jungle Resort is impeccable from the moment you step out of the car into the foyer to be greeted by a warm, friendly Balinese smile to the butler room service, to the delicious (and well-priced) food - they even shared their recipe for Betutu Ayam with us! As always, it's the beautiful Balinese people that make the experience so special, will definitely be back for a longer stay."
"Amazing stay, worth the money ! Staff are so polite and attentive and remembered us by name at any interaction, and even knew allergies etc which made it very personal. We were given a free welcome drink and afternoon tea on arrival which were amazing. The pools were fantastic and such great views of the jungle. The dinner was the jungle BBQ which was delicious and the meal was accompanied with a singer, the price of the food was very reasonable. In the morning we were able to attend a yoga session followed by a walk in the jungle viewing the local village, all included in the price. Breakfast was also included and had a variety of courses we were spoilt for choice. Following breakfast we had a photographer take us around the site and a free digital photo was again included in the price of the stay. The hotel is situated in north Ubud, not far from the Tegallalang rice fields, so a bit far from the centre but it truly is an unreal experience and well worth the visit !"
"We spent the first three nights of our honeymoon here and couldn't be happier! Kayon jungle resort have the friendliest, most attentive staff from the moment you enter the property (the airport transfer they organised was also very good!) We stayed in a pool villa with incredible views looking back toward the coffee plantation. The room was serviced twice daily, we had a fantastic 'butler', Dwipa, and the golf buggies that transport you around the resort are a cool bonus. We loved spending our mornings at the yoga pavillion, the meals were all great. Only"
"My first time at Bali with a couple of friends, we couldn't  choose a better place to be. we were amazed from the welcoming at the hotel to the outstanding service from all the employees ...I dont have enough words to express my gratitude to all of them. Beautiful hotel, rooms, facilities,food,service, view, this is the whole package in one place...the Kayon Jungle Resort."
"The Kayon Jungle Resort is amazing! All the staff are warm and helpful, and the resort itself is beautiful beyond measure. There are plenty of activities to keep you busy all day at the resort, and the traditional Balinese activities and yoga activities were my favorite. Also, the restaurant on-site (KePitu Restaurant) makes delicious and beautifully presented food. The Indonesian staples were my favorite. Would definitely go back in a heartbeat!"
"We spent three nights at Kayon jungle resort for our honeymoon. We were greeted with a free room upgrade and pleasant honeymoon surprise.  The staffs are extremely friendly and attentive. The views from our villa was incredible. The room was serviced twice daily, we had a fantastic 'butlers'. The food are great as well. Highly recommend anyone who want to have quiet, romantic and luxurious couple getaway."
"From the moment we came to the moment we left, my wife and I were in love with the Kayon Jungle Resort. The views from our balcony and the pools were amazing and I can't say enough about the service of the staff. Everyone was so nice and willing to help and provide whatever was needed in a timely manner. Highly recommended and we would absolutely come back in the future."
"If you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle the Kayon Jungle Resort is your place. The location (though it takes a bit of a drive) is beautiful. The facilities were great - new and clean. Kayon hires young, local Balinese workers and they are very hard working and enthusiastic. We very much enjoyed our stay."
"I’ve seen so many great reviews for this place and my wife and I had stayed at the Kayon in Ubud as well, which we really liked. This is very different. The Kayon has an exclusive and luxurious vibe and is very private with amazing staff. The Kayon Jungle, although still very nice was not up to the same standard yet. We arrived and had a tour of the hotel. It’s about a year old so everything is in great shape as you’d expect. The pool area is very impressive as are the reception, lobby and restaurant areas. Our room was lovely and large but there was a used cotton bud on the floor by the bin, but other than that great cleanliness. 
We are a couple, 40 and 30 years of age. Well travelled and 3rd time in Bali. We struggled with reviewing this hotel. I think to give people a fair impression I would score it two ways. From 7pm until 11am we would score it 4* as it is a very nice place. The views are ok, but there is an adventure park opposite and a busy road that you can see and hear the odd car from. But still quite nice. These hours are when the hotel is only the hotel guests and still feels nice and not too busy. 
Then from 11am-7pm the hotel allows the public to pay and use the top two tiers of swimming pools. From this moment it feels like a very young, Instagram obsessed young persons day trip. People literally queuing up to strike a yoga pose on the edge of the pool and gaze out meaningfully whilst done up like they’re about to go clubbing!! It’s great for people watching but it does really get old and cheapens the whole experience.
Breakfast was ok but took them 40 minutes to bring us a coffee from ordering so we sat there waiting and then finally asked someone but then got brought four coffees within the next ten minutes! I think they are still trying to tweak things. It seemed to work better at other hotels where you were assigned a server at your table and then that person looked after your drinks and food until you had finished at that table. 
At the Kayon"
"Everything about this resort was absolutely fantastic. From the moment you pull up, the staff were amazing, the view to die for, the arrival drink and free cocktail hour served with canapes (for villa guests).
Jump on the buggy and head down to your villa, my mouth dropped, pure luxury. Complimentary bottle of champas and room service, we were set for the night.
Breakfast was beautiful, not buffet style, served as ordered. Delicious.
Shuttle bus into Ubud leaves every two hours and takes approximately 30 mins.
Food in the restaurant and by the pool are great, delicious big meals.
Bali traditional dance at dinner one night and fire dancing by the pool another night. 
Overall I can not fault the resort, had the best stay. If you want to splurge in Bali. This is the place for you."
"Amazing new resort by the Kayon just opened late 2018.  If you think Ubud Hanging Garden's got world class infinity pool in the rice fields/ forest, consider The Kayon Jungle the fully upgraded version with 3 layered pools.  On the top level they even got a huge heated plunge pool overlooking the valley and a fully equipped bar to offer you cocktails.  Definitely pick the ""valley view pool villa,"" with unblocked views.  
Butler Gusti is amazing!  The only downside is that it's still up 30 min. north from ubud center, which makes it difficult to get around, especially if you want to rent a scooter and ride in the night, no lights!"
"I would like to say this is one of the best place if you want serenity and if you want to spend quality time with your partner, very romantic, very serene, this is really a place for  honeymooners, not a place for family with children or kids, esp toddlers. But perfect for couples... thank you kayon jungle, highly recommended, btw my partner really loved the bag in the room 😊"
The weather was fine but the pool is still cold. Lucky the premium room with warm pool. The wine list is not good . Hope it would be improved next time
"The resort is booming in Korea and I was able to see why it is. 
All staffs are so kind that i was impressed by."
"We really enjoyed everything of the kayon jungle resort. The amazing jungle view, the beautiful swim pool, the most delicious food, and all the caring friendly staffs! Everything was perfect. And I’d like to especially appreciate one of the staff, Hendrick🤵‍♂️ You made our stay here more pleasant and comfortable. Thank you very much. We will come back next year! Thank you everyone and see u guys again"
I have travelled all around the world Mexico Jamaica dubai and lots of other places I can say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in ...loved it
"The pool is three levels and it has a shared jacuzzi where many people fit, the view is amazing. But it was cold in the morning. 
They help the local community which I find great!!
The rooms are huge and super comfortable!! Personally, did not like the bed, it was hard for my taste. 
Breakfast is a la carte. We tried the pool bar and the restaurant too, all the food is AMAZING. If you dont stay here I would recommend to have dinner here. 
It is not so near the Center of Ubud, you will have to go by car. They have shuttle bus but you have to preschedule your place and they go every three hours. 
Things to improve, more frecuency in their shuttle busses. Complementary sauna. The gym is very basic too."
Infinity pools are fantastic and hotel staff are all friendly but location is a little bit far
Such a delightful place to relax 🙏
Kind staff and luxury facilities
Beautiful views and lovely staff.
"Amazing hotel, we enjoy of our stayed, breakfast is very delicious!"
good service
Best stay of my life
