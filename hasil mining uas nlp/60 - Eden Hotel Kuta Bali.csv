Very nice and big hotel near airport and affordable. Spacious rooms and clean pool. The view from balcony are the best
"by far the best Hotel in this price range. Friendly staff,  clean room  and safe place to stay.  One negative point is the restaurant  food.  I don't like the food but there are restaurants  very close. i have booked for 3 days but extended to 17 days and it worth ."
We stayed in the hotel only for one day but we were so satisfied with the location of the hotel the staff and the cleanliness. The breakfast was good and delish.  The room was cozy and felt safe.  The location of the hotel was convenient for late night provision stores.
"For the price this hotel is very nice despite of the towels were smelly and our bed sheets were little damp. They tried to fix this straight away. 
We got a fridge and a kettle/water boiler in the room. 
Nice and clean swimming pool. 
Good breakfast. 
Nice staff."

"Nice place, very close to mall and food center,but watch your date, when peak season it is very crowded, need at least 1 hour to get in or out.
Comfy place need a little touch up, because its old building"
"Eden Hotel Kuta, a premium 5 star hotel and very pleasant stay we had. We booked hotel once we see it from outside while roaming in the kuta street, we had other hotel booked but we cancel and booked Eden Kuta and It was our best experience. Very Nice ambiance in hotel, at reception, in swimming pool and in dinning area. We booked Breakfast and very happy from their services. We asked them to parcel our breakfast when we need to go for Nusa Penida and they did it. Also they have water dispenser facility which is one of the best so far I see in any hotel, you need not purchase water bottles again and again. Overall a great value hotel in Bali if you are in Kuta. Near to Airport, Beach, Matahari and Vegetarian restaurant.  We must recommend EDEN KUTA. Thank you very much Eden Staff for your services."
"Good food,good place,and have humble staff,so you must try to stay at Eden when you come to Kuta Area"
"Nothing wrong with it except the smelly towels. Location is great, staff is even better! No complaints ! But I don’t recommend to book the shuttle to airport from hotel. It’s like 3 times more expensive than using the app."
Staff is always friendly. I requested ground floor and they gave me ground floor. Staff is very friendly. Good location near lots of food. Beach is not far.
"We used this hotel 2 times as it is near the airport. 
Cheap clean hotel and a good location close to restaurants . 
We preffered the rooms on the upper floors rather than ground level. 
Nice staff."

Walking distance to shopping malls, small markets  and bars. Not far from Kuta beach  also close to airport."
"May be it is rainy season now, it's too cheap compare to service I got. More than expectation"
"Very supportive staff, they offer fried rice or noodles for pure vegetarians on demand.  The hotel also allow outside food.  Location is very good, but far from beach.  Yu have super markets and necessary shops on door step. Good hotel if you are taking your family to Bali."
Location was superb. Close to many interesting places in Kuta area. Close to airport
"Close to the heart of Kuta , the traditional outdoor Balinese stir fried food stall just outside the Lippo mall is exceptionally good and cheap . Hot satay , fried rice , kong choy stirred fried very tasty 👍👍👍"

Transportation is easy. There a lots of restaurants and massage outlets in a radius 1km. The hotel breakfast is also quite ok."

"Best value of money
Rating 8/10
Location 9/10"
"The rate per night is very cheap. It is located in front of Anvaya Hotel, which was the conference location when I visited Bali. It is very close to the airport so no need to rush for your flight. The WIFI is okay. The staff are friendly. They allowed us for an early check in since we arrived early. They have TV, percolator, coffee and tea, and mini fridge. They also have body soap and toothbrush and toothpaste. I enjoy my stay there. They also make up your room every day and put new water bottles. My only comment is that they should consider checking their bath towels. I honestly do not like its smell. Please improve it and everything will be fine about the hotel."
"This hotel offers a lot from good food that they served, accommodating staff and also clean facility. They also give welcome drinks from their cafe"
The staff are very nice and so accomodating!
"Central Kuta with clean rooms, friendly staff and fair prices. The breakfast included was great, and the setting was well appointed and peaceful. I would come back."
"this hotel is very clean, very good location in the kuta happening central, breakfast was nice, staff are courteous. will come back to this place"
"Stayed there for 3 days  - thoroughly satisfied with the experience at Eden Hotel, Kuta. Breakfast spread was especially good along with the locational advantage of being situated just 1.5 kms away from the airport. Highly recommended."
"Near to Airport, so we can have a earlier rest after a night flight. Simple buffet breakfast with egg station. Surprise with this room rates. Value for money stay."
Nice unique hotel with yummy breakfast...
It has everything you need for a short transit and want to be near the airport. Really cheap but decent option
"Walking distance  to Waterbom, Lippo Mall, Kartika Discovery Mall and many restaurants. Clean rooms, nice pools, tasty brekky, nice cafe and cheap in house restaurant prices.  Would definitely return."
The staffs are very friendly.  The room is clean and location is good too. It was worth it!
Over all good

다 좋았음
"Good service, good facility"
Good hotel to stay
"Best Price, clean room, large swimming pool, strategic location"
Good hotel to stay
The hotel is pretty clean with helpful staff.Close to several Indian restaurants and airport.Close to beach German which is 5 minutes walk.Kuta beach is also not far away.
Very happy to stay at Eden
The room is considerably large and it has a balcony. The bed is comfortable and electrical socket are evenly distributed around the room. The only small critique I have is the AC is not that cold at 16 degrees and no room slippers are available in the room.
very recomended for everyone who wants to traveling with low budget
"Best service, clean and friendly staff"
"the staff are really friendly and accommodating. walking distance to malls,  great restaurants and the beach"
Easy to find halal food near by. The hotel serves good breakfast
"Just a few comments; Excellent for the money. Very comfortable beds. Restaurant is better than a lot of others on the street and not more expensive, most of the time actually cheaper with a beautiful setting high above the street. Personnel is really nice. Not a Balinese decor, it is contemporary. Pool bar plays pretty cheap annoying pop music all day and part of the evening, not an enjoyable ambiance unless you are partying then I guess it will be great.  I am mentioning this last one as it does not only affect people in the pool but most of the rooms around that pool ; they have another set of rooms around the pool for children with no music."
"I was put in the hallway of ground floor near exit, the noises are unbearable. The tenants seems to be mostly not respecting and like to yell and talked loudly in the hallway as if its their home. None of the staff was seen to control it even though complaint. 
Ive gotta be fair that this hotel is value for money and come with free parking. BUT if possible do ask for a higher floor and away from the hall way and the street mess, siren, car honk, etc."
"We arrived from the airport and it was raining. Transportation was arranged by the hotel with extra charge of 90k which is fine. 
We went up get shower and ready for dinner. Since that it was our first day in Bali n it was raining, we ask help from reception to help us book a grabcar. They were not helpful they say they don’t have grab app which is ridiculous. We end up just stay until rain stops n walk to nearby small local shop. 
This place is really easily accessible to nearby shopping malls just when u arrived late night or due to flight delay, u might wanna buy a simcard first for grabcar/gojek booking.
Room was comfy and clean."
2nd time at eden and still good
Nice hotel in the heart of Kuta.  The stay was in the middle of the pandemic so not everything was the same as usual but the hotel seemed to be doing everything they could to keep people safe.  My only suggestion would be for rubbish bins in the pool area so people might not leave all their empty food containers on the tables.
Very good service location and very good value for money
We reached late at night. There were some problem to the room allocated to us but the staff was very attentive n changed our room until we are satisfied. They even apologised again the next day. It was a short day as we departed early morning the next day
"the hallway on the 5th floor smells like wet shocks, and the basement parking is smells bad as well but other than that everything is awesome"
Value for money .very efficient  and polite helpful  staff..
"Kind staffs, clean and good hotel, comfortable bed and good location. Recommended!"
"The rooms were clean, affordable and the hotel is situated in a good location close to everything."
"Top hotel, between 2 malls, but too many Indians ,very nice pools"
"Good service location pool bar room wifi t v reception clean , Indonesian breakfast, only problem wooden floor near the pool very unstable , other than that all good ."
"Booked a transit room as we checked out of our hotel at 11:00 am and had a flight that evening, so it was exactly what we needed to store our lagauge and shower before our flight. Price and location was brilliant. Thanks Eden Hotel☺"
Afordable price with facilities
They have cars just to pick up and drop off at airport
"Strategic location. Value for money. Spacious room. Nice breakfast with great atmosphere.
The AC is not cold. Elevator need routine service."
"I was looking for a hotel nearby the airport, with reliable WiFi connection, buffet and safe deposit in the room. Stayed for 8 nights in the hotel.
Pros:
+ Good value for the price;
+ 30 minutes by foot to Kuta beach;
+ Kettle in the room, 2x tea bags, 2x coffee, 2x 0,5 l water bottles daily;
+ Hot water was always available;
+ Safe deposit in the room big enough to store 16 inch laptop;
+ Old AC but was working properly;
+- Internet connection speed via WiFi with not more than 250 kb/sec. Luckily, it was enough for Zoom video conferences;
+- Bed sheets were clean but with old stains;
+- Towels were clean but were more of grey colour rather than white;
+- The room and the hotel need renovation;
+- Just OK buffet for breakfast;
Cons:
- The minibar in the room was dirty with mildew;"
"Good location just far enough away from the madness of Kuta town but within easy reach off everything. Excellent breakfast, nice pool area and swim up bar."
"Room was spacious and clean, staff were outstanding! Breakfast was nice and had a good variety. It was very close to Discovery Shopping centre and water bom. Only negatives was most of the rooms were over the main pool area and was to loud at times and place a bit dated. Overall a pleasant stay."
I loved everything about Eden Hotel except the mosquitoes and  few ants in the room!
"Loved it ex the boring local music at breakfast, and low pressure in shower"
You can even request the breakfast to be packed for you even at 4am when you have anneaely tour
"+
Spacious room, the biggest room  compare to others
Room ; good and well maintained 
Has a balcony 
Good buffet breakfast 
- 
I booked a non smoking room, but I can smell a very strong smoked ambience in my rooms"
Due to Covid-19 not able to stay there
The rooms are clean and comfortable. The service is good. The spa is also good.
Great hotel for a short stay. Bed was comfy.
"Good for price 
Clean right near water bom park and opp dynasty hotel 
Was killer for the price we paid"
"Breakfast used to be sensational but now Pre Order, sadly the Bacon is like Cardbord so if it's part of your diet mainstay for Breakfast you won't like it, miss the Chef making Fresh Omelets but is Great Valu for Money"
This hotel is very nice from the price and facility and location. Sadly ant come so easy when you have food in room and there was bird shit in balcony.
Lovely hotel friendly staff and good pool.  Breakfast is very good.
The facilities n prices are good
"Value for money hotel! Loved the pool and mini balcony to sun our items too! There's only toothbrush for amenity, but it's alright. Staff were friendly. Would come here again :)"
Great place to stay.
"Clean, cheap, good view, good staff"
The hotel is near in the airport and everything is just around the corner. Will surely recommend this to our friends and family.
"Unfortunately there were some painting works near the pool which was annoying. 
The hotel although clean is slightly run down, and basic furniture. Bed very comfy, pool side room very lovely. Food from restaurant very tasty especially the Nasi Goreng."
Comfy beds. Busy area with restaurants
"Value for money. 
15 minutes walk to Kuta beach 
Near to Catholic Church
Near restaurants 
Near airport"
Near from Kuta Beach
Well placed. The pool bar area has very noisy machines ( i don’t know if it comes from the bar)so I could not really sit out on the balcony to relax. Other than that it’s a VERY comfortable and practical room. Hotel is right in the heart of Kuta
