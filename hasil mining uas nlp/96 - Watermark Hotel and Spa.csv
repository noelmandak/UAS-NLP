Column 1
"I absolutely loved this hotel. if you are hesitating to choose this hotel, i hope this review changes your mind. first of all, watermark is in an incredible location. it is just 7 mins drive from the airport, and there are several good warongs located nearby (sambal lalapan and babi guling). there is even an alfamart nearby if you need to do some late-night shopping. it is near to popular places like jimbaran bay as well. the staff were also incredibly friendly to us, even when we walked past the front desk at 1am, they would greet us with a smile on their faces. room service is also quick and efficient. we were given the wrong bed size (asked for super king but got 2 queen beds), and they changed it at 6pm the same day. i also asked for an iron and they were able to deliver it to my room (with an ironing board!) in 5-10 minutes. 
facilities wise, there is an infinity pool at the top storey. i did not manage to use the pool but it looked clean and spacious. the outdoor bar is closed though. there is even a gym with the basic gym equipment. there is a cafe at the hotel lobby, which i really appreciated because we could stop by whenever for some quick drinks. there is also a japanese restaurant right beside the hotel, and we were provided 10% vouchers for it. 
the room was exactly as pictured. large, clean and spacious. small downsides was that the bathtub took too long to fill because of water pressure, but i didnt really mind it. do note that the laundry prices are quite hefty, so i would not advise you to do laundry at the hotel. but the room is amazing, and i did not even need to use my adapters because the plugs were the same as my country. the communal space in the suite room is extremely useful, especially if you are travelling in big groups. there is even a day bed at the balcony. overall, i am really glad i chose this hotel. i would 100% come back."
"We booked 2 separate suite rooms for our family trip and the hotel has kindly arranged our rooms to be side by side. Rooms were very spacious and clean. The bed is super big. There is microwave and kitchen sink in the room which I liked. The staff were very friendly and polite.
Only small concerns are we had to open the door to air out the old smell (maybe because the room was empty for quite some time) and the aircon for one of the rooms took a bit slow to cool the room. But it was all good after a few hours.
We had a great stay and definitely will be coming back."
"We have a wonderful time staying at Watermark Jimbaran. We love the location which is very near to Babi Guling Karya Rebo & Naughty Nuri’s. And there are some convenience store nearby & atm. The hotel also provide a shuttle to/from kedonganan beach
where you can find a lot of seafood restaurant or you can buy it directly from the wet market. The room was spacious & clean. Everything runs well: air con, hot water, fridge, microwave, water dispenser, tv & the internet connection is good. The bed is so comfy. The staff were all nice, helpful & polite. They have two decent pool. And it’ s only take 10minutes to take you to the airport."
"The Hotel is near from Kedonganan Beach and Market, you can ask the staff to drop you in beach. And it's easy to find restaurant and mini market around the hotel. The breakfast is delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful!  I would love to come here again"
"I was stayed with my friends, so in total 4 people in one room, surprisingly still comfortable even 4 peoples in one from, clean room, good service, strategic location near airport also Jimbaran, Uluwatu and kuta :)"
"Excellent suites hotel rooms, very clean, comfy and we feels like in japan..The warm welcome staff, the facility is 5 star, and even the location in great.."
"My family had a wonderful stay here. The kids enjoyed the play area and swimming pools. The room was spacious and it was good to have a bathtub! 
The walk to the beach is a little far for young kids but there is a shuttle bus option. My only gripe was breakfast finishing at 9:30 which was annoying.
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and local restaurants nearby!"
Staffs were friendly. Location is near airport. Room is clean and spacious. Looking forward to staying in the hotel again!
Room was clean. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommended and will come again!
"We love the room, its big, clean and have a window patio that you can sit on.  The hotel exterior also looks nice. There is a spa and Japanese restaurant in the hotel but we didn't get to try it. There is a free hotel shuttle to nearby mall (at certain time only). Location is great. 15-20 mins to airport, 5 minutes to Jimbaran beach. There is few street food and restaurant around the hotel. Convenient store and ""babi guling resto"" just a cross the hotel. 
The only bad things if i have to nitpick are small pool and small parking lot (for those bringing their car)
Otherwise its a great hotel and would definitely come back"
"Location is very strategic, clean, nice staff."
"We took room with pool...
Very very spacious!!
2Queen Bed combine!!!
What do you think about it??
Have your own water dispenser!!!
That's the free mineral!!
Instead of getting 2 bottles...
They provide u a whole water dispenser!!!
With hot & cold options!!
that could last you more then 3D2N stay...
Downside is...
The bathtub, when close the blockage it doesn't really trap the water in the bathtub well...
We were running the water for 1hr.. not even half of the tub....
So we use towel to block it...
No Netflix.. 
Normal TV channel only
Overall 9/10"
Great location with easy excess to places and great staff too
"Pros: 
1. Super duper king bed
2. Spacious room
3. Massive bathtub
4. Dispenser, microwave, coffee maker👌
5. Free coffee and tea for suite guests from 11am-10pm
6. Day bed in balcony 
7. Helpful staffs
Contras:
Breakfast was not good enough. To little choice. Put more option. 
But overall, this hotel is beyond our expectations.
Perfecto! 👌"
chose to stay here again one more time in just few days
"Love this hotel so very much. 
Clean, big space, amazing service, etc etc
Totally will come again and again"
The room is so spacious
"Clean, simple and modern style hotel, next to Bigul Karya Rebo, Nuri's, Jimbaran Seafood, location in the center between Kuta Legian and Uluwatu Nusa Dua.  Unfortunedly, the wall between rooms is to thin, so we can hear all noises from next room."
"Fasilitas mewah,bersih,so far sangat value for money"
"Good location; near mini marts and some famous restaurants. Sadly, our stay was during the World Cup final and it was not broadcasted 😭 It’s a big blow for our family as we were all looking forward to watching the final in the comfort of our room. We like the water dispenser in the room as well as the spacious suite room and balcony. Staff are friendly. Breakfast food is not bad, not so many varieties but I think it’s acceptable for a 4-star hotel."
Will always coming back
"Staff very helpful and efficient and the rooms were spacious and well appointed, Very close to airport so excellent for transit travellers. However the hotel is some distance from the beach and other sights and you will require local transport to get around."
Found perfect deal for perfect size of room during our stay in Jimbaran.
"near kedonganan beach and plenty of local food like karya rebo, nasi bu gonde"
"We stopped for 2 nights, excellent hotel near to the airport.
Breakfast OK.
Rooms are very spacious and the biggest bed we've ever had.
Staff super helpful.
Will definitely stay again on our way I to Bali."
"Near to the airport, very good if you are on transit"
Proses reservasi yang mudah.. dapet welcome drink selagi check in.. kamarnya sangat nyaman.. Dan bersih.. staf hotel sangat ramah  Dan membantu.. Bahkan ketika Harus early check out pun sangat membantu.. Thank you for the experience 🙏
The hotel is pretty nice and highly accesible. Also across is the renowned babi guling Karya Rebo. Extremely value for money.
"I checked out in the earlier morning and left my bag at the reception, told them be back by evening because of the tour, and they are kind enough to offer me a shower FOC with towel after I came back from the tour. Very thoughtful ❤️"
"This hotel is located on the main streets where you are able to access to restaurants, mini marts, laundry, banks and even beach side restaurants!
The cleanliness of this hotel is excellent and the it is very spacious.
Much recommended for business, leisure and honeymoon!"
"The room was quite spacious, it also comes with a convenience store in front of the hotel. Nice staff"
"Nice and spacious rooms, two swimming pools, outstanding breakfast buffet. Loved it!"
10mins walk to Jimbaran beach. The staffs very nice and helpful. And the room is very clean. All good!
Nice suite room with affordable price
Not much variation for breakfast and taste not good too
"The bathtub was big, the room was large and clean, and there were slippers, so I was able to spend a comfortable time.
The staff were all kind.
My friend was staying in the next room so I used the connecting door to go back and forth :)"
nice place to stay in jimbaran
"we really enjoyed our stay here. the only downside was the noise.. we could hear noise from other rooms, and the location was also a bit far from the sightseeing center. If only i only traveled with my husband, i'd give solid 5 star for everything :) you also have to try the Japanese restaurant at the lobby!! it was the best Japanese restaurant ever <3"
It was a great experience staying at this hotel. Famous suckling pig restaurant is nearby! Staff was friendly and nice! Did nice surprise for my sisters birthday. Thank you!
Friendly staff
"The hotel was good location wise, staff are helpful and respectful… please do not use the hotel landline 📞 for making calls as it cost you earth. Very unfairly priced for the use of landline. I only made a couple of phone calls to airport for a very short time and they charged me heaps. There were a couple of maintenance issues with toilet and bathrooms. Make sure you checked your room throughly before you check in. Breakfast is okay if you don’t want to go out and search for a place to eat. Gym area was very small and the equipment are not functioning as they should."
"We late check in and fast.
The Room is very specious, cozy, clean but a little bit noise.
The Bathroom is nice with bathtub and hot water.
The pools and the roof top nice.
The Restaurant need more provide in high season, but they service is good (I asked for papaya).
Overall nice hotel good location not to far to the beach (jimbaran beach)."
"I was here for business. Very clean, rooms nice size with all amenities.  Breakfast is more like dinner than a breakfast. A bit out of the way but taxi’s easy to get. I would stay here again"
Decent place and value for money. However the walls are too thin. Can hear conversations and foot steps from other rooms.
The room is nice and spacious but a bit of outdated.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.
"Below expectation. Bathroom fixtures are old and heavily stains, some are broken.  Swimming pool is old and not well maintained. Breakfast quality is not a 4 star hotel standard."
"stayed for 4 days in one of the suites.  good size room, comfortable and well appointed.  included breakfast and access to the lounge club.  the facility is conveniently located 10 minutes from the airport in a local neighborhood somewhat removed from the shops and restaurants frequented by tourists.  breakfast, while included, is at best ok.  the snacks in the lounge club, aside from the coffee and bottled beverages, are stale.  the staff is friendly and accommodating.  the facility is starting to get old and tired and in need of some refreshing."
"Great location, easy access for any online drivers, very close to jimbaran beach and eating places in uluwatu"
"Excellent hotel room size, large bed, two nice pools (one at roof top and one on ground floor)."
Old facilities.  Nice and helpful staff.  Selection in breakfast buffet can be greatly improved.
"The price for the extra bed is ridicilous, but overall the hotel is strategic and they have proper parking space for cars"
"Jimbaran isn’t my favourite part of Bali but sometimes it makes sense to stay here. Our overnight stay at Watermark was one of this occasions. 
The room rates are reduced, but probably not as much as the overall experience. The hotel is clearly (and understandably) operating on a shoestring at the moment. Skeleton staff. Water features and even lights switched off. Much of the hotel closed.
We reserved two rooms with breakfast. Had we known we’d have to eat it in our rooms ahead of booking, we’d have chosen to stay elsewhere. We also had to order the evening before from 2 options - western or Indonesian. Both menus were a bit weird - probably designed to use up excess food rather than to reflect the options they depicted. Spaghetti bolognaise for breakfast? In spite of the hotel being almost empty, they still managed to screw our order up and decided an argument about it on the phone was preferable to fixing it.
I used the (small) gym a couple of times. Aircon not working - it was hot as hell, despite maintenance coming to fix it whilst I was there on the first day.
It’s tough times for everyone right now, but I think, making a direct comparison, there are better options nearby until things return to normal."
"Large great looking hotel.
Very large bedroom, we had one without a balcony.
Super large bed, it was like two doubles put together...you could lose each other in it.
About the only cons:
Room service and bar service couldn't be put  back to room, this was advised as we didn't put down a deposit (was never asked to do so, happy too).
Bathroom whilst large was dated and could have been cleaner in corners etc with some mould.
Rooftop pool, impressive looking but shallow amd bar was closed.
Would i be happy to stay here again, absolutely.
Location, close to airport, nuri ribs, convenient stores and Jimbaran bay, but not alot can walk around too."
"Hotel is opened in 2015 and looking on the current situation I find the maintenance is poor, cleanliness and maintaining glass and wooden furniture is very poor. 
this hotel should have a better condition if they could achieve maintenance standard of a 4 stars hotel."
"The room we stayed sucks big time:
1. AC .. they have sensors, so it will turn off if you are not in the room. So, when you return to your room, it will be hot. See number 2.
2.AC is under powered. You set temperature at 18 but it didnt get cold. 
3. We were charged additionals for kids, even in a pool suites that can fit 4 people. Fine, we paid the extras, but, there were poor communications from front desk to housekeeping, which means DAILY you must ask extra shampoos, soaps, towels, amenities. We are there to relax, but we were really bothered that little things like this is overlooked.
Dont get me wrong, staff is kind and apologetic, but it does seems like poor management. Maybe the Japanese manager doesnt care anymore, which is an embarassment since every hotels in Japan are always perfect!
5. Equipments are old! Bidet not working
6. Water pressure is really really low. Very very disappointing.
Lastly, they will check your room before you check out to ensure nothing is damaged.. maybe it is a Bali thing but, i find the pratice ridiculous and uncommon in other parts of the world.
Noted, this hotel is not Hilton, if you have low expectation, maybe it is fine, but it is what it is. Not recommending this hotel."
With large and great interior at the room so perfect
"The good 
1. Huge bed
2. Water dispenser 
3. Bath tub 
4. Huge room and separate table and sofa in front of table to sit 
5. Value for money 
The bad 
1. 8 am renovation even on a Sunday 
2. Furniture shows wear and tear and rustiness
3. Safe was not working (we highlighted this the first night  and this was not followed up after two nights)
4. When we woke up on the third night the door electronic lock was not working - anyone could have come into the room. We reported this and they had to have it manually repaired but we were about to check out already 
5. Breakfast wasn’t great 
6."
"good value, friendly and helpful staff.  the facility is looking and feeling a little tired and could use a makeover.  the breakfast is, at best, satisfactory as the selection is very limited."
Bathroom was not clean and much more outdated then the pictures showed. Way overpriced
"We have stayed 2 nights during our trip to Bali. Never met such things happened. There was a rat inside the room which hiding behind the fridge. 
We have to ask the staff to get rid the rat at midnight. Could never imagine what happen inside the room during our stays until we discovered the rat. 
We made our complaints and nothing.
Travel quite lots and stay at variant hotel thus never experience a rat inside your room. Would never come back again."
"breakfast ok, but need improvement on the cleaniness especially bed, on 2nd day three of my member of group have been itchy when wake up in the morning, its like a bed bug. hopefully it will improve"
Breakfast tdk layak utk hotel bintang 4!
Breakfast very ordinary. Bit average for the price charged is all I say
"Let's start with the positives first.  The staff is very nice, the room is more spacious than most, and the location is pretty good.  The positives end here.
The hotel is looking very tired from the not-so-good maintenance regime.  The room is not clean enough.  The kettle is emitting a burnt plastic smell when being used to boil water.  The bathroom has some grubby spots.  The WiFi internet connection is the worse part.  It's literally blackhole, kaput for most of the time.  Won't be coming back."
"Location situated at the heart of Kuta but the hotel building is very old including the interior of the room. Toilet unable to flush in the morning for two days due to low water pressure, breakfast included but not nice at all. Not recommended for big family & will definitely not coming back again"
"Pros: At 64 sq m, Suite Room is big with good price.  Good for photos. Free transport to Beachwalk mall and Beach club. 
Cons: Toilet flush not in good condition, rain shower head not maintained, split air-con not maintained, Breakfast selection needs improvement, Japanese Breakfast option is a no-no(be warned). Rooftop pool is small. The suite lounge is just 2 drink dispenser, a fridge with a few cans of beer,  a Nestle Coffee machine and some local tidbits. That's it.  If you are expecting Japanese standards, don't come."
"This is my third time staying at this hotel. I used to love this hotel and recommended this hotel to so many friends and family but I don't think I be coming back again. We arrive at 2 pm and A/C at the room wasn't working there properly and started leaking water badly. Technician came and supposedly have fix it. Came back at night and A/C was ok but started giving loud leaking noise in the middle of the night and was not cold at all after 3 am which I put up with. Inform reception the next morning before I went out, came back A/C was much colder but floor was dirty. It seems technician didn't bother to clean up his mess. Tried coffee machine wasn't working. Went to the club lounge to get coffee, was told that I can 't bring it back to my room. Explained to the person working there that I had so many issues with the room, my coffee machine in the room did not work & I need to check out in 30 minutes time and just wanted a cup of coffee.  She just kept asking room number. Seriously????"
"Upon checked in, front desk person requested to take down credit card detail. That I refused immediately as this pose security risk. 
Front desk charged to block 1 mil idr as guarantee that will be reverse upon check out. Then only to realised this amount cannot be used until the bank release which may take up to 1 Mth. 
I explained that this is a very abnormal practice. Where in other hotels it's not charged at all. The credit card is just opened as a guarantee without blocking any amount. This is very bad practice as their guest card are blocked for the amount even after checked out. 
Front desk staff insisting that this must be done at a rude manners. 
One of the worst hotel reception staff I ever met"
Not a wise choice
"I stayed at the watermark hotel from 23th to 26th. but on the 25th and 26th during breakfast. iron chips come out of fried rice. and on the 26th. iron chips  came out of fried eggs again. 
again and again. 
really tnis is a hotel I would never want to again.
worst hotel ever refinitely not a hotel 
I would recommend."
"The breakfast price of 35 dollars is very poor, only rice and noodles are not many choices, the staff service is very poor, Indonesian-style management, politely refuse all your needs or politely tell you that he doesn't want to do it, downgrade your room for no reason  level, just to make more money."
They are nor considerate and gave forgot about our booking. So disappointed
"A friend and I spent 2 nights here to end our 10 day trip to bali, and we were not disappointed. Throughout our stay in bali, we had stayed in nice but budget hotels and then we decided to check into Watermark for the last 2 nights as we thought it would be a bit of a treat. And it surely was! We didnt even pay that much, $85 AUD per night including breakfast for 2 people! (so it only ended up being just over $40 pp per night) and it was worth it! When we arrived at the hotel, we were welcomed so warmly by the staff who took great care of us and explained everything about the hotel and helped us to our rooms. They also explained to us various shuttle busses that we could take to Kuta and shopping centres for free and also organised our airport transfer (free as well!). So the staff really were great!
The pools were lovely too! The rooftop one has awesome views and is great to take pictures and relax and laze, however it is quite a shallow pool (1m) so cant really do diving haha, but great to relax!
The bottom floor pool was also lovely, a bit bigger and there is also a baby pool next to it. 
The breakfasts were great! We tried both the Japanese breakfast and the international buffet breakfasts and both were fantastic! 
Oh and the room! The room was amazing! And really big as well! the bathroom was fancy and we always got lots of hotel amenities. The room itself was a great place to hangout as it was spacious and had a very big couch next to the window. 
Theres also a gym that was good. 
The location isnt bad, especially if youre at the end of your trip waiting for your flight, however theres not an awful lot to do around Jimbaran. The beach was 20 minute walk from the hotel, however, the beach wasn't nice, lots and lots of rubbish from the ocean. But the restauarants along the beach was very nice! And there's a great Warung (Bloem's Warung) just across the street from the hotel which we ate at twice! Really good food for cheap prices! 
Its around a 40 minute d"
"What we liked: we booked a Suite room, more expensive but worth it. Extra bonuses included access to the suite lounge club with unlimited snacks and hot/cold drinks, late check-out, and free shuttles to Seminyak, Kuta, and beach. We arrived early and our room was already available which was a welcome surprise. The room was spacious, modern, well-equipped with a Nespresso coffee machine, water cooler, and quality toiletries. Spacious balcony with sunbed. Inexpensive cocktails by the pool (70K nett for 2) and the restaurant (Senses) was good and reasonably priced. Decent exchange rate money changer in the lobby, same as at banks. Beach towels provided. Staff in Bali are always friendly but the staff at Watermark were particularly helpful and genuinely interested.
What could be improved: breakfast buffet on cheap side. Mattress on raised pedestal, 1 foot above floor, hazard in the dark. Location offers limited eatery choices and no bars or shops nearby. Only one spa across the road."
"we, and our families, including 13 people stayed at Watermark Hotel for 3 nights. Watermark is great, exceed our expectation! First, the staff waited us at the airport, providing the shuttle services. Staffs are nice and helpful. Also, the hotel is clean, and have a big room. Gym room is good and there are two types of breakfast can be choose! Its really nice for the breakfast!!

I will choose to stay in Watermark if go to Bali again."
"Watermark Hotel only 10 minutes drive from the Airport (if there is no traffic jam, due to completion underpass work)
The hotel facade itself is very appealing, clean look and comfortable.
The room is spacious, the bed is good, the shower area is great..
for the price offered, it's a best deal
Breakfast is standard; we were staying for 3 nights this time, once we get bored with the menu selection from the breakfast menu, we can always buy a takeaway from near shops
Excellent Hotel :)"
"I chose Watermark as my last stop in Bali and it turned out to be extraordinary. The room is clean and the staff are all very helpful. You can book a shuttle bus to Kuta beach in advance and this is convenient to people like me who wants to go shopping. Also they provide airport shuttle bus. Save a lot of trouble. They offer breakfast in two styles, Japanese and western/local. I chose the latter one and it was good. Limited choices but definitely enough. They cook amazing Indonesian style noodles. 
I will choose Watermark again for its good service."
"We booked the  suite room as recommended by other travellers on Agoda. We were given complimentry airport transfers(free if you book it 24hours earlier).When we arrived at Bali our driver was at the airport with a watermark signboard waiting patiently for us(God bless him).we were 2hours late due to Airasia flight delay from KL and a long queue at immigration. The journey frm airport to hotel was only 7minutes it is the perfect Airport hotel cz it has an airport lounge.When we arrived we were greeted and served welcome drinks &cold towel by staff Bimbing who was  very helpful. I had initially booked the room for two adults .He said it was ok for our group 3adults to share the large suite but we have to add 300k rupiah for breakfast for the extra adult for 2 days.
Realy worth it for the price we paid we got a huge room with two queen size beds & complimentary breakfast.The italian breakfast spread was good. there is two swimming pools both rarely used so i basicly had the pool to mysel"
"The room we stayed in was the Superior room. The room had a huge King sized bed, had a bathtub and it was very clean. :) 
Staff over there would always greet you with a smile when they see you and it really made my day! 
Breakfast buffet provided by the hotel could be improved to have more variety daily. 
Hotel location was alright, there are a lot of warungs and convenience stores nearby the hotel. 
Overall, I enjoyed my stay here at Watermark Hotel!"
"Arrived at the hotel and being welcomed by the Japanese manager, went straight to the suite lounge and we were allowed to checked in immediately, only 5 mins of waiting and we could go into our rooms. Pretty fast check in progress compared to other hotels I've stayed in Bali. One thing that disturbs me the most was the NO-soundproofing in the room. Since the hotel is nearby the airport we could hear the airplane take off and landing sounds, very loudly, plus when people walk by the hotel corridor, we heard the footsteps, the noises. Other than that, breakfast, hotel facilities, staffs, services, transportation, were really great. Hope Watermark Hotel can improve so that next time I go to Bali, I may consider to stay in this hotel again."
"I always appreciate a prompt free airport pickup and return and free breakfast as well as safe, comfortable lodging.  The Watermark lacks nothing and is only 10 minutes away from the airport.  This will be my new airport hotel in Bali.  Hot pot in room as well as every amenity necessary are also appreciated."
"We stayed  1 night in this hotel and booked suite room. The room's clean and spacious. There're 2 queen beds and 1 sofa and mini pantry. We were allowed to access the lounge, mini snacks and various of drinks were available. The highlight was the breakfast in Japanese Restaurant (Imadoki), the dishes were mouth watering. Two thumbs up for Watermark Hotel. We will definitely come back soon :)"
"The design of the room is good, clean & comfortable. Room had been specially decorated (both bed & bath tubs) as requested, to kick start our Bali Trip. 
All the facilities & amenities are being maintained well. Both roof top pool (well design & decorated and you can watch SUNSET from here) & main pool are good (water not that clear?). The small souvenir & convenient shop is maintained well. A cafe worth to visit too. The lobby is comfortable, while waiting for our driver. 
Security is strict for every incoming vehicles. Nearby has all the marts (more than 4 diff marts & mini marts) in walking distance. Very near to Jimbaran beach, less time spent for traveling to there. It's not near to all those shopping area like Kuta, but you can have a peaceful stay here, although the traffic is still heavy?)
The buffet-style breakfast i can give 10/10, good food, varieties & environment.  
I'm happy & satisfied, will stay here again for my next visit."
We really had a great stay in Watermark Hotel. The staffs are all accommodating and hospitable. They are always there to help and grat your requests. The hotel is very clean. The breakfast is superb both Japanese ala carte and the other restaurant buffet breakfast. This hotel is really recommended. Thank you Watermark! I had a great birthday celebration. Salute!
"We really enjoy our holiday staying at watermark suite room.. the room is clean and so big.. i put a note for romantic holiday when booking by agoda and they prepare the room with 2 birds and rose petal in the big bed and also prepare the bath with rose petal.. really love it! Feels like a second honeymoon ♡♡ in the suite room they also provide coffee maker with dulce gusto! We love the room, the pool view, the outdoor bed.. really recommended for family holiday also! Thank you watermark for making our holiday so great!"
"The hotel is quite new, just about a year old. We picked the Suite room, its quite huge and with the facilities it has to offered its really worth it. The only thing dissapoint us is the smell of the wood from the room, probably because the floor and the interior is mostly covered by wood. Swimming pool is quite small too, there's no swimming pool for kids as well. This hotel is very close to many local activities, close to Jimbaran seafood or other local culinaries. Kuta is around 20 mins drive from here. Airport is just 10 minutes away. The staff is super friendly and helpful . I would recommend if you're on a budget and looking for a convenient place to stay, pick this hotel. They have a Japanese restaurant which is quite good too."
"We stayed at the Club Watermark Suite, the room is spacious and clean, the club lounge is a plus. Very friendly staff, they provide free shuttles to Kuta Beach and Jimbaran Beach. The breakfast is great full of selections. Value of money!!"
"After staying in a Villa for 5 Days we just needed an extra night as we had a mix up with the flights. We had seen this being built a few months earlier and as Jimbaran is our preferred location it was a good time to try it. We upgraded to a Balcony Suite thinking there were Ocean views but it's further from the coast than anticipated. The Room is excellent value Bed is enormous Coffee Machine and Microwave is a bonus and decent sized Balcony with Day Bed. Very well laid out and very clean. Pool is not very inviting and Gardens need attention. We didn't make it to the Roof top pool as the Room was so comfy we hardly left. Breakfast was a total Fail and needs drastic improvement. The big positive for this Hotel is the Departure Lounge which is very comfortable and convenient with Showers, Charge points for Electronics and the lounge could quite easily be a comfy bed. I would highly recommend for the business traveler or as a stopover if you are a regular Bali shopper who knows where to go etc."
"This time we stayed at suite room type. The space is enormous. I couldn't imagine this price with the space. The bed is combined with 2 ""king-size "" bed, it's more than enough for even 4 people. The location is in jimbaran, but it's so easy if you wanna  go famous jimbaran seafood area, or if you wanna go kuta area. Around the area, there's nuri's  warung, or you can go a bit further to new plaza called Samasta, which is along with Movenpick hotel. This hotel is just a place you won't want to miss."
"Was originally only staying 2 nights at Watermark Hotel, but suite room so nice, beds very comfortable, staff so welcoming, location and food selection so great, decided to stay our last 5 days here"
"Second time in the hotel.  Very pleased with service, performance, value. This time, had a plumbing problem in the bathroom with sewage odor and leaking pipe, but was immediately relocated to a new room on request. Hotel restaurant is exceptional in terms of quality and value. Likely more reasonable than others of similar quality in tourist areas. Stay away from the beachfront fish restaurant that is serviced by the hotel shuttle cart. Rip-off tourist joint on the dirty Jimbaran beach.  Rent a scooter and drive yourself to the nice beach clubs on Uluwatu."
"We stay for 6 nights in here because of Mt. Agung eruption. Still same as our earlier stay in here : room is clean, staffs are very helpful and kind (especially Ms. Yuni who help us a lot), service is excellent and complete facilities.. this hotel has shuttle to beachwalk and to restaurant in Jimbaran beach, where you can also play in the beach.. The location is a little far from crowd (not that far) but reachable by taxi, so it’s kinda okay.. We love this hotel and definitely will come back again.."
"Come back to this hotel again after the airport close down, the staff greet us with smile and a ""welcome back"". Always nice when you get acknowledge as their previous guest. This hotel is not in the crowded district, but everything that you need is just nearby. Well done watermark!"
Chill luxurious hotel with a wonderfull staff. But the location is a little bit far from most places. But with taxi or motorcycle it's definitely doable
Best for family with kids
"Located in Jimbaran, to reach the beach seafd resto behind need a lil bit of walk thru small dark lane, the room is excellent and very cozy. In front of htl there is a famous babi guling resto, reccommended. Overall it was a nice stay."
"The area of the hotel is strategic. It nears some convenience store and some famous places to eat.
Some facilities are old like the room and the pool,but its okay. The room is extreemly huge, the bed is huge also. But neet to pay extra charge 150k/ child. The breakfast is standard, some stand is empty and need sometime to refil. Can be improved."
Need to improve breakfast menu and air circulation in the resto.
The room was big but too close to the main street. Its a bit noisy at night. But the staff let us change the room to more quiet one
"WE stayed at The suite Room for 3 person . Need tO pay additional rp 200.000,- for towel n breakfast .

bad attitude staff
Really nice hotel and great staff. Nice rooms and centrally located. Good food options and a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant on site with very good ramen and sushi.
beautiful room with nice food and helpful staff.
"Great location but not really satisfied with the bathroom. It is always stinky especially at night. 
The room spaces was big and so with the bed. We have two queenbed joining as one so that really give us a space to sleep with two children together."

nive enough. breakfast wasn't very good though
"Big room big bed , near the airport"
Stuff are so friendly.Breakfast is delicious.Room is big and clean.
"The Good:
- Hotel staff are friendly and always greet us with their smiles.
- Staff are accommodating with our request to switch room.
- Hotel is near airport.
The Bad:
- Soundproofing of the hotel is really bad. We can hear dogs barking from the adjacent buildings very clearly in the middle of the night and we understand this might be fairly common in Bali. You can also hear the footsteps and chattering of other guests along the corridor. You will also hear the neighbouring unit whenever they turn the switches on. 
- In our room, there was a lizard in the toilet. 
- Toilet taps and rain shower head has a lot of scratches and stains which makes it looks like it is very worn out. However staff does explained that it was due to used of incompatible cleaning chemicals. 
- There are algae behind the bathtub 
- The rain shower pressure is very low, which doesn’t give you a good showering experience."
"We stayed at the pool suite and let me tell you it was worth every penny! The hotel staff tried their best to accommodate our requests however last minute and even on a last minute run to the airport to catch our flight, we left one of our passports in the car and the driver ZOOMED back to the airport despite the heavy traffic , bless his heart. Would definitely come back ♡"
"Rooms need a facelift, Room 235 wooden floor need a lot of attention along with the shower area as you cant get the water out  :("
I wud recommend it for d family .Great place to rewind.
