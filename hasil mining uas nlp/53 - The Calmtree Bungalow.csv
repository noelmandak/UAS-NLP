"Villa is very beautiful. Bedroom is small but has extended living room terrace. Private pool and outdoor shower makes it just even better. Staff is wonderful, 24h available. Location is superb, in main area Canggu, but on a side alley and inside  just a tranquil peaceful garden. Highly recommend if you want to be near shops and restaurants and still enjoy peace. Btw Warung BuMi is almost next door and gas amazing Indonesian food with lots of choice, for crazy low price."
"The best place i have stayed in canggu, nice and clean. Mold free! Great staff and located very central in Batu bolong. Toiletries were super nice. Would stay again"
"Lovely staff, clean and comfortable bungalow in the heart of canggu. Brand new AC and hot showers with great water pressure make your stay super enjoyable. Can’t recommend enough!"
"We had a lovely 7 nights long stay at The Calmtree Bungalow, the rooms are cozy, the place is secluded at the end of a little alley, away from the road, the pool is nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful. 
Wifi is not the best, and breakfasts were just OK, but everything else we loved and it’s great value for the price. We will come back!"
"I loved it, wish i knew about this place a lot earlier. Everything is perfect, location, bungalow, outdoor shower, day bed, pool, landscape, etc. It is a very good value now due to travel limitations."
Loved the place so we extended our stay.
"2th time we’ve been here, de apartments/huts are the best, people are super kind."
Really enjoyed my stay here. Was nice and relaxing. Great staff . Always more than happy to help when asking about area. Would highly recommend and the pool is always great .
"I booked a private pool villa and it includes breakfast for 2 on the details. I spend 3 nights and got no breakfast at all. I already complained to some staff, he's apologized and then he said he will send the breakfast to our room tomorrow morning.. but there's nothing change on the third day, the breakfast never came to our room till our last day 🙂 
However, the private pool villa was quite big enough for my family and the pool was very clean as well. But sometimes it's so hard to park my car outside, the road and the parking space were so small and almost always full. It's just fit only for 3 cars and the rest space already taken by all motorcycles.
There's no staff or security on the front gate while it was raining so hard. They should be there to stand by to help the guest and take them to the room with umbrella. I'm running to my villa from the parking area while holding my baby, and it was raining so hard! And the one who helped me to hold my things to my villa while it rain so hard at that time was one of the guest, complaining the same thing."
"Unfortunately during these tough times when rooms don't get used often they need to be cleaned regularly. Bedding was dusty, and was awoken by rats in the bungalow during the night which unfortunately led to the room stinking of rat urine by the morning."
My Partner and I stayed 3 nights at the Calm Tree Bungalows. The Bungalow was nice and clean and with a cute porch facing the pool (like all the Bungalows do). The Bungalows are hidden down a side street to one of the main roads in Canggu. You can walk to the beach and to all the cool restaurants and shops in the area. The staff was extremely helpful and made our stay a breeze. They helped us arrange surf lessons and booked a car that we took for a day-trip to Ubud. Would stay here again if we go back to Canggu. Thank you Calmtree Bungalows for a lovely stay!
"We had a lovely stay @ the calmtree. Cool styles bungalows, small but very nice and clean pool. Staff amazingly helpful. Breakfast preatty small portion but it was enough in the morning. Unfortunately no dining option but we didn't worried about because just cross the road, fantastic selection of food available. Peaceful and relaxing stay. We rented even a scooter in the hotel, it was so handy. Beach is very close and great for learners. Will be back again if next time stay in Canggu."
"if you go to Canggu in Bali I would definitely recommend staying here. the private bungalows are close to bars and restaurants and the beach but set back from the main road so it's very peaceful.  the garden seeing and pool are really nice too.
We only stayed 2 nights and arrived very late the first night but this was no problem as they have 24 hour reception!  
This  was our first stop on our own little tour of Bali  and the staff arranged all of onward transfers and boat connections to Nusa Lembognan and the Gillis and got us a great deal.
Really recommended. Would definitely visit again."
"It met my expectations. It's only 7 minutes walking to Batu Bolong Beach..  We loved the bungalow & the comfortable big beds! The staff were friendly, thanks for the welcome drink; fresh watermelon juice & tropical fruits. We love the breakfast, it was decent. The pool was small but Great!! We really enjoyed our stay in Calmtree Bungalow! Thank u! We'll be back!"
Calmtree Bungalow is a wonderful little bungalow hotel run by very friendly and helpful staff. Its so quiet and relaxing and excellent value for money. The breakfast choice is small and cooked to order but we felt it was enough for what we needed. Otherwise the amazing Bettlenut Cafe is just next door. Its about 10-15 minute walk from the beach. Scooters can be rented with help from the hotel at a very cheap rate and traffic is Canggu is very calm. The bungalows are very clean and have a big outdoor bathroom. The only negative thing about the place is that there are very many mosquitos. If you are the kind that gets eaten to bits - this place may not be for you.
The Calmtree Bungalows are are perfect little hideaway in Canggu with excellent service and a good restaurant. The breakfast is all you could wish for
"Our Stay at Calmtree was the highlight of our 4 week stay in Bali.  Our children loved the pool whilst my husband and I could chill out on the deck watching them play in the pool. The food was excellent and so was that of the staff especially Gusti.
Would recommend this hotel/resort and would stay again!"
"We loved the Calmtree Bungalows and would go back again.the staff were fantastic,food yummy, rooms clean and the pool peaceful and quiet,we enjoyed every minute of our stay ."
"It is exactly what is promises: calmness, trees and beautiful cottages :). Made me feel like a princess in my own little castle (which is basic but clean and comfortable). And showering outdoors under the sun or stars is bliss...
Staff is very friendly and helpful.

Location is great, in the centre of Canggu and 500 metres walk to the beach, close to the Practise yoga school. For light, early sleepers: keep in mind that Deus is just a few hundred metres away..

Little suggestions for improvement: providing mineral water for free, and personally I like buffet style breakfast more than a la carte.  I it nice, but I had a second breakfast in town though after some time.

The property is not so big, the bungalows are quiet close to each other and all facing the pool (which is great!), if you need a lot of privacy this can be challenging, especially during high season."
"This place is beautiful, a gem! The staff were so friendly and always around to help if you needed. Location was perfect and the best bit for us was the peacefulness and tranquility - only the sound of the trickling water from the pool and chirping birds, and somehow no scooter tooting could be heard! It was super clean, with only a fallen frangipane petal or 2 decorating the ground. 4.9 stars from us - the only thing we would comment is that the shower was very weak, but that literally was the only thing! Thanks Calmtree!"
"At first I was hesitant to book because the bungalow doesn't have AC. But it turn out really nice because the bungalow got windows from every direction, so we can just leave the window open at night while sleeping. Internet connection was top notch. The best I had in Bali. The bed was wonderful and beautifully arranged with mosquito net which was essential for you to sleep at night. Power terminals were everywhere in the room and veranda, so you can just plug your gadget's charger everywhere. It was wonderful stay."
"The hotel is just as in the pictures, it is picturesque and peaceful.  It is walking distance from the beach, the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly.  The food served from the kitchen was great value, fresh and tasty.  Breakfast had about 5 options and the juices were delicious and cheap.  The pool was clean, as were the rooms and the man who cleaned the rooms daily did a great job.  This was as good as any 4 star hotel, if you can handle no air-conditioning.  It didn't bother us as it was December and once we mastered the fan under the mosquito net.  We would definitely stay here again if we ever returned to Bali."
"Beautiful bungalows with a real rustic feel. Whilst there was no aircon, it really didnt matter. The mozzie nets and fans were good enough for the time we were there (March).
Gedye, Gusti and Andre made us feel very welcome and the intimate nature of the bungalows allowed adequate privacy and very acceptable accommodation for the price. Its not the hyatt but for us it was much better. Small, welcoming and close to a huge range of organic eating places with a 10 minute stroll to the beach - Bagus!!"
"Just a divine little haven with a big dose of traditional bali style accommodation. Incredibly clean and neat with a beautiful garden and refreshing clean pool. Sweet outdoor bathrooms and beds with clean hole free mosquito nets, comfy lounges on the verandahs and quiet peaceful surrounds.A 15 minute walk to the beach and 2 minute walk to a very yummy health conscious raw food eatery with views across a rice paddy and if you want a night out with the laid back surfing masses go to Deus a 5 minute walk away to remind yourself of the busy lifestyle you may have been missing. All fun and around a 40 minute drive to the airport all of which can be happily organized through reception."
"Beautiful bungalows in tropical garden setting around pool.
Right next to best cafe in canggu betanut as well as other eat spots and shopping. Not too far from beach."
"A beatiful and calm spot in the middle of busy canggu. The pool and the garden is just perfekt, the rooms are big and the breakfast and staff are so nice.
We got more than we expected!"
"Absolutely loved our stay here. Such a beautiful and serene atmosphere. Very friendly staff and great location in Canggu. Only thing that was a little gross our pillows smelled horrible, like body odor and sweat, so was not very comfortable getting into bed. But I know little things like this come with budget stay. Would 100% stay again"
"We came back to Bali and for sure we came back to Calm Tree Bungalows. If I come back to Bali, I won't doubt to spend a few days here in Calm Tree."
"Really can’t say enough about this place - it’s lovely. Picturesque pool surrounded by bungalows. To be clear, the bungalows are basic, and just perfect. No TV, no AC it’s all about relaxing. Real coffee in the AM and walkable to beach and a ton of neat restaurants. Staff are lovely."
"Our stay at the Camtree bungalow was amazing. It was in the perfect location, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the cabin/treehouses were adorable. I hate AC so having a breeze and a fan was the best experience. They were large and I really enjoyed hanging out on the front terrace. I will definitely stay here again."
Made & Gusti made sure they knew guests by name and everyone was friendly throughout my stay. Convenient location and comfortable room. I am very grateful I get to refill my water so I did not need to contribute to plastic waste by buying. Totally enjoyed staying here and would recommend to anyone.
"I stayed 1 week in one of the two Pool villas and I enjoyed it very much. Privacy, very nice room and Pool.
The staff is very friendly.
It is 50m from the main road and 10-15min from the beach.
Canggu is a very busy area with 1 Million motorbikes, hard to cross the road. Many crowded and not so good Restaurants. When you reach the beach, nice walk for miles, not crowded."
"We really loved our stay, even if it was just one night. We felt at home in our hut and the staff's hospitality were on another level."
"Room is clean and spacious, staffs are nice, good location and reasonable price."
Had a lovely night but we were only passing through and really wished we could have stayed longer. Hope to return.
"Love this place but too many mosquitoes. 
Still prefer a hotel with the aircon."
"Very nice & quite location but still well located. 10-15mins walk to the beach.
The staff is helpful and friendly"
Loved this place!
we decided not to stay because the available room was not as good as the one shown in the images...
"Bungalow was awesome. Food and staff were great. Lovely pool. Good location. Taxi found it a bit hard to find, but we got there."
"Nice bungalow and bathroom. Comfortable stay. Beautiful environment.
Nice breakfast
Friendly staff.
Only down fall is bed and pillows were not too comfortable"
Highly recommended
"Beautiful little place. Great comfy day bed on each bungalow verandah to laze around and read a book. Reception staff were nice. No aircon but we were only a bit hot 2 nights when we first went to bed. Fan was usually adequate. Breakfast freshly cooked and nice enough. Loved the outdoor bathroom and showering in the rain! Only complaint is there was construction being done on the building behind our bungalow. There were tarps up to stop anyone looking, but it's a bit unnerving sitting on the toilet or showering when there is a worker behind a tarp a metre or two away!"
"The most peaceful and relaxing place, you could spend all day there easily. The pool is great, the food is tasty, and the staff are the best. Would go back ?"
Such a cute place and the best free breakfast I've ever had anywhere on my travels!!!
"Best bungalows in the whole of Changgu. Simple yet clean. No AC, but that comes with the package. We love it."
Only con was the tax charged on something as simple as a cup of tea.
Location is great and staff are very helpful
"It's really wonderful experience!The hotel settle down on the bolong road near the beach.Everything is so convinent,there are lots bar and famous delicious restaurant around it."
A very nice place.
What a hidden little oasis. It's great for the budget conscious traveller.
Great bungalow compound with perfect pool. Down a quiet side street but only a short distance to lots of bars and restaurants. Ten minute walk to the beach.  Very nice staff. Highly recommend.
"Good location & Good Staff,  Food & Drink At Cafe is Nice.  
And very Calm place"
"Beautiful, clean and practical. Staff very nice and friendly... very very good experience!!!"
"close to beach, just behind various restaurants and cafe's"
They were work under progress so it was noisy. Location is good as close from beach. Clean. Won't go back.
"Great little place, the only thing I worry about is the open air-space above the doorways and other places allowing all types of creepy crawlies to come for a visit. A simple installation of fly-wire or netting in these spaces would prevent this. Although I didn't get any major surprises I did get bitten by a couple of mozzies. No probs for me but I wouldn't want to bring my 1 year old."
"Highly recommended, great location in Canggu."
Really loved this place. So tranquil and sweet. Great location and good wifi and we didn't find it too hot at night.
Very pleasant and relaxed. I enjoyed my stay very much. I'd recommend it to anyone!
Little gem in canggu. Very peaceful and lovely people. Good breakfast with good coffee! Would recommend highly!!!
good  staf.  food. and scenery
We arrived late in the evening with a toddler. The signboard was not very visible cauzing the taxi driver difficulty to locate it. Otherwise the stay was very pleasant. Welcoming and helpful staff in particular Gusti. They managed to cater to our vegetarian meals. Something very cozy and homely about this place. The pool was clean and well kept. Beatiful landscaping nice to just sit and savour the beauty.Located close to other eateries as well.  Overall a pleasant stay i dont mind visiting again.
"It was a wonderful experience, gede and his team were always exceptional friendly and helpful! The place is made with love and I will for sure come back! 
Thank you Gede and of course your great team!"

"It was cute, comfortable, pretty, clean with lovely gardens and small pool with a good choice of breakfast options. No fridge though and open to mosquitoes.  Get a scooter when you get there."
"Very relaxing stay in the little cottages amongst the beautifully designed gardens. No aircon but felt safe to leave a window open and fans were provided. The pool area is stunning. Disappointed to find no bottled water in the rooms and no tea and coffee making facilities. Bottled water was available for purchase at the cafe/reception area. This place is located in behind Betelnut cafe which has such good food, we ate most of our meals there!"
"I stay at this bungalow or always recommend if one of my friend wants to visit Bali if they wanna experience outdoor feeling with cute atmosphere without breaking your wallet. 
The location is excellent, tons of cute cafes and walking distance to the beach. 
The cafeteria was updated and has more menu. 
Love this place."
"Friendly staff, convinient location with restaurant and massage.
Value for money."
Fantastic

Wonderful boutique hotel with authentic Balinese atmosphere.
"Amazing, very relaxing, nice place. Got a nice welcome drink, good value for money, good coffee"

"Friendly staff, beautiful bungalow, relaxed pool"
"This hotel is in a great location right next to Monsieur Spoon (yum!) Deus (yum!) and Beetlenut (yum!) the hotel itself is very comfortable with relaxing surroundings, nice pool and walking distance to the beach :)"
"Place is clean.. Small & quiet.. Motorbike or car rental service available. 
The staff (Nita) was very helpful & concern about us and our safety as when we wanted to ride a bike to Seminyak at night., she insist for us to hire a car as she was very worried of our safety.  It feels like home."
Do happy with our stay here. Loved everything about it. The bungalows were just devine as was the pool area and entire place. Best accommodation I've stayed in and I've been to over 40 countries. So happy I chose this quaint resort...
Excellent
"We had an amazing stay. There a beautiful Bali style rooms, the pool is lovely and the staff are great. Lots of great restaurants very close. Nice and quiet spot to stay with just a 10 minute stroll to the beach."
"I stayed for 4 days and it was really great. I had to be very smart about avoiding mosquitos at night but that is what you need to do when you are staying in a ""bungalow."" The breakfast was great and the staff was very helpful to organize my taxi rides and other recommendations about the area throughout my stay. I already miss taking shower under the stars."
"OBSESSED! I am a frequent guest and when my Mom came to visit me, staying anywhere else was not an option! She loved the tropical bungalows and how close they each are to the pool. The staff is friendly and attentive 24/7. Easy access to Echo Beach, Batu Bolong, and Berawa. Tanah Lot and Seminyak are both only short drives away."
"I have booked this hotel for my parents and their friend, all said great expirence, so I gave 10"
"New resort in canggu about 10 minutes walk to pantai batu bolong and 15 minutes walk echo beach. Surf beaches. Love the layout hotel and very nice atmosphere, about 8 bungalows and well kept. Every bungalow made of bamboo has outside bathroom which are nice when it's at noon but when it's at nite I got tprobleem with Mosquitos. no airco, no tv and no fridge."
"We really enjoyed staying at the calm tree bungalows, it had a very friendly atmosphere and we felt comfortable staying there. Not too far from the beach."
"Overall good and for sure value for money. It was more far from the beach then expected and the noise of motorcycles racing in the night on the road close by, was anoying"
"overall the stay was good. Great pool view. Small but clean room. Staffs were friendly and attentive too and fluent in english. Breakfast was simple but nice. The only comment is that the room would be perfect if it was equipped with air-conditional. Mosquito repellent was provided, however it didn't help much."
very       nice        and       people         so       kind     and     helpful
"Lovely rooms, pool, people and surroundings. We will definitely be coming back to stay and would highly recommend it to everyone."
"Desayuno brutal!! bungalows muy xulos, empleados muy atentos y una piscina perfecta :)"
"Un lugar preciosos, muy bien cuidado, con un personal muy amable y atento. Las Cabañas son preciosas, están muy  limpias  y parecen de cuento."
"Es la segunda vez que visitamos Bali y no teníamos ninguna duda de que queríamos quedarnos en estos bungalows. Están muy bien, los trabajadores son encantadores y han mejorado el desayuno.
Esta vez las sábanas no estaban tan limpias tenían algunas manchas de esas q no salen pero olían a lavadas...aparte de eso lo demás genial."
Écrin de verdure et de calme à 50m du tumulte de la rue de la plage. Plein de Warung tout autour. Les huttes sont juste magnifiques. Personnel charmant. Super adresse.
"Charmant bungalow, bon emplacement, personnel sympathique restaurant excellent"
Le lieu est mignon. L'equipement et la déco des bungalows y sont par contre très basiques. Evitez de prendre les bungalows du fond proche du bar.
"Nous avons passé 4 nuits au Calmtree Bungalow. Cet hôtel est absolument merveilleux. Il est très bien entretenu, les bungalows sont très propres avec une belle salle de bain en extérieur. Le personnel est adorable. On y mange très bien et les prix sont très corrects. Le jardin et la piscine sont magnifiques. L'endroit est idéal pour se reposer et profiter."
"Au calmtree bungalows on est à pas tout à fait à l'hôtel, pas tout à fait dans une chambre d'hôte. Le personnel est souriant, prévenant, il n'est pas intrusif et est pro, au rythme balinais. Les bungalows sont confortables et très mignons, le rapport qualité, esthétique, accueil et prix est excellent. On loue les scooters sur place en quelques minutes on est sur la plage. A quelques mètres du concept store Deus ex machina, c'est un vrai plus pour les animations très sympas, le restau aussi."
"Un hotel calme, joli, sympa, excellentissime rapport qualité/ prix et accueil. Très honnêtes et sourire balinais garantis"
"Calmtree bungalow est un endroit très agréable, calme, jolie déco, un accueil très sympa. Situé à côté de Echo beach, de Deus ex machina au milieu des rizières de Canggu. Un endroit où l'on se sent bien, charmant, tout en bois"
"NOus avons adoré notre séjour de 3 nuits au calmtree hotel. Nous étions 4, dans un bungalow. Le rapport qualité/ prix est excellent. Il est situé près de echo beach, plage de surfeurs et à côté de seminyak mais loin de la foule. Proche de Tanah lot."
sehr tolle kleine Anlage mit super freundlichem personal
"Wunderschöne Anlage mit Pool, guten Frühstück, angenehme Zimmer mit sauberem Bad - wichtig beim Bett war ein Moskitonetz! 10 min zu Fuß zum Strand zu den Bars und Surfing Spots. 
Wirklich empfehlenswert!"
"Die Anlage ist eher klein, liegt ca. 500m vom Strand entfernt, in der Nähe sind zahlreiche nette Lokale und Wahrungs. Die Bungalows sind im traditionellen balinesischen Stil gebaucht, weshalb sie auch ohne Klimaanlage wunderschön luftig und kühl sind. Das Pool war klein aber fein. Das Frühstück definitiv das Beste, das wir in unserem ganzen Urlaub gegessen haben. Leider haben wir nur eine Nacht in der tollen Anlage verbracht. Jederzeit wieder, dann aber für mehr als 1 Nacht!"
"Sehr freundliches Personal, schöner Pool und super Frühstück inklusive. Die Unterkunft ist sehr sauber und ruhig obwohl ganz Nah an allen Restaurants und Geschäften."
"Sehr entspannter Aufenthalt. Nicht nur für die Kids War der Pool das Highlight. Zentrale Lage, Scooter dennoch empfehlenswert."
"Das Calmtree war die erste Unterkunft auf unserer Bali-Lombok-Reise und wurden nicht enttäuscht. Nette Mitarbeiter, schöne Bungalows, cooler Pool...Essen war sehr lecker, Mitarbeiter immer hilfsbereit, alles war sauber und gepflegt...wir würden auf jedenfall wiederkommen...Dankeschön ;)"
"Die kleine Bungalowanlage ist ein absolutes Juwel in Canguu. Der Garten ist WUNDERSCHÖN, der Pool sauber und erfrischend. Das Frühstück war mehr als lecker und auf jeden Fall ausreichend. (Fresh fruit, sandwiched, jaffles, etc). Das Personal ist mehr als hilfsbereit und ausserdem lustig. 😊 Die Lage ist ebenfalls sehr gut, 10 Min zu Fuss zum Strand runterm super Lokale in direktrr Nähe.
Preis/Leistung - Topppp!!!!"


"Mooie bungalows
Helaas wel open dus veel last van muggen
Een buiten badkamer, itneressant.
Personeel was top. Ontbijt heerlijk."

"We hebben genoten van the Calm Tree, fijn dat er twee aparte bedden boven waren. Goed ontbijt, ze verhuren fietsen en scooters zodat je binnen een paar minuten op t strand zit (echo beach is n aanrader). Kortom prima👍"
We hebben een leuk verblijf gehad. Als je daar bent heb je niet in de gaten dat je vlakbij de drukte zit.
"We hebben het erg naar ons zin gehad. Leuk opgezet met de huisjes rond het zwembad, heel gezellig. 
Enige nadeel is dat het park en de huisjes minder goed te bereiken zijn voor rolstoelen."
"Erg fijn hotel. Buiten alle drukte van seminyak en alles is gemakkelijk te doen met taxi. Strand van changgu is niet zo mooi, leuk om te lunchen. Veel surfers actief bij changgu. Hotel is prachtig en goed onderhouden. Alles is schoon en personeel vriendelijk."
"夫婦と子供２人の４名で６人用ファミリーバンガローに３泊しました。
２階建てのバンガローでとても良かったです。
エアコン、ホットシャワー。シャワー、トイレは半野外です。
場所も便利で食事に行くのも徒歩で行けます。近くのフランス人オーナー？のムッシュスプーンは、クロワッサンやケーキがとても美味しく、何度か行きました。出て行くのが面倒でも、GRAB FOODやGO FOODのアプリで、沢山のお店のデリバリーできるので便利です。
プールも綺麗でとても快適に滞在できました。
ありがとうございましたヽ(^。^)ノ"
"駐車場が、とても狭かった。表の通りからの道も車幅一杯でした。
全体的には、こじんまりとして素晴らしいホテルです。"
"デウスから歩いていけます。他にも、有名なチャングーのカフェにアクセス良好です。ビーチも歩いていけます。バイクも1日５００円程度で借りられます。バンガローもとってもかわいいです。蚊がいるけど、そんなの気にしない！
いつもの定宿です。"

"나홀로여행객인데, 일반적으로 볼수 있는 호텔보다 발리 느낌나는 숙소를 찾고싶어서 선택했습니다. 인테리어도 좋고, 수영장 물도 깨끗하고, 단점은 화장실이 외부에 있어 가끔 아침에 죽은 벌레가 보이는 정도?, 그래도 이 가격에 이런숙소는 대만족입니다. 조식도 맛있어요 메뉴도 많고"
