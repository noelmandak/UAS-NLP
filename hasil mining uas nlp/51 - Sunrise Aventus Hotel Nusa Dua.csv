"First imoression to me , this hotel is New and clean. As i enter the lobby it smells good and the staff so nice. Even when i just parking my motorcycle the security come help me carry my luggage to the hotel lobby 
The hotel ia just in theiddle of u turn so"
"For those want hotel in budget with all amenities in kuta area , go for it .
The staff were very much welcoming, room service was good  and the hotel location is also on the main road"
Very friendly staff with welcome drink and cold towel on arrival. Made sure to address both of us by our names throughout our stay which shows they put in the effort. Very helpful throughout. Lovely room which was very clean and stylish. Excellent food in the rooftop restaurant with free sushi taster voucher included in our stay. 100% recommend this hotel.
"This hotel is very perfect staff ,perfect break fast ,perfect lobby , and perfect clean room at bali"
"There is less food around, and it is not very clean. The location of this place is not good, but the price is very cheap."
"Very clean hotel with the staff welcoming us with open arms. Staff are great and very helpful. The rooms were small but for the price it's what we expected. We had stayed in big way more expensive rooms and were going home so we just needed a bed for the last few
nights of our trip.  The buffet breakfast was the best of our whole trip. Well worth the $7.50 Australian. The choices and variety was exceptional.  There is also a good shop 2 doors up seing everything from clothes, food to tools. We will definitely be back and recommend the Sunrise Aventus to anyone staying in Nusa Dua."
It was a wonderful stay and the staff were very friendly and helpful! The place is nice and clean too!
After 3 weeks in rooms with bugs insdie an out an nice clean room with a strong shower was exactly what I needed. Around the corner from the immigration office so perfect if you don't live nearby and want to be there first thing in the morning.
"The staff is good, the cleaness is good, pirce is good for budget, location also good"
"Really love to stay in this hotel. 
Service was good. 
Got welcome drink, cool towel, fruits & snacks as compliments. 
Very clean & bright. 
Breakfast so tasty."
"Clean , efficient and nothing to complain"
"the room is clean, tidy and spacious. the staff also very nice and helpful. the minus things is the parking lot is outdoor and located next building. the swimming pool also located to outside area of hotel and we need to walk ab 5 min. the breakfast is not buffee, but you need to choose the menu and they will cook, so we need to wait quite sometimes.. but overall the hotel is nice and worth to stay"
"Location is close to beaches at South Kuta. Food is also available around the hotel or you can opt for selection of food on gofood or grab food apps. 
Hotel room is quite clean but not so sold on the bathroom, it was circular and pretty tight (it was still clean tho).
Pool water needs to be inspected regularly as kids got rashes after swimming.  Hotel staff were quick to respond to this complaint. 
Overall, it is a nice and comfortable hotel to stay in during our stay in Bali."
"I was really impressed with the staff here. Al of them were so kind and helpful. I got sick and had to stay longer than initially planned and they made sure I was taken care of. The rooms were clean and quiet. I’ve had a tough time finding quiet nights and this place was definitely a remedy. Great location close to everything in Nusa Dua. The pool was disappointing as it’s detached from the property and shared with housing units and was just average at best. Breakfast was only ok, though the restaurant has a beautiful view. Overall, highly recommend this place and great value for your money!"
"I has a very wonderful stay at Sunrise Aventus! The room and amenities are exceptional plus the very kind, warm and welcoming hotel staff. I will definitely be back!"
"Strategic location.  Near everywhere.  Clean rooms, comfortable beds.  The breakfast menu is varied and tastes ok.  Highly recommended"
"Fabulous stay! Good location, super friendly service, cleanliness on point, breakfast well served. Recommended!"
"love every extra little touch they put. welcome snacks and room is sanitized. staffs were really friendly, comfy pillows 👍"
"Excellent service, next to convenience stores and cafes"
"The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful 
Special thank you to Jaya housekeeping and Taufik and beautiful Lia also Kadek and Pasek for all their help 
Highly recommend and I will definitely stay again"
"Very clean, staff was so friendly and helpful, you should stay here. the breakfast also be companied by relaxing views, thank you!"
"basic room, clean and had a good fresh feel. the bathroom was a capsule which was different and cannot fault it. all in all for the value this was a steal, will recommend eyes closed. breakfast was excellent for the value (fresh eggs made) as per order along with indonesia food and some sushis."
"The best affordable hotel in Nusa Dua, all is good, the staff is good, and the meals are good too.
I always recommend this hotel to my friends!"
"We booked a residential 2 bedroom (townhouse). well maintained. had the basic amenities you need including kitchen. breakfast was included (fresh eggs and toast) along with indonesia food. cannot complain. water gallon provided which was a plus.
downside: No kitchen utensils ( no knives even). had to request for plates and cutlery which i believe should be included. had a washing machine (primitive) but did the job.
for the value, worth it. will recommend."
I love the place but... the pool is outside the hotel.
"Everything was perfect. Thank u all the staff, you are all amazing"
"Tiny room, but who cares when you go out to adventure! Bed were comfortable, everything cleaned everyday. The Hiromi restaurant on top is delicious!! For all meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner! The staff was really sweet and helpful. A bit far from everything, but GoJeks do the job for cheap!"
strategic location. Staff so friendly and helpful.
"Staffs were friendly, we got welcome drink and cool towel..room's bright,it's good for me..the room was clean, the foods for breakfast were awesome.."
Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place in Nusa Dua
"Easy to find, strategically located. Quite strange capsule bathroom but everything work just fine."
"The room is very clean and new. Nice and friendly stuffs, breakfast is good. It’s value for what you pay."
Everything was above our expectations
facilities at sunrise aventus is so perfect..
"thankyou staff super helpful and friendly, kamar bersih & lokasi strategis :)"
Over all good
Sangat puas
"It was a nice stay, comfortable, clean Property, the breakfast was good . I was in business trip to Bali, a nice good Hotel on the road head. I recommend the hotel, which is value for money."
"Very clean and modern hotel close to ulawatu ,nusa dua and toll bridge. friendly staff thank you."
"It is a good hotel , value for money. Room clean, staff helpful and smily. All facilities are close by."
All stuffs are great especially the house keepers
Worth every penny. Great location and Staff!
Good hotel👍
The room was small yet very functional. Overall it was clean and very comfortable. The location is perfect as it conveniently located close to some shops which are open 24 hours.
The hotel is very clean with very nice hospitality. Recommended hotel near Nusa Dua.
Very good experience 👏🏻👏🏻
So far so good. I will come back again
"Superb service from each staff,nice breakfast compared to similiar hotel around
But the bathroom was too slipery,a rubber mat would be great and pillow also too hard"
"the hotel is very clean, it's opened last Jan 2022, facilities are all new, the staff is fast -response. they have sushi restaurant which serve delicious sushi, but too bad they only have limited beer selection and doesn't have any liquor yet."
"Top untuk semuanya, hanya mungkin bisa ditambah fasilitas spa and massage"
even superior room only 15m2 but the lay out quiet efficient only dont have open window.
Free parking and clear
This hotel is underrated. All aspects of service from this hotel are excellent.
"Bersih, nyaman, strategis"
So far so good.. Sangat berkesan
"Newly open hotel. Located in main road to nusa dua. Clean, and very cheap. Great lobby"
The best & recommended 🙏👍
Clean room and very helpful staff. The only draw back is the lack of vegetarian options on the food menu at the restaurant. But not complaining as the chef was flexible and managed to make something nice for me.
Good services and clean
Great value for money . Staff and food amazing. Only downside room was a little small but I paid for the bargain room
"Staff was amazing, rooms are great for this price range, and the rooftop restaraunt was really good."
Highly recommend!!
"The gym is nice. 2 treadmills and awesome weight machine. The staff is amazing, caring, helpful. The restaurant is pretty good. However, it got no AC so it's tough to eat there."
Very recomended !❤️
The location  very strategies to the convenient place
"I'm a travel agent having reviewed  over 50 hotels around Asia in the last 12 months this place out of all of them which range from 3 to 5 stars have the best service and staff by far. Only issue I had was there was no fridge in the standard rooms.
The place is immaculate and the service perfect. The staff are so friendly.
Highly recommend.
35k in a taxi to the beach clubs and not far to kuta or legian but I wouldn't bother with that area its awful.
Food at the hotel is good is good also."
Clean rooms. Great friendly staff. Location was central to day tours we wanted to do. Abit noisy at night time being on a main road but didn't bother us too much.
"I don’t think this hotel is classified as 4 star hotel, because there is no even a minibar in the room. I was looking for a fridge to put my drinks. Bur overall, thumbs up for the outstanding services. It is value for money and the room is very clean."
"Clean, cheap, near nusa dua, but less soundproof"
"Location ok on by pass, so no traffic."
"After a long hours of roadtrip from Jakarta, I find the hotel is satisfying. Although it's small size room but everything is new and clean. The toilet capsul made it unique, hot water is running well, the towel is new too.
For me, refrigerator is more important than a safety box.  Appreciate if you can replace it. 
Breakfast is good with same menu for 2days, with sea view. 
Love the interior design lobby. 
Lack of car parking, but the staff can manage it, they provide the parking lot at the neighbor.
Overall love this hotel."
Immaculate with great staff. Food also good.
"Yes its true, Americans that travel to other parts of the world just expect the treatment received in NYC at the finest establishments and this hotel delivers! Very acute attention to detail by the staff anticipating my needs and guiding me around the property personally. If you have a request, ask the front desk and they will try their best to deliver. Where the property falls short is the Gym and the Pool. For an in-depth look at the property watch my upcoming full review on my YT channel BryceAllwin"
Well maintained property value for money
"Everything is ok, just that room is small."
"Weird pod bathroom, tiny rooms, comfortable bed. Noisy, right on main road. Try to vet a bay side room. Meant to have got a last minideal from agoda, but if you look at hotel website, its virtually same price. Not under or over priced. Staff are nice."
The room is well designed and attractive.
"This is a nice hotel with awesome view at the restaurant. However, the rooms are small and the location is a little bit far from the main attractions in Bali. I don't feel Bali's vibe during my stay there due to its location. The are a couple of walking-distance convenient stores and some food hawkers/stalls serving delicacies though, if you down for some traditional street food."
nicely priced hotel with good employees and nice service
"Room is as pictured. Beautiful white marble all around with exactly that view of the bay. Seemed to be a very new suite. We found that there wasn't very good ventilation, so we had to request an air filter from the staff, which they provided for free. Food was good but limited in variety."
"I stayed at 2 levels town house. A loud music disturbing before 6 am. Located on the main road, not as expected near the beach or on calm & natural atmosphere."
"If you're looking for a small room, with a silly capsule as bathroom, no closet for your clothes, a tiny little sink with a not good working watertab and no fridge this is your chance. Realize the hotel is very noisy. Airco is fine. For this price there are many better choices."
"This hotel is the 5th hotel during my 6 days stay in Bali. We're check in 24 nov around 5 pm, got off the hotel, with 2 suitcases & 1 laptop backpack no one offered to help. There are 2 receptionists on duty were very unfriendly, the check-in process took a long time, but there were new guests who arrived & immediately ordered rooms (without OTA) They served immediately. the only advantage of this hotel is that the furniture is still new, yes, it's a new or recently renovated building. if you need just to sleep, this is the right hotel. Because there's nothing else to enjoy, the pool outside is in the housing complex behind the hotel, parking is also separated outdoor, hitching a ride in front of the Mahogany hotel, breakfast needs improvement, compared to prices, it's really expensive, of course because the previous night we stayed at another hotel not far from location with infinity pool and much better facilities are much cheaper"
"I don’t recommend this hotel at all.  Our room stank. There was moldy air condition. After one night we started couching. We asked for another room. They gave us room on the same floor that was similar. It wasn’t a pleasure to stay in this room at all. We asked for cancellation of our stay that they rejected.
Room is very small. Make sure that you check how toilet looks. It’s small cabin where is shower and toilet located.
Swimming pool isn’t in hotel building. You have to leave hotel and go through another buildings.
At the end I had to spend in 20 minutes in lobby for room double checking..
Worst hotel I’ve ever been.  1 star OYO hotel that I booked to storage my luggage was better…"
room is clean but receptionist is not helpful check out time is more than 25 minute is too long
"Small room with  wc literally in the middle of the room  no transparent window.  
While checking out,  staff found tiny blood spot on the bed and charged 20k rupiah.  So they preferred get such a""big amount "" of money and loose client.  Zero loyalty,  zero intelligence."
Rooms smell and it is catfish
"The staff went above and beyond. An amazing stay, I would recommend and book again!"
"New, comfort & Affordable"
"Outside traffic is a little loud but the Hotel is superb and Excellent value for money , probably the best Hotel I have stayed in .. 🌸🌼🌺"
"The rooms were slightly small and not the best value for money. the pool was also not very desirable. 
Very clean, near to airport and kind staff."
"Although room feels a little bit old,but they keep the room clean,staff is helpful and they got decent facilities.
Worth the money."
Very good location and Breakfast is excellent Very excellent staff
"We got this hotel as it was near the airport, and near our water sports spot! Location is good for that though we didnt have time to explore other things around. Hotel room is small, but not too claustrophobic. The bathroom is a cube so is very cute. We didn't swim but there is a pool. Breakfast spread is not too many but not too bad either, although was a bit under staff that morning. Hotel is clean and staff are friendly."
Hotel room is nice and clean. The staff is very friendly. A new hotel and below there is a Singapore breakfast place. Ah Kun loti and I think is most of the Singaporean love this brand 阿坤面包。
Clean
"This hotel was very compact, good if you just want somewhere to lay your head. Great value & newly renovated. 
The staff were amazing 🥰"
Would love to stay there when we go to Bali next time.
"If you're looking for a cheap budget hotel in nusa dua this is a great place. They have a nice roof deck and an OK jap resto upstairs. The rooms are basic but clean. W
Went here just to wait on an evening flight. First thing I notice when I got here is it smells really good and clean. Okay for solo trav. I didn't mind the airplane shower type it was clean."
"The hotel is very newly renovated and looks quite sharp.  However, the technical side of things in terms of ventilation, air conditioning capability and plumbing were extremely poor.  
Upon entering the room, it was quite muggy as the AC was not already turned on as some hotels do.  It took about 45 minutes for the room to cool down to the desired temp and dry out.  There was a distinct dampness in the air and the bed linens felt slightly damp at the start.  The AC unit was definitely underpowered and looked somewhat old, so I thought it might have been a salvaged unit from what the hotel was pre-reno. 
I decided to take a shower before heading out for dinner, and that just restarted the cycle of mugginess again as the shower fan was not at all strong enough to vent out the steam from the shower.  The all-in one toilet and shower unit has the fan built in at the top and it was noisy when started up, but with very little effect.  
Couple of other annoyances: 1) the sink was very slow to drain (~10 minutes to drain the amount of water used to brush your teeth); and 2) the light switch arrangements were idiotic, with so many switches for the various lights that you had to keep trying them all to memorize which did what, and then in the end one of them was not even a light switch but a button on the tv wall.
All in all, this place is all surface appeal and no substance.  Even the low bench beside the bed was stuffed with low density foam, so you’d sink in far too low to be comfortable.  Never coming back here again with so many other options in the same price range."
"Clean room, but traffic noise outside can get you if you need an early rest."
"This hotel is very clean, we love it. Swimming pool is far and it's located in another building. Roof top restaurant and downstairs coffee shop are great. Staff very friendly and helpful. Location not so bad but it's quiet. It is far from beach and party places. But you can take Grab taxi. Overall, was a great stay."
Clean and Price Very Ok
Accessible to stores and transport. Staff are very nice and clean room. The restaurant have nice overlooking view of the bridge.
recomeded hotel👍🥰
"Kudos to Taufik. Really helps us in guiding us to what we can do around the area. Hotel also allowed late check out which is awesome! All the staff always greeted us. You’re really feel welcome in this hotel. 
We booked 2-bedroom residence. The pool is next to the house. It’s great if book with group of friends. I will not recommend for families as I feel that it’s a hassle for you if you want to bring babies/kids up & down the hills to/from the lobby unless you have a rented car. Also the 2-bedroom residence is a double storey terrace house. The staircase is too steep/narrow/dangerous for young kids as they probably run up & down the staircase."
Unreal. Best hotel in Bali.
Unreal. Loved it
Big thanks to mbok at the breakfast time.
Value for money 5 star!!
Very quiet hotel.  Facilities were limited.  Staff limited but generally nice and clean.  The room we booked was very small so had to upgrade to a bigger room.
"We had a perfect stay at this hotel. The room was clean, staff were great, and the bed was very comfortable."
Overall the place was huge with privacy as well as a common areas for gathering. Facilities wise i would say will have  rooms for improvement or upgrading.  If not asking for very high standard of a villa experience this unit is good to book for short stay.
Hotel was clean staff brilliant food very good
Friendly helpful cheerful staff to great service restaurant brilliantv
"room smelt so damp due to no opening window or extractor fan. bad location as far from nusa dua beach, needed a grab. on-site food was great & the gym was small but not busy so very good. pool was far from hotel. close to airport. only stay for 1 night, not like the photos. nice staff"
Good view in the roof
"Great overall
Always stay in bali nusa dua"
Best hotel
ok
