"Very good place, good breakfast 
Minus: worm in the soup! Don't eat in the restaurant(except breakfast)"
all the best ..
I did really enjoy during my stay here...love the services from the staff
"Such a good location to stay in Bali, because the area is strategic and easy to reach from the airport. 
The rooms are good so far but still need to boost the cleanliness.
Thank you for the service excellent and we will be back soon!"
"Friendly staff from the entrance, lobby to the cleaning services.  The breakfast is complete meal and you just eat brunch so no need to worry for your lunch (money wise :)"
"Here only for the night as close to airport and many handgift shops along the streets. Paid 330k for superior room included great breakfast for 3 stars hotel. Comfy bed, clean & decent room, has seating & refridge in the room, long swimming pool, mini gym.
Tips:
-Stay in this hotel if u like an area where is not too touristic, many cheap local restaurants nearby and some open 24hrs. There is a shopping mall only 5min walking (Park 23 Mall).
-Beach is only within 10min by ride sharing taxi/motortaxi, just download apps : grab and gojek. Or u can hire motorcycle/car."
"Clean hotel, friendly staff service. The environment around the hotel is supported by the presence of several favorite restaurants, there is also a mini market which is sufficient to meet the minimum daily needs. Easily accessible parking space, and the surrounding location is relatively free from traffic jams."
All Pro no cons
Lokasi strategis dekat bandara
Good Location
"Great room and facilities with reasonable price. Food was good. Location is very strategic, close to many places to eat and shopping."
"Good location for solo traveller, close to Kuta and nearby co-working space (Go-Work)."
"Best Budget Hotel in KUTA..clean, affordable and awesome"
"Breakfast quite a lot of variety, many food shop along the road. I had a nice stay. Keep it up!"
"Silahkan menginap disini, memuaskan"
Overall...Good
"If you have a long layover or just need to stay in Bali for a single night business trip, this hotel is okay. I don’t recommend it for a holiday stay because it’s far from the beach area."
The staff here were so accommodating!
"Overall good.
Thank you"
"Overall the hotel doesn't lost its quality even though the condition isn't better yet. Compared with other hotels, it is remaining in the same condition before the pandemic. 
Perhaps there are minor changes, but they've tried to manage the performance as 3-stars hotel with their own.
For advice, please put disinfectan/anti bacterial liquid in the elevator or in front of it."
"Pros:
Breakfast buffet is well worth the price though and staff are well-trained, polite, and helpful.
Cons:
We got a room at the 4th floor and couldn’t connect to their wifi at all. You have to work at the hotel lobby if you need to work. 
Cockroach in the room :("
"The hotel situated somewhere in between the airport and Kuta Beach, so it is not so crowded (like if you stay near Kuta beach) but still can reach many places within minutes."
Very cheap for hotel located in strategic area. If you look for hotel to stay for 1 night and not expecting facilities just for sleep
Not the best choice while local Indonesian holiday very busy and noisy specialy around the swimming pool  ...
"Pertama kali nginep disini. Staff ramah, kebersihan, fasilitas, so far good"
"kamar bersih , harum , dengan harga sgtu worth it"
Not far from the ngurah rai airport
Quite good deal with nice buffet brakfast.
"Staff was really helpful and nice, great location for whom want to explore the south of Bali"
Polyester pillow case and towels a little bit dirty.
"I booked a superior room for 1 day, but when i checked in, the receptionist said that my booking was for 12 hours transit room only. Very disappointed!!"
"The hotel is strategically located, but unfortunately the service is not professional."
"Great hotel with a great rooftop pool. Really hot in Bali. Breakfast was okay. Use only Blue Bird taxi or Grab. Watch out for currency scams, anyone giving you small denominations is a scam."
The location is great in which is very near to the airport..and no hassle to get there in such short time
Bad service from the front staff.
Even we book a  family room they gave us a room standard which smaller then we expected by the way we managed it …standard breakfast & Wi-Fi only work in lobby & not in room so we couldn’t browse anything from room & need to come to lobby …overall it’s okay but not so good experience
"charge extra for soiled bedding due to bali belly
breakfast bad
room service had to pay cash"
"I stayed at PrimeBiz Hotel Kuta recently for a business trip. I think that the hotel is the perfect business hotel as the design is simple and sophisticated. My stay at PrimeBiz Kuta was a very enjoyable one, the room is clean, staff are friendly, the price is value for money and the hotel have very good facilities (sky pool, meeting room and free high-speed internet). Another thing i loved about the hotel is the Kopi Bali restaurant in the lobby, their breakfast and food and drinks are amazing especially the Gulai Kambing, Sop Buntut and the Kopi Luwat (Civet Coffee). 
I really loved the hotel and would definitely come back here whenever I am in Bali for business or with family. I Highly recommend the hotel to anyone who is staying in the Kuta/Tuban are who are looking for a cheap and high quality hotel. !0/10"
"New hotel, just openned in June, i had a two nights stay, the size of the room is quite decent.  it is very clean. staffs are very friendly. The food in the hotel restaurant(KOPI BALI) was amazing. they had the best coffee in Bali, even better than starbucks. trying is believing.
Hotel location is perfect, 5 min to airport, they have shuttle service to the airport. Near Kuta beach, local restaurants, night life. overall, I had a pleasant stay in Primebiz Kuta"
"I got a great deal when this Hotel still having an opening Price.
The Hotel is really nice and comfy, since it's a brand new Hotel.
Breakfast is OK, comparable to other 3 stars Hotel.
I like the design, just simple and elegant.
Located in the restaurant and shopping street in Kuta.
Really near to the airport, around 5-10 minutes by motorcycle to Kuta Beach.
Staffs are always nice and helpful.
Awesome Job for Primebiz."
"Everything is very clean, the staff is very friendly and sooo helpful!!! The airport lost my suitcase and without the help of the help of the staff I would be still waiting for my suitcase! The pool is also very nice and clean and you have a nice view over Kuta.
Kuta isn't the best city to stay but the hotel is doing there very best to make it as nice as possible! :))
We had a very nice time in the Primebiz Kuta Hotel! Thank you :)"
"Love our Stay at PrimeBiz Hotel it Was enjoyable.This Hotel is clean room, Good Breakfast, there's Kopi Bali House restaurant, biZness center, Free WIFI with good connection,Gym, Sky Pool, I will recommend  this Hotel to My Friends who will come to Bali. for my next trip I will come back to this Hotel."
"This new hotel is a 10min ride from the airport - great rooms and magnificent swimming pool on the roof. We truly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and had opted for this new one because of the many positive reviews and not to be stuck in traffic in Kuta when having an international flight to catch. This hotel is worth a 5 star (building, facilities, etc.)// absolutely money for value - strongly recommended!!!!"
"Our stay at Primebiz was a pleasant one. The staff were very helpful and always meet and greeted us on entering or exiting the building. The room was big with TV and plenty of channels and the bathroom nice also. Very modern rooms with big bed's and room for all your luggage. The wifi is good but it did not work in our room we had to use it in the lobby. There is a nice pool with a small gym on the same floor but there is literally only two pieces of cardio equipment in there. The breakfast buffet was nice too and changed slightly from day to day, however, on the day before last I chewed on what seemed like a piece of gravel in the food! This made what was a great stay a bit less greater than I previously though of the place. Other than this It was really nice, it's just a shame that the hygiene of the coffee shop that provides the food was not up to standard."
"We wanted an hotel for one night close to the airport. This one fit perfectly. 10min from the airport. Free shuttle to go. Staff was nice although we didn’t interact much. 
The room was very decent for the price. 
A perfect hotel if you need to make a quick stop in Bali like we did"
"This is a fantastic hotel and I wished I could have stayed longer. Overall the staff were excellent although there were some problems with English language skills sometimes. It's very centrally located and close to the airport. You can reach Kuta, Legian, Jimbaren and many areas as the hotel is in the middle of them all. The breakfast was great but almost all meat dishes which kind of sucks if you're vegetarian. One drawback is it wasn't quiet. They hold conferences there and the noise is very bad. During the night it is fine though."
"It's quite easy to find the location. There is no sign for the front office so everybody had to ask where it is. Need to put some money for deposit (will be given back if you don't use additional facility or don't break/take any things from the room). Overall the room is comfortable eventhough the room is quite small. If you need a tour around bali/rent a car even a motorcycle, you can talk to the front office any time. There are some cars available to be rent in front of the hotel, but make sure you make a bid to the driver because the price can be lowered around Rp 50k to 75k. Don't forget to collect some other tour brochures first for comparison."
"The hotel is close to airport and located in Raya Kuta rd. where lots of local restaurants available. value for money with nice and spacious rooms, wide variety of breakfast that changes everyday. the hotel is relatively new so need some improvements like gym facilities (only two when we arrived)."
"During my stay at primebiz Kuta Hotel was nice, the staff was very polite and helpful. They have coffee shop inside this hotel, which is great! Location is good to go anywhere, centrally located!"
As we passing by this hotel we saw big sign of promo price hotel.. so we turning back our car (good ads location dude..)..the room very clean (new hotel of course).. front ofrice staff really nice.. breakfast not to many variety but the quality is good.. especially the coffe hehhee... if the hotel can keep this price as their regular price...i think this hotel will be the other best choices for budget hotel..
"Primebiz worked out well. Around 10 minutes each way to the airport, and the hotel organised a car ($5). This road is becoming quite busy, and rooms at the front of the hotel (low numbers) and on the outer-face (even numbers) get significant traffic noise for much of the day and night. 
The footpaths were being rebuilt during my two stays, and a walk in either direction was hazardous. Contrary to some of the marketing, there are few nearby shopping and eating locations. There are always taxis on hand, but that was not my point in booking a hotel for location. 
Very friendly staff, still geeting the hang of their hotel, but always eager to please. Nice, airy, comfortable lobby. Roof-pool is clean and just big enough to stretch out, but there is no shade. Breakfast is very average."
This hotel is close to the airport. Ask the staff anything and they will help. It took about 20 minutes to stroll in the evening to Kuta near the Discovery Mall.
"really money worthy, we stayed 3 nights, hotel staffs are very helping, 10 mins walk to kuta beach, perfect stay.."
"it was great time there, loacted in tuba, not reallt crowded as legian and kuta, brand new hotel clean room , very helpful staff,,, and value for money.. one of my best experience... gladly comeback there if going to bali again..."
"I choose this hotel because close to the airport, my room was upgraded to a deluxe room with no extra cost, the room is good nice and clean, but the air conditioner in my room was not working well, it’s very slow to be cold, even though Bali is very hot in the afternoon.  I got a room near the street, at night the sound of motorbikes and cars was clearly heard into the room, maybe it could be considered for rooms near the street made more air tight"
Nice stay to start the holidays in bali and not far from kuta.
"Great stay. Please see my first review. We booked a couple extra nights here. As far as Kuta goes, this is a nice, inexpensive place."
"This hotel is only about 5 min away from the airport, but is rather inaccessible from main tourist areas, and it did not help that most drivers are not aware of it. The hotel provides transport to Kuta, however, it could be better if they could also provide a return transfer back from Kuta. Being close to the airport also means that your sleep will be disrupted by the sound of airplanes as room is not sound-proof.
Service staff was prompt with check-in/out and answering to our queries. However I was disappointed that they could not provide basic concierge services such as making a call to contact our driver.
Food in Kopi Bali was the saving grace of our stay. Love it that they serve Bubur Ayam for breakfast. And we had a Nasi Goreng and Soto Ayam which was good too.
I will not recommend this hotel mainly because of its terrible location."
We had a great time at Primebiz Hotel Kuta 👍🏻
Wanted to get more promotion
Good
"Nice hotel,helpfull staff"
"This hotel was good value for money. I was staying with another friend and both single beds were organised to a high standard. Room could've been a little bigger but sufficed. The only pointer I have is that the walls are thin so you'll be able to hear conversations coming from the outside. Apart from that, it is of good value and extremely clean. Staff are extremely friendly and location is within walking distance of many restaraunts and other local attractions."
"Near airport, clean, have designated parking for motorbike, swimming pool was good so far. Value for money from the price."
Tried the suite room and it was great!
"The room is spacious and clean. The location is good, nearby Airport and Kuta.  Staff are friendly."
"Lengkap, bersih, ramah... Dekat dengan Pia Bintang (fav pia recommended dijamin enak ), Joger, dll."
c u again
"Good place, just 5 minutes to the airport. 3 minutes to Krisna oleh2 Bali. Good staff 🙏👍👍"
Hire driver and hotel tour desk are very helpful you can save lots of money

"We got this due to its proximity to the airport. I like the fact that it offers a universal socket so I can still do my work while on a vacation. I just advise to make the pool more appealing by perhaps offering some massage at the pool side and a mini bar perhaps. All in all though, it was a good stay."
"This is my second time staying in this hotel. Its near the airport. Its less traffic than staying in Jalan Kartika Plaza. 
Its clean and friendly staff. 
I will surely stay here again on my next  visit to Bali."
Primebiz is our first choice when we travel to Bali. We are delighted to check in enjoy the facilities especially the rooftop pool and breakfast at the dining room.
"have spot on the linen, and not much food option surrounding"
"Nice room, friendly staff, food taste is good"
Deket sama bandara dan pusat belanja. Over all good
"Hotel quite good but for late check in @ nite no welcome drink, room lift broken so had to use loading lift and stairways. Hotel staff could have been more friendly. Menu n taste bfast not bad."
