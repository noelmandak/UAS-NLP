"I was in Bali for meetings in Denpasar so the location was perfect for me. The hotel is very comfortable, if a bit run down, and I like the feel of it. Standard breakfast for a hotel of this class.
I had a good room service meal. 
My only complaint would be that on one night there was repair/renovation work being undertaken at  the poolside at 1.30 in the morning. Noisy! I complained to the workmen and to the hotel staff but it still took a while to stop.
I would definitley stay at this hotel again"
"Overall, we had a great stay at this hotel and thought it good value for money.  The staff were really friendly, it’s well located by the beach and not that far to walk to the town.  The property is looking a little jaded but I would not let that put me off staying as the rooms and general areas were comfortable and clean, service was really good and I felt that the price was reflective of what we got.  I would definitely recommend a stay here."
"Great place to stay, lovely room with huge bed and very clean. Breakfast was enormous you could never walk away hungry. 2 pools to choose from and plenty of sunchairs right on the beach. Staff are really lovely."
"Nice place to stay in Sanur, Bali.  We had a great time during our stay."
"Great location on beach with very good swimmingon the high tide . Very close to many cafes and restaurants.
Enjoy the beach walkway which is 5 km."
"a quiet place but so many we can do. swimming in a calm pool, sunbathing at the private beach, cycling, jogging, playing tennis, or relaxing at spa. so peaceful, natural, and comfortable"
Will be back
Great stay would definitely  book again
Staff very friendly. All very good. Would return to this venue.
"Good location, beachfront view.  All rooms have nice garden view. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The choice of breakfast is still limited  due to limited occupancy hotel. but its still  quite good ."
"The hotel old and breakfast terrible, very poor, cabbage, eggs, few fruits, cheapest bread. No gym. Broken roads in garden with construction and mess. Beach dirty, but it’Bali. But stuff very kind and clean rooms, free water! That’s cool.
 My advice to hotel, at least make good breakfast and do some renovation, buy new something or paint it.
Overall hotel rooms good, but outside everything very old and boring."
"The location is great right on Sanur beach and the resort grounds are lush and beautiful and well maintained. Unfortunately the same can't be said about the rooms, which are old and run down, and also not very clean. Mould growing around the wash basin and dirty light switches... fortunately I had some wet wipes with me. But staff very friendly and helpful... once the rooms are renovated it will a great place to stay."
PRos: Loaction next to beach
Extended for 1 night
"Overall its great. The hotel has a private beach, which is the start of the 5 KM beach walk along the sanur beach. Its not just your typical hotel, but its a resort with villas and a beach house, where most guest spend their time on the pool or have breakfast. Sadly, the resort is a bit of a run down. Its rather old, and lacking maintenance in almost everywhere. Perhaps we were visiting Bali just after the Australia border had just opened and Bali tourism was just beginning to restart.  The resort was almost empty. Regardless we love the resort and will definitely stay again given the chance in the future."
"Covid restrictions for travelling and tourism are still very much affecting occupancy of hotels in Bali.
The advantage is that you can enjoy hotels nearly for yourself and for a cheaper price, but in my expirience in this case, still expensive in this case for what you get.
Personal attention is not at its best at the moment, with unclarity and contradictions in some things, like for example saying first breakfast was included and the following morning saying it was not.
For the price i paid, and with plenty of hotels in Sanur beach, i would try somewhere else next time."
This is not a 4 star hotel in my opinion. The rooms are sadly in need of renovation. The shower unit was old and needed replaced long ago. Beds were comfortable. Garden reasonably well kept and pool area fine. Price high for the standard of room. Pity as I have stayed in many Mercure hotels that have been excellent.
"The Mercure Sanur hotel is a good hotel and most beautiful area in Sanur. we always stay there because all is in Mercure Sanur hotel is great. We like almost in there and we always stay there if we travelling in Bali..I have good and nice memory in the Mercure Sanur hotel special for my birthday at July, 29 last year..The manager hotel give us the room nearly pool side and kids club and nearly beach..so I think is a beautiful moment at my birthday..in the afternoon we can ride bicycle for the hotel area..and looking for sunset. all in The Mercure Sanur hotel is good..beautiful moment..Thank you Agoda for choose the Mercure Sanur hotel for value the money and good location."
Our stay was fantastic - this was our second stay at Mercure Sanur.  We were upgraded unexpectedly to a very spacious beach front suite.  It was lovely as we had an upstairs and downstairs.  The hotel provided a baby travel cot for our youngest child.  The Mercure is at the end of the beach walk and so it is nice and quiet for families.  The grounds are stunning with so many different types of flowers and trees.  We ate breakfast once at the hotel and another time just out the front at the Gardenia Cafe - one of our favorites.  The Mercure is right on the beach... a fantastic choice for families with young children visiting Bali.
"The mercure sanur was everything I wanted & needed for my recovery trip to Bali. The location at furthest south location of sanur was perfect. I love the path along all the hotels and beach to sanur with many cheap eateries to choose from along way. Yoga hut on property and lovely pool with plenty of deck chairs.

After the week at sanur mercure I had planned seminyak for a week but lasted only 2 days before returning to sanur."
"This is not a hotel but a clean and beautifully designed resort with nicely done landscaped gardens, 3 pools and a private beach. We were 2 families and our rooms on the second level of a bungalow were spacious, clean and well maintained. Free Wi-Fi with strong signal (in our rooms at least). Excellent customer service, very friendly and very helpful staff. We really enjoyed our stay in the Mercure Resort Sanur and will recommend it to our friends."
"We were pleasantly surprised during our most recent stay at Mercure Sanur.  We have stayed here previously in April 2008.  This visit was much more pleasant.  The staff was much more friendly.  Everyone greeted us with a smile and a kind word. The food was better this time as well.  The room was clean and spacious.  The Mercure is in a great location and we enjoyed a walk along the beach path that's right in front of the hotel.  The hotel spa was fully booked, but the concierge made arrangements for us to go to another spa for a massage.  So glad we gave the Mercure Sanur a second chance during this vacation."
"i had one night in bali and the mercure in sanur was a short 15 minute taxi ride from the airport to hotel. the rooms are lovely and spacious, great bathrooms and comfy beds. small balcony to sit and have a coffee in a lovely garden setting view. great swimming pools and excellent beach side location. walking distance to many shops and restaurants in sanur. check in and check out counters were a bit slow, but hotel staff were friendly and helpful."
"After walking along the beach a few years ago, we discovered the Mercure Resort in a beautiful pocket in Sanur.  We have since made the Mercure our family must stay when going to Bali.  The rooms are great, the service is great, the pools big and clean, the location is beautiful.  Love this place!!!"
"5th time at the Mercure Sanur and still impresses with great friendly staff, fantastic location and great facilities. You really can't go wrong with the value offered by this hotel with generally great deals on DLX rooms which are roomy and confortable and the hotel sits in a great location in Southern Sanur right on a very clean beach with lots of eating option very close by on both the beach and roads. All of the staff have always been super helpful and friendly and the food has always impressed. I'm sure I will be back again soon."
"This is my 5th or 6th stay at the Mercure and I still love the place, location is great, staff are always super friendly and helpful and the rooms and grounds are fantastic, especially when you consider the pricing compared to other hotels in Sanur. Breakfasts are very good although seem to have increased in price to the point of it seeming like a lot of people are going outside the hotel to eat. Pricing for drinks was also rather excessive to the degree that even during happy hour (half price) the drinks where still more than many other bars but at least reasonable. Will still go back but will be unlikely to use the bar or restaurant much."
"I have stayed at the Mercure many times.  I really like it there, the rooms are charming and comfortable and it is very reasonably priced.  location is wonderful.  only downside is the pool is always too warm due to the dark blue tiles, but this visit I was very disappointed as both pools were not clean also.   I will always choose this hotel however and hope they will fix the problem.  The staff, ambience, attractiveness of the whole hotel will always make it my choice in sanur.  Restaurants I highly recommend The Porch and Gardenia and there is a wonderful tailor about 100 metres up the road  THE RITZ.  Their work is excellent and so are the prices.  For leather bags I highly recommend Brendaz Leather, beautiful quality and very reasonable."
"Mercure Hotel is one of those hotel/resorts that have a great feel about them, it's like a tropical-themed resort combined with luxurious rooms and smiling staff. 

Our room was very spacious, included a TV, large bed, balcony looking onto the tropical garden outside, with the bigger pool close by, and a lovely bathroom.

I really have nothing bad to say about this hotel, highly recommended for any travellers coming through Sanur."
"I am a regular at Mercure Sanur because it is a very comfortable hotel in a great position with wonderful ambience.  the gardens are gorgeous.  staff are fantastic. Local shops & restaurants are great. Highly recommend Denik Natural - had my whole lounge recovered and Ritz Tailor has to be the best tailor in all of Bali!   The only problem with the Mercure is that the pools are extremely warm due to the dark blue tiles and no shade, but they are very clean."
"For our family of four (kids 10&4), Mercure Sanur provided enough activities for the week we were there. We were wishing we had stayed longer. It was a hard life deciding between beach and bike gear! :)
One of the beauties of Mercure is that we can use the bikes to ride along the boardwalk - safe for kids though a bit of manoeuvring is required due to stalls and warungs along the way, in search of views, food, and just pure enjoyment. Comparing Mercure to the other beach hotels all the way up to Pantai Sindhu, we found we preferred Mercure for its relaxed setting, lack of airs and traditional architecture.
The pools & beach were inviting and warm, with adequate chairs, towels, etc. The beach was clean.
The shuttle to Hardy's was also helpful.
There were sufficient warungs near Mercure to provide variety in terms of menu and budget. We loved Gardenia Café and ate there many times.WE didn’t end up eating at Mercure as we had read that the food was not value. We had a look at one of the buffet dinners displayed and agreed. 
There was also a variety of massage spas to choose from on Jln Mertasari.
The Kids’ Club was disappointing compared to Sanur Paradise Suites Resort as the kids at Mercure have to be supervised by the parents, which defeats the purpose. 
There were also activities posted on the bulletin board near the Nakula Pool which were otherwise not well advertised to guests but maybe I didn’t read up everything provided.
Mercure could be more generous with their complimentary water and the wireless was sometimes intermittent in different parts of the room. Some saucers in the room would make it more comfortable to have a quick snack for the kids. The sofa bed was not comfy.
The airport transfer quoted online was double the price of their own taxi counter, which was comparable to the market price in Sanur.
Considering the negatives, it may sound like we didn’t enjoy our stay but we did. Perhaps if we had paid the full price, it may have been different."
"Mercure Sanur resort is such a very good example for how is an Accord Hotel - for all the 6 days staying there, we were very happy with the staffs so friendly and professional . The service is perfect . I'd strongly recommende this hotel to my friends if they have chance to go there: for it's location , service , price and so on - it's worth for money and time to stay there"
"Both of a coupls friend of mine & i like this hotel very much. We spend 2 nights in Mercure.

In fact, i email the guest relation dept before my Bali Trip. Telling them that we will be going to Bali for Honeymoon. Hopefully they can arrange a room with higher floor & non smoking room is preferable. 

We are so surprising when we step in our room. there is a Baliness cake with words "" Happy Honeymoon"" on in & a heart shape rose on our bed sheet.So romantic. 

Mercure hotel got 2 nice pools & they did provide transportation to nearby shopping centre every 1 hour. It is vry convenience."
"Mercure Resort Sanur is a great hotel, we have stayed there before and this time took 2 other couples back with us.  They were all impressed with the hotel.  Like the position on the beach, close to great restaurants and shops and we all enjoyed a few more activities on this side of Bali."
"We stayed at Mercure Sanur for three days, we used the hotel as a base for exploring the area on foot. There is an hourly shuttle bus to the shopping area which drops off at Hardys department store which was a bonus. The Hotel staff were all very professional and helpful. The hotel grounds are well maintained with a lovely swimming pool area as well as lounges on the beach under the palm trees, great for relaxing. There are several good, very reasonably priced, restaurants right out the front of the hotel on the street side as well as nearby along the beach. The buffet breakfast provides an excellent selection of foods for a solid start to the day. You can walk for miles up the beach, there are plenty of restaurants and markets along the way."
"We have stayed at Sanur Mercure two years in a row. We spent five nights each and have been satisfied with our holidays here. The thing that made us choose this hotel was mainly because it offered private beach at an affordable price. Mercure sanur has everything we expexct for our family holiday, private beach, kids club, two swimming pools, big comfy bed plus sofa bed in deluxe room, 2 choices of shower heads in the bathroom, hot water and water boiler for yout tea and coffee. We also like the tropical surroundings and the beach was nice with a calm currents, which perfect for young kids to dip in and frolic. On our first visit we had a deluxe room with a big room size and a small balcony and on the second one we stayed in a not too big room size but with a bigger balcony. We liked both. 
Mercure location was a bit secluded, and if you stay here, you'd have a couple of good reaturants options to dine without walking diatance.
There were little minuses. On both of our stays, one of the lights in the room were out. Plus our bathroom was a bit smelly. The swimming pools were not the best ones I have swam in. I wish they had the steps where you could stand along the sides of the pools. however, the kids were always happy swimming in both of the swimming pools."
"We love the Mercure. Staff are attentive, welcoming and polite. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Tucked away from the busier parts of Sanur but with good access to all facilities. Excellent shaded beach area, two pools and close to good local restaurants, bars and shops.Our choice of destination when in Bali. Outstanding value for the standard of accommodation offered. I can't fault it."
"I travelled with a group of 5 girls - we all loved our stay at the Mercure.  Check-in was friendly and fast, porter service was good, rooms were very nice, pools and beach were amazing, and while expensive by Bali standards, the restaurant served some delicious food and drinks.  

Bike rentals are typically available, but were not available during our stay.  There were many bike rental places near the hotel though, so this was not a problem.  Laundry service was offered as well (but quite expensive - there are other areas nearby that will wash / dry your clothing by the kg rather than by the piece).  

The hotel grounds are well labelled so that you don't get lost, and have a temple and tennis courts as well.  The front desk staff arranged transport for us for anywhere we wanted to go, and were happy to make recommendations to us.  It was the most relaxing part of our Bali adventure by far.  

One tip for this hotel is to make sure you book online, as the rack rates offered at the front desk are between double and triple what you can book for on the internet."
"Quiet resort in a good location close enough to restaurants and shops! Located at the very end of sanur easy to hire a moped or bicycle to get around! Staff were friendly and it’s a nice resort, rooms a little dated but comfortable! Great selection for breakfast, beach is right at the door step! Water sports at the front of the resort on the beach! Massages out on the street $8 AUD 
 
 negative was people were smoking in the restaurant at breakfast 🤢 which was extremely inconsiderate! Really should be NO SMOKING! They also  need a more organised method for the egg station many people standing around confused an entry and exit method would fix this issue! 
Would stay here again"
"Very pleasant place to stay at this resort, preferably transportation from the front villa to the beach otherwise everything is enjoyable"
We stayed 3 nights and it was so relaxing. Beach was gorgeous and clean and staff were welcoming and friendly
"This is the 2nd time we stayed in Mercure Sanur. We like this hotel because it has private beach and with the budget the room is spacious and has much variety of breakfast. Sanur area is also not too busy or hectic, just good for our holiday every time we visit Bali."
"We travelled as a group with people of all ages: from a 2 year old to a 76 year old. This resort had everything we needed! It was clean and quiet, 2 pools, a playground, beach, spa and great ameneties. We didn't get the breakfast as we preferred to walk every morning along the beach to find a new spot to eat at.
We really enjoyed our stay and will certainly  be back."
"Nice hotel with beachfront, staff are helpfull.  Will comeback again"
"Nice hotel with beautiful beach view, staff are friendly and helpfull. Will come back again soon"
"Breakfast was great and good location, staff was amazing 😃😃"
Good location and peaceful atmosphere
"Rooms were really dated. But you get what you pay for. Otherwise, the best thing is that their beachfront had plenty of beach chairs for lazing. It's a slightly further walk to the main street in Sanur. Breakfast was average. Staff were service oriented."
"Best location! Clean , great price"
Great breakfast. Staff was fantastic. All good . Having CNN was a bobus
Memuaskan
Great hotel. Very clean. Quiet. Friendly staff. Safe and secure. 15 minute walk along the beach to the town area.
"Mainly old guests, small and old rooms"
any teeth brushes are not served.
"This hotel is very nice, clean and pleasant to be. I had a superior room on the second floor with view on a very pleasant garden. The hotel is quiet, clean and perfect to relax. Swimming pool was great, tons of restaurants around. The breakfast was very good with real croissant or Balinese food. The beach is very nice, no killer waves like Kuta. Sanur is way more pleasant than Kuta. Genius coffee on the property’s is very nice, try their Balinese duck ! It was super good. In one word if you need days off to relax go for this hotel."
The cleanliness of the rooms weren’t so great. Everything looks old and dated. Didn’t even have a lamp in our room. Breakfast spread was excellent though and the location is great too.
"The staff were wonderful 
Perfect location"
"This is a quiet resort with stunning gardens. It's an older style property with friendly staff, mostly European clientele. Great base at the Southern end of Sanur."
Located off the main area and right by the beach. There are 2 clean pools which are not too crowded although only 1 pool bar was open during my stay. Room is decent-sized and clean and there are some upgrading works going on e.g. my room's shower head was changed to a brand new (powerful) one halfway during the stay which was a nice surprise. Very friendly and helpful staff. The spa is professional and affordable - so good that I went there every day. I also appreciate that they have a lounge area and shower facilities for use in case you have checked out but have a late flight. Overall a nice place to stay at when in Sanur.
"I had problems with my room as the shower mixer tap handle was broken so I went to the reception and got a free room upgrade. The upgraded room was fantastic, spacious, right by the sea. Speaking of which, is too shallow to swim. So it's nice to stay there but keep in mind you'll be just looking at it but not swimming.
The place is quiet and the beds are comfy. The rooms have musty smell so be careful if you're allergic to mould. It's a tropical place so many places have it."
"The rooms were unclean and poorly maintained, as were the facilities"
Very tired and food ordinary and boring. Staff lovely.
"Tired and needs refurbishment. Breakfast  not up to standard and boring.
Staff lovely.
Rooms maybe 3 star for facilities but 1 star for condition."
"My friend and I really enjoyed our lovely stay at Mercure. The room, amenities, spa and staff were truly amazing. Just note that the sun beds along the beach are really popular. A guest had rudely moved our belongings from our sunbed and claimed that she was there earlier but went off for lunch. It would be worth for the hotel to advise guests on courtesy/rules of sun bed usage. So that guests will know to respect usage of the sun beds. Defn worth going back for another stay!"
"Stayed here once before, returned on that basis, staff were really pleasant and helpful, rooms are aging, no mini bar, no fresh milk, (only powdered) rooms were serviced daily, but towels look and feel as if they are being washed in grey cement water, hard and colorless. Pools are ok, breakfast is cheap, $15aud, but cold and fairly bland. There are much better situated and up,arket hotels along the beach now.  Wifi is next to useless, seriously, really really slow and drops out continually, better off walk to nearby cafe and using there’s. Also, pathways between accommodation, pools and reception etc very dark, poorly lit and needs to be improved."
"Loved the day spa, therapists were fantastic, the spa was very clean and the prices reasonable. The room was clean and spacious with a balcony. The hotel is in a great spot on the beach and you can eat at the organic cafe on the beach or in the hotel restaurant. If you walk out of the hotel on the otherside you will find the main street with lots of restaurants and shops. Will be back!"
"The good things on a wonderful beach and located near lots of good restaurants.
Poor - staff we’re inattentive and numbers much reduced in the restaurant at breakfast . Food quality not as good as on previous visits. Everything looking very tired in rooms and needing update. Need a quiet pool holiday ruined by screaming children every day for a week and unsupervised children and scrummages over sun beds.
Overall very disappointing- this used to be a very good hotel."
"Lovely rooms , good food, right on a good beach, near small shops and restaurants."
"Hotel all good I have stayed there on numerous occasions as a quick stop over.  Only issue I had this time was I incorrectly hit the wrong date when booking realizing my mistake I tried to change the booking (within 5 minutes) but this hotel had a non refundable policy.  I totally understand and appreciate the non refundable policy, but I think as it was such a short time, the hotel would not have lost any other potential bookings and they would not have started any of the booking processes. Agoda were very helpful and contacted the hotel but the hotel decision was not to refund, I could cancel but not get the money.   I contacted the hotel personally to explain my case but have never received any correspondece from them.  I was a return guest to the hotel (not that that should make any difference), but I will not be staying there again in the future.  So next time you make a booking double, triple check that you have hit the correct date (especially the month)   lesson learned"
"Superior rooms are better than deluxe! Ask for upstairs superior overlooking the pool, you wont be disappointed. Rooms a little dilapidated but atmosphere plus and very comfy! Gardens gorgeous. Staff amazing. Great location. Wouldnt stay anywhere else. Highy recommend RITZ tailor just up the road, has made hundreds of dresses for my business, not a stich wrong! Very reasonable prices. Gardenia is great for coffee/meals. DEnick Natural has recovered my lounge cushion x 2 over last few years also highly recommend.   The only negative is the dark blue tiles make the pools too warm"
"Terrific place to do as much swimming and  partying  as you want or as much relaxing (R & R) as you want.
3rd time there and many more to do when we can."
"We have been going to Bali for 20 years. We travel there every 6 months and have stayed in many hotels, resorts, and private villas over that time. we decided to stay at the Mercure Sunar because the pictures on the internet are very enticing and make the place very inviting. However, that was not the case. On arrival we were put in a room bottom floor of 3 levels. the room was dark, cold and damp. You would pay $30 for anywhere in Bali for this room. I requested another room, only to be told i would need to pay another $120 per night on top of the $110per night we had already paid. I refused. I requested to be transferred to the Mercure in Legian then. Amazing they found another room, near the pool 2nd floor of two levels with a balcony. Much cleaner and brighter and in a little better condition.
The building was very old and needs lots of repair. It is very overpriced and run down. It is quite a long way from the main attractions of Bali. I will not stay or recommend it to anyone."
"2nd stay at Mercure Sanur. Like the southern location and beach area. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Nice grounds, choice of pools and large beach lounging area.  Plenty of restaurants, spas and shops nearby."
Perfect position...we keep going back
This hotel lives up to its website and advertising. It is located in a quiet area of snow and right on the beach. The poos are nice the atmosphere is cosy and relaxed everywhere. If you want pantries on the beach you have it when you book in this hotel.
"Bali isn't as cheap as it was but this hotel is still great value if you're not wanting 4.5-5 star accommodation.  I stayed at the Novotel in Benoa for not much more.
Room size (7), Cleanliness 5, staff 7, Breakfast 7, Location 9."
"We had an amazing time, such a lovely place and everything was perfect! Thank you!"
"Nice hotel, great price, but too much insects in room"
"There is nothing to remember after visiting Mercure resort.  Very worn out, needs renovation, for facilities and for rooms.  Many people book this hotel because it is right on the beach and close to the airport, but there are many other smaller hotels with clean and nice facilities at half price of Mercure. The two spots to visit if you are at Mercure are Yoga @ Power of Oasis and Genius Cafe - these two outlets are not under Mercure management - they are located on its territory. Have fun!"
"The entire resort needs to be updated, it's looking tired and in need of many repairs. 
Upon my return to Australia I told most of my friends that I was very disappointed with the resort as it's quite expensive and old and I don't think I would return. 
The menu hasn't changed in all the time we have been coming and great food makes a difference. Most nights the restaurant is empty, it's ashamed because the staff are outstanding."
"Hotel staff are friendly, hotel is in good location on the beach with decent dining options close by, food and beverage pricing is quite high so we didn't use the hotel bar or restaurant at all. Rooms are fine but very variable with some DLX rooms being very roomy and reasonably new while others were a lot smaller but refurbed and some didn't seem to have had much done to them at all so were rather old small and tired and not even close to the same standard as the better DLX rooms(we were part of a group with all of these rooms represented). Pools were fine although the larger one tended to get very hot. Beds were fine but the supplied pillows where very fat so I had to use a decorative pillow or wake up with a sore neck."
"This was the second time we stayed at The Mecure.  Thoroughly loved it.  Our room was DEVINE (we scored an upgrade to a sea view room)
Every single staff member we came across was so friendly.  Pool was lovely, beach was perfect.
We are definitely staying here again.
See you in October Mecure 😃"
"It was my second time staying at the Mercure Sanur.  I loved the location which is  a beachfront and the Balinese style of the hotel. Nevertheless the room needs a little attention as it looked needing an upgrade.  My bathroom sink tap was loose and hard to open. 
Upon arrival my room wasn't ready but when I gave my feedback about it, the check-in staff offered me a late check-out without a cost. I was happy at that.  Otherwise a lovely place."
Great pool and gardens for a large hotel it has managed to still have a Bali theme.
"This is a large hotel resort, but has amazing gardens and still has a Bali fee to it.  Towards the southern end of Sanur so a little bit out - they have a shuttle into centre, but there are still loads of shops & restuarants near by.  Great to walk along the beach"
"An old hotel with probably minimal budget renovation work. In a renovated room , some fixture in the unit kept failing even after being fixed. The towel hanger kept falling off everytime we put towel on, twice the room black out coz of short circuit. The children play room shaggy.  The beach are great but the  water dirty with all the pollen and debris carried out by the current."
"Great location right by the beach. Hotel room spacious and clean, comfy bed. Pool not our thing but I guess just like any hotel pool. We opted for breakfast elsewhere, no problem to find somewhere and it's much cheaper and probably better than the hotel buffet. Price a bit high for what it is but if you are after location this is it! Friendly staff, lovely gardens. Would stay away from beach in much more modern hotel for half the price next time. Sanur is easy to get around and beach access is close from anywhere."
I love staying here so much more peaceful than Kuta.
"This is a great place if you get the right room. It's a big complex so if your room is near reception, it's a few minutes walk to the beach. We lucked out with a great room close to the beach and pool.Some of the staff at the bar seemed unhappy and were quite rude, but otherwise, a good place"
"The hotel's location by the beach is fantastic, close to shops, and restaurants. A shuttle service to the supermarket is provided several times daily. The room is spacious and clean and the hotel's natural surroundings makes it a truly relaxing place to be."
"Check in was a long,  slow  and painful process. Breakfast is extremely overpriced. Wifi was so so. When we were departing, we had called an Uber. Apparently uber is HATED and despised here. When our Uber van arrived, the taxi drivers sitting across the street came barging through the security gate from across the street and immediately began to physically push our driver around, took his car keys and tried to drag him out of the van...wow... all  the while hotel security was allowing the bullying to go on. They scared him so bad, he left in a hurry and we were left to find another method of transportation. Just don't use Uber to leave hotels in Sanur. It was a mob scene and a bit scary. Everyone has the right to make a living."
"This is the email I sent to hotel management
 Good evening David,
My name is Kevin Fitzgerald, my wife and I checked into your hotel on Saturday 27th May staying for 8 nights.
David we chose the Mercure hotel because of its standing in the industry.
Since we have checked in we have had nothing but disappointment which I will list below.
Before I do, I will give you some information about myself and my wife so you can understand where it's all coming from.
I have worked in hospitality for more than 30 years as a chef in the U.K., South Africa and Australia. I have been an executive chef in four and five star hotels and currently I am Operations Manager for 16 kitchens in Perth.
My wife Marlien is a classical trained chef in five star hotels in South Africa and is currently working on the sales side as a key account manager in the industry in Perth.
Also, we are both very well travelled and passionate about the hospitality industry.
•Checked in on Saturday at 11:30pm, could not get a drink or anything from room service at 12.15pm. All they offered was warm water.( this could be fixed if you stocked the mini bars in rooms as a norm in most four star hotels) •there were workers putting up tents for the Sunday market outside our room making a noise when I asked them to stop they were rude.
•The noise went on until 1.30am
•Telephone in our room not working so I had to walk to reception to complain about the noise.
•when choosing a room we also check the bathroom as my wife has a dislike for shower curtains, in your photos on line your rooms clearly show a glass screen. Can you imagine our surprise at a shower curtain.
• only one power point in the room was working under a counter, so we had to get on our hands and knees to plug a kettle in for a cup of tea.
•Bathroom had cobwebs in the shower, not very clean to a four star hotels standard.
• Toilet was smelling like a men's locker room! It was disgusting.
To you and your staffs credit you did change us to another room a"
"Pro: the beach is One of the best in sanur. It's modest and small.
Cons: rooms are noisy."
"Great spot on the quieter side of the island, everything well catered for."
"Security not friendly and helpful, but the rest of the staff ok. Rooms and Restaurants are average, but a bit pricey."
"Wonderful location. 
Some great places to eat along the beach and out the front of hotel. 
One big disappointment was the Indonesian buffet with traditional dancing. This was meant to be from 18.00  to  22.00 but by 21.00 the started winding down the food. We didn't get there till after 20.00 very disappointing. 
Not hassled on the beach by people trying to sell you things."
"Pros: private beach, quiet resort, huge bathroom
Cons: breakfast not really that good"
"Went on Hindu silent day paid for full day and got nothing, they didn't clean the room and had to pay for lunch and dinner (fixed price 2000,000 rupiah for a carvery which got you a teaspoon of roast chicken no other choices. 3 days out of 7 days we had to ask for clean towels in our unit as they weren't replaced.  The pool towels were gross, stained etc."

"the staff were very friendly and service was great however,  the rooms were antiquated, small, in need of maintenance and had a mouldy odor"
"have stayed at least a dozen times at the Mercure Sanur and every time I have a great stay.  Staff are always super friendly and efficient,  rooms are clean and everything works. The beach is great as is the breakfast.  prices are a bit dear at the bar but there are now a few cheap options just outside the property so you can mix it up a bit."
"I love staying at the Mercure Sanur (12th visit) - the staff, rooms, location, ambience, gardens are all wonderful BUT.......the pools you cannot swim in, it is like stepping into a very hot bath - very unpleasant!!  There is no shade and the dark blue tiles attract the full sun all day.  They need to recitify this problem urgently - it has been a problem for 10 years that I know of!!    Highly recommend Ritz Tailor nearby for perfect alterations and copy your old favourites at very reasonable price and Manik  Natural on the left on the way up town - did a perfect job recovering my lounge suite.  just took the loose cushion covers, plenty of fabric to choose from - fraction of the price charged here in Oz."
Have stayed at the Mercure quite a few times and always find the staff very obliging and friendly....easy access to beach and lovely beachside restaurants....the rooms are clean and have found staff very approachable should you have any problems....a nice place for a  relaxing time.
"Arriving into the vaulted reception area we were very impressed. Stunning gardens and waterfeatures everywhere.
Unfortunately from the time we were taken to our room until we left we were never again impressed .
We arrived late and exhausted were shown to our rooms (we had 2 to hold all of the family). The airconditioner  seemed to be pumping out mould spores and sounded like a freight train.
So bad it triggered a major asthma attack. I complained  during our first morning saying I needed a room without mould. They responded by sending someone to check the aircon , he did fix the noise but the mould persisted.
Otherwise, the rooms have not been maintained and need renovation especially the bathrooms.  The towels were threadbare, the pool lounges were collapsing, the pools were too  hot.
I felt a bit sorry for the reception staff, it was obvious they were the brunt of many complaints."
"We encountered terrible service on our first day, having to unload our own luggage from the taxi, wait nearly an hour for our room to be ready well after check-in time, finally get a room with no towels and phone 3 times to request towels, eventually getting them after threatening to speak to the manager. The hotel manager apologised by sending some fruit and a letter of apology, which was a good gesture. 
The hotel is rundown and in need of general maintenance work. The pools are nice (with very warm water!) but the pool area is full of ants with grass and weeds growing between the floor tiles. Breakfast was good, however. 
The room was fine. I was surprised to see the fridge and tea-making facilities in the bathroom! It was quite strange and perhaps a bit disgusting. 
The location is wonderful, right on a beach with good sea for swimming, and walking distance to many shops, restaurants and cheap warung."
"Overall I would say 6 out of 10.
The staffs were very friendly and willing to help my family and me above and beyond. They were outstanding.
The downside during our stay were:
Its nice that they have their own private beach but it was not really clean.
The most dissappointing was the room itself, the room looks really old and tired.
I dont know about the other rooms but the one that I stayed in,looks like it needs major renovation.
Its good if they want to keep the traditional design but they seriously need to consider doing a lot of repairs"
Minor point was that food selection not much during breakfast
The beautiful coral beach and the jungle garden setting were remarkable. The breakfast was excellent and very good value for the money. Will stay there again when we go to Bali.
Peaceful away from hussle and bussel. Very relaxing
"Only stayed one night as had booked onward travel to Gili air. Booked on agoda daily deal so very inexpensive (£35). Staff very helpful, grounds beautiful and room service quick and tasty."
No complaints - all good.
Nice bungalows in the gardens but this is a rather touristic hotel. Good value for what it offered.
Needs a bit of tlc but all in all love the hotel
seems old . bed is old . goold location . need renovate
The staff was very helpful when my wife had an injury on the property.
Great staff & very central location. A couple of house keeping issues needed closer attention.
"This is a big hotel, but you still feel like you are in Bali.  The gardens are beautiful swimming pools huge so you can get away from it all and everyone if you want.  I had a room right on the beach great to hear to waves during the night."
"I had stayed here a few years ago but the check staff were so unhelpful I decided never again.  But decide due to location (close to the oasis yoga) I would give it a go.  I am glad I did all staff were great.  Beautiful gardens, clean rooms and right on the beach."
"We love this place, beautiful grounds, good location"
Bathroom cleanliness left much to be desired. I never saw a mop being used or near the cleaning trolleys. We had to ask for clean towels on our 4th afternoon as the room had not been cleaned at 3.30 p.m. And the towels had not been changed previously. No ironing facilities in room. Not what I expected of a Mercure Hotel and Accor as I am an Accor member. And have stayed in their Hotels before which is why we chose this particular Hotel.
"Close to good eateries on the beach front and nearby streets. Beach front is large compared to more expensive beach resorts located nearby.
Accommodation is set in relaxing garden setting without feeling of being on top of your 'neighbours'.
Second pool located in the garden setting is perfect if the beach is too windy.
Only negatives, the bathroom tiles need a make over and the wifi is frustrating tending to drop out numerously.
Will stay again at Mercure when in Sanua IF the price at the time is  acceptable for us."
