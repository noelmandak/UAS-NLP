"Hotel is located at the center location close to best beach clubs, restaurants and markets in seminyak as well as Canggu. In fact you can walk to some of the best restaurants in seminyak. coming to Hotel facilities, it provides basic good sufficient breakfast options, a good swimming and a basic fitness center too. Rooms have very comfortable bed equivalent to the beds of any 5 star hotel. Decent and neat bathrooms with all amenities. Housekeeping did efficient job during the stay. The front desk and restaurant staff is very courteous and well trained nothing less than a 5 star hotel staff, in fact sometimes they exceeded my expectations. Over all at this price it is a very good Hotel and can be definitely considered. Thanks 🙏🏽"
"We stayed here for two nights. Hotel is in a good location, walking distance to plenty of bars, cafes, restaurants, shops, etc. Staff were very friendly. Rooms were clean and had free water, tea, coffee, etc. Pool was nice and refreshing. Would recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Seminyak. If you're a light sleeper and end up on a lower floor, you may want to bring earplugs as sometimes you can hear the music from the bar next door."
"They allowed me to check in earlier.  The lobby was open concept. Beautiful but hot. It's common in here I suppose. No air con at the lobby. The room is clean, amenities okay. To go through to the pool area you need to pass the restaurant first. Staffs are kind and helpful. ATM, coffe shop, restaurants and minimart are practically next door. You can see rice paddy area next door too from the window outside of our room. Traffic jams at Petitenget, Seminyak area are common sight in front of the hotel. The Petitenget beach is less than 10 minutes by car (if there's no traffic jam). It's a delightful stay overall"
"I personally love minimalist & modern interior design and Kamaniiya room has fulfilled what I have been looking for. 
Staffs were friendly & the gym was good (not that big but pretty ok for me who just used the treadmill). The room was clean, neat, and has bolsters! Omg. Haha. I'm a person who always sleep with bolster (I would use my pillow as bolster if I stay in a bolster-less hotel), so this is such a great point 👏🏻. 
Keep up the good work, Kamaniiya hotel 🧡"
"We’ve enjoyed our stay in this hotel. It’s centrally located in Seminyak, surrounded by restaurants and marts. Hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. The restaurant in the main lobby is pretty good (we ordered the chicken caesar salad and ox tail soup). Swimming pool is small but great! The hotel rooms are on the smaller side, but the layout is great and it’s clean. We will be back."
"This is my 2nd time stay at Kamaniiya, and this time I stay with my friend. Really fall in love with this hotel, great location, great staff.... Super duper recommended hotel if you want to stay in Bali"
"Fabulous place to stay as a single woman travelling felt very safe security out front at all times and main desk with staff to help you at all times of the night . 
Room cleaned every day and the beds are so comfortable rooms quiet and also the pool is fabulous. 
Will definitely go back to Kamaniiya for my next Bali trip as it is so central to everything in Seminyak ."
"Can’t fault this Hotel , really enjoyed our stay and will be staying again in April! Breakfast was lovely and swimming pool and gym was also really nice 10/10 from us!"
Room was clean and modern. Also very nice space in lobby when you can rest. Good breakfast with many choices. Helpful staff. Highly recommended.
"Very friendly staff, good room and facilities. Location is good if you want to explore surroundings by walking, or by motorcycle.. but if by car, the traffic is crowded."
"Really enjoyed our stay here. Good breakfast, comfy beds and super helpful staff! Booked a driver for a day to Ubud in the reception and he was the best."
"Walking distance to my favorite spa place, pison cafe, and many others. Definitely will come back to stay at kamaniiya, btw the Breakfast is wonderful 🫶🏻"
"Beds were comfy, room was clean, staff were friendly and helpful especially housekeeping. Hotel location is strategic with nearby mini mart, money changer, and eateries. Worth it for the price paid. Overall, it's a highly recommended hotel to stay in Seminyak area."
"Frenly and caring staff, i was collapsed due to gastric and the staff taking care of me very genuine. Beside the room also clean and location is strategic."
"Booked a room for 2, but there was an option for 3 people without extra charge. Didn't expect it but they actually prepared an extra bed for the third person without us requesting, really appreciated that. Cleanliness was top tier, room is well decorated and we felt very comfortable. The parking space is very limited, but the valet is very helpful. Highly recommended stay"
"Spent 4D3N here to explore Seminyak & Canggu area. Can say this budget hotel is very recommended, for 300K-ish/night you’ve got spacious room, clean & the bed was comfy. From here you can walking distance to some good restaurant like Rayjin, having spa at Bodyworks or chasing sunset at Petitenget beach."
Kamaniiya was really a wonderful hotel. We only stayed there for 1 night but really made use of all the facilities. Had a wonderful dinner with cocktails by the pool. Enjoyed the gym the next morning followed with a scrumptious buffet breakfast. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful.
"The hotel is set apart from the expensive beach resorts, and walking distance to a good variety of international restaurants and shopping areas.
Clean and a great staff !"

"Really recomended hotel for petitenget area with the afforable price. It is clean and nice design. Little bit problem with car park if you came on the high season. But overall, I really enjoyed my stay in Kamaniiya and will back to this hotel for the next vacation"

"Great staff, clean and nice rooms, awesome location - walking distance to lots of great cafes and restaurants. Great value for price! Would recommend"
"It was strategically located in the heart of seminyak. Lots of cafe, bars, and restaurant within walking distance. No need to worry about finding breakfast. There are many great cafe open at 7AM and offers breakfast menu, and there is one nice small coffee place just right across the hotel."
"Its is a nice place to stay, we were staying about 5 days and the room were very clean. Its only the aircond a little bit warm but overall was okey! Will definitely come again and stay here!"
"had a quick but great stay here.
strategic location if you want to stay in Seminyak. lots of nice cafe and restaurant within walking distance. easy access for transportation. wish the ceiling light above the bed could be brighter tho."
Absolutely will go back to this hotel and will recommend to my family and friends if they go to Bali. So much in love with this hotel 👏👍👍
"The hotel is really near to a lot of cafes and restaurants (walking distance) and it is really value for money. Only downside is it is at busy area so there is a lot of traffic jam if you drive, but then everything is so near, just go on foot"
"Great hotel, quite spacious room and good facilities. Location is the best, you can walk to seveeal restaurants, minimarket, bar, etc!"
"Amazing value for money, great location only a short walk from some of Bali’s best restaurants  and modern and clean rooms."
"Staying in Kamaniiya for 5 days and I feel happy with what they provide for the price that I paid, nothing to complain"
Get there quick to relax in this superb spot bright clean hotel  really enjoyed it
Loved every moment I would rate this 9.7/10 only because I wish the tv had more channels or even if was a smart tv but everything else was amazing
Hotel is not close to beach. Also I had problem with that romboid lamp near the bed its hanging in height of my head so many time I hit it. Probably they should move it bit higher.
"+ Good location, comfortable clean rooms,  helpful staff
- Breakfast is okay, noise from the street.
Would I stay again? Yes, very much so."
"Last minute book for one night. Got their junior suite and it was very spacious and clean. The bed and pillow are really comfy, they also have bolsters which is a plus for Indonesian. Great location, walking distance to cafes and restaurants, even beach club."
What a good hotel with an strategic location in bali
The room is unique and very clean. Mini fridge is cold.  A 2 km walk to the beach and such is a good exercise.
"Staffs were helpful, room and facilities are clean, located near pharmacy, minimart, and good restaurants. Will sure come back."
Cool place and you can reach a ton of good place for eat
"Loved the location more than anything else. Comfy bed, gym suitable and pool well temperatured"

"The room is exactly the one you see in the picture. Clean, simply stylish, amenities is nice. The bed & pillow is good! Great location..

Noticeable hotel with full color. Room also fullcolor.

Recommended hotel!!!!!!
The hotel ia nearby from seminyak eateries & hangouts.. easily walk to the sites. Room is clean and the bed is perfect for resting from a bali full day.
Great place to stay
Clean room! Very friendly front desk staff. No complaint. Centrally located to cafes/restaurants/bar. Formerly known as Ibis.
This hotel is automatically becoming my favorite hotel when I want to stay in Seminyak area!
definitely will come back
"This is my second time staying in this hotel.  Good location, good price, nice room (but I do see some minor repair and maintenance required here and there in the room now compared to my first stay last year). Oh the bed is so comfy I slept like a baby.  Many F&B, shops, supermarts in this area,  beach is not too far from the hotel.   Good choice to stay."
The hotel is clean and the bed is comfy. Located at a very strategic location. The only downside the lobby is very hot
always come back here
"Great friendly hotel, staff and food excellent"
"the hotel very comfy for short holiday. location in the middle of Petitenget, not so far from best placaes in Seminyak. the room quite clean, also teh toilet. budget hotel that have many facilities."
"The hotel is situated around many popular restaurants and cafes. The rooms are clean and modern, and the pool was a great bonus!"
"Great place to stay when you want to strolling around Seminyak-Canggu-Denpasar. Clean room, affordable price & they provided you 2 bolsters!"
"Strategic location, you can find many cafe, resto, and store by walking. The traffic is so crowded because it is a busy area"
"Located in Petitenget this hotel is in closed proximity to bustling cafes, spa places and only 20 minutes walk to Petitenget Beach. 
Hotel staff are friendly and the room is rather small but clean. Enjoyed my four nights stay at Kamaniiya."
Location is strategically located at the heart of Seminyak. Walking distance to many good food. Downside only poor wifi so watch out if you plan to work. We visited when hotel is renovated (corridor can be full of paint smell) but we don't have any issue with this. Room is great for the price we pay.
"Located near lots of resto and cafe! All good but when i order order with extra bed, it was not that spacious. there's not a lot of chairs in the room but everything else is good! 
The extra bed is almost the same with main bed. They provide bolster other than pillow. Love it!"
Overall okay..
the amazing staff with very good attitude
"strategies location, clean & affordable price.."
Clean well maintained
all was good.
"Booked this place as a budget option after cancelling a Gili T trip. What a great find! 
Stayed 3nights in Double Room for avg $40 AUD / night. Honestly you can’t get much better for that price 
Cons
-No hot water. No matter when I tried it was like warm. 
-Towels we’re grey and smelly and they didn’t provide hand towel or face washer. Just two basic towels and bath mat that was stained
-No room service 
-My room didn’t have a window that opened
Pros
-Good location, walking distance to upper end of Petitenget with mini mart and supermarket right next door
-Two large bottles of water provided each day
-super comfy bed and pillows
-Pools out the back we’re actually great
-Loved staff - special mention to Feby who helped me call Jetstar to change my flights AND would change my larger notes each day into small notes for tipping. 
She is just lovely. 
If you’re looking for a great clean budget hotel in Seminyak would recommend. Just get some new towels Kamaniiya"
Strategic location • Value for money • Clean hotel —
"Kamaniiya is a great little hotel in Petitenget.
Whilst the rooms are rather small they are tidy and it’s perfect for a one night stay.
It’s surrounded by lots of cafes and restaurants."
"Hotel is big, clean and the staffs were always there to help. This is one of the hotels that really sanitise your rooms properly. Sent our laundry for washing and it was folded nicely and delivered to our room even when we went out for the day. The daily room makeup is impeccable. The only negatives are that gym is tiny and the threadmill is broken, the pool is small too. The location isn’t at Seminyak central, but Petitenget central. Overall, worth it and may come back again :)"
"The room a little bit small, we stayed for 4 nights there. And the airport transfer wasn’t standby maybe because not many guests using it. You can hear the music sounds quite loud from the restaurant/cafe next to the hotel in the night"
"I stayed here for Bali Marathon last August 2022. The hotel was very nice, modern look, enough parking lot for motorcycle and surounding by a lot of restaurant and hang out place."
Really worth the value. Clean rooms and lots of reastaurants within walking radius
"I return to this hotel as I find the beds to be amazing! Location is central, staff incredible."
strategic place
Really enjoyed it
Close to restaurants and coffee shops.
"I usually stay here for a few nights when I first arrive in Bali. The Jetstar flight arrives late, and the hotel has a 24-hour reception. The bed is comfy, there's a TV, and it's all you need on your first night or two. For the price, it's unbeatable and close to some great places like W, Potatohead, Ling Lings, and Pison coffee."
Keep up the good works kamaniiya!
kasurnya enak
"I got a promotion price and stayed for 5 nights. I loved the pillow and the shower (poured out heavily). It was really worth what I've paid. Unfortunately, the gym was closed at that time (no idea what the reason was for the closed of the gym)."
Location so close to every hip places in Seminyak
"Clean room, comfy bed, unique interior design"
Kamaniiya is best hotel in petitenget area. Near many cafe&resto. Really Best location and value for money!!!
Staff were very attentive and responsive! Kudos!
"Service was great 
Rooms was clean
Location is perfect and in the middle of trendy area of Seminyak. Highly recommended"
"If you enjoy culinary, party, this hotel is the best place. The location is strategist; so many modern cafe, beach club arounds.  The bed is convenience for sleeping, spacious bathroom and friendly staff."
this hotel near with any restaurant & bar around seminyak & petitenget. It also has a great room with large space.
"room is nice but ants are everywhere!
Staffs are so helpful from the receptionist down to the security who always help me park the car.
Overall will stay again but pls they really need to put ant killers in the room! it's horrible"
"My only complaint is they have yellowish stains on some of  the pillow covers and towels. Otherwise, it would have been a perfect stay."
Near Pison Cafe & many restaurant in seminyak
"Pros: very comfortable bed and pillows. 
Cons: showers are average
Average stuff: breakfast was good but not great, lots of Chinese food, not many Western choices. If you are paying extra for breakfast, you’re better off buying it externally. 
Gym: small but what little equipment it has is in good condition. Enough to get you by until you go home to a real gym. 
Noise: i slept well even though the walls and doors are paper thin. I could hear every word ppl said in the hallway, through walls with neighbours and ppl above me. Luckily they were generally quiet. 
Pool: pretty good, but no pool bar and the tanning lounges have no cushions 
Overall, its fine but not the best. Ok for the price point."
"Very very value for money. Great location however, towels have a smell.. And some stains on bedsheets. But for the price, its reasonable i guess."
"We had a happy two nights staying in here. The location was perfect for us. We just have to walk around the vicinity to enjoy Seminyak. There are some cons though. Parking space was limited, aminities were too standard; nothing special, and kind of noisy along the hallway. However, with the rate we have at that time, we have no complain. One thing we need to point out, please let the engineer staff who went to our room to put his boot outside. We just don't feel comfortable with anyone walking inside the room with shoes."
wifi is really bad .that’s why can’t be five stars
Good options for young couple with budgets
Best price and location. Close to so many restaurants!
Great value for money! Amazing location with cafes and restaurants within walking distance
"Over all is good.
it's just that breakfast buffet has a little variety of food and it takes a long time to refill."
"I asked to storage my backpack for a few hours after done the checkout (it's was for free, awesome) and then when I get back to the hotel request for my stuff, the staff asked to wait for a while and I waited for 2 fuckin hours in front of the reception balcony... When I confronted them why is taking so much to return my backpack, something wrong? One of them just said - oh I totally forgot your backpack, Sorry.  And that's it,   this make me so angry that I couldn't say even a word i just left ."
"Good value for price 
Friendly staff"
It’s spotless and very comfy. The only problem i have is only the water is not hot enough for shower.
"Clean, tidy hotel with good location. Close to lotsa points of interest around Seminyak. Didn't take breakfast because there were a lot of breakfast joints around the hotel."
