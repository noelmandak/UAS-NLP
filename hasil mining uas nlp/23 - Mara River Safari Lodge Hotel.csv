"Loved our stay here! Booked for my partners birthday and from the moment we arrived we had the best time. Food at the lion cafe was amazing including breakfast where there was so much choice savoury and sweet. Also had an evening meal here on the night 4 courses with bottle of wine which was amazing and really good value. The staff decorated the room beautifully and also gave us complimentary cake. The safari itself was fantastic as well as the additional bits you can pay extra for . We fed the giraffes twice ! Room really nice , clean and spacious and so lovely to see the animals from the balcony. All the staff were amazing especially in the lion restaurant,  all knew us by name and chatted to us everytime we passed through. Loved it here and couldn't recommend enough !"
"So glad i brought my kids here. Fantastic hospitality, super super clean park (no smell of poop at all too), tasty and affordable food options at Tsavo restaurant which even allows you to dine with lions (cant get any cooler than that), tons of affordable or even free activities to do in one day if you start early, generous sharing on the safari journey including ample time to take photos as the safari bus moves along, love all the meaningful performances put up by the staff and cute animals, and now let’s talk about the room. Fabulous spacious and clean room that allows us to feel like we are cohabitating with the animals. There really is nothing to complain about this stay. Truly awesome experience that we will never forget."
"Wow my friend and i booked into  the Swala bungalow it was amazing we loved it and was blown away how stunning the room  attention to detail is above and beyond, from the comfortable beds, beautiful linen, the large windows looking out to all the animals. We had the best experience we will be back our next trip in August."
"We have been many times its absolutely amazing new experience every time 
Worth every penny

We had 5 rooms this time everyone absolutely loved it Life Changing Experience for us all 
Thank you for sharing your beautiful Bali Safari with us 5 Stars"
"Amazing experience staying at the resort. The highlights would be:
1. Waking up to see Giraffe, Zebra, Rhino from the room was an experience unlike any that I had experienced in the past. We stayed in Twiga room which was very good and comes with all amenities that you will expect from a 4 star property. There is also a basket of carrots placed in each room which you can feed to zebra, giraffe from your room.
2. Nothing can beat the feeling that you get while having breakfast/lunch/dinner with the lions at the Tsavo Lion restaurant.
3. The park is very well maintained and there are lot of shows that take place throughout the day. One time day Safari journey, Elephant show, Tiger show and Animal show are included with the stay. If you want to have more experiences like feeding the carnivores, night safari etc. that too is available at additional price. Really enjoyed the various animal encounters and the African fire dance at the hotel.
4. The staff is very courteous and helpful.
Highly recommend everyone to go and stay at this unique resort."
"One of the best experiences of our holiday. Unlike the zoos in Australia you were able to get up very close to the animals and had ample opportunities to hold and encounter the animal for no extra costs. 
The night safari was the best especially having the big cats climb up on the back of the cage we we travelling round in. See those giant paws and massive teeth as the ranger feed them raw chicken. If you were silly enough you could touch their paws through the cage openings. 
The accommodation was amazing, very safari like with the mosquito net over the bed and the animals wandering around outside 10meters from the window. 
The pool was great as was the water park and the African fire dance. Got to pat a zebra by the pool who just wandered up. The elephant ride to breakfast was the cause of great excitement for my 9 year old son. Lots of good educational shows. I would go back. A two day stay is ideal. Another wonderful opportunity to see the animals was in the restaurant separated only by a pane of glass, you could almost touch the lions. Admire in wonder at their massive paws and big teeth and listen to the male lions roar. I didn't feel the need to walk around ever exhibit, the animals more or less cam to you."
"Mara River Lodge in Bali Safari Park is exceptional 
Staff are all a credit to Management 
Rooms are comfortable 
We would highly recommend staying here even for 1 night and get the package with Elephant Tiger & Bird Shows with Safari ride to see all the animals Great value where right out your door is animals Zebra Giraffe Rinos all wandering around You can even hear the lions roar Dinner is an experience with the lions right outside windows and their cave where they sleep right next to the Bar 
Definitely book for an amazing time"
"We had a wonderful stay here. The  experience was one we definitely won’t forget. From check in to check out it was seamless. Our room was exactly as described and looks in photos. We have visited this zoo several times before this stay and would highly recommend everyone to do so. Room beautiful and clean, staff friendly and helpful and buffet breakfast was yummm. Nothing to fault at all 😁😁😁 will definitely be doing again on our next visit to Bali"
"Our stay at Mata River Safati Lodge was exceptional. The facilities are of a high standard. My kids played for hours in the water park. As a guest of the lodge you get access to the safari park everyday you're there as well as a safari ride. We also paid for an elephant ride, which was a highlight. There is also a night show which is part of their night safari add on but guests can watch this for free. The lions are next to the restaurant and quite active, so you get breakfast with the lions included also. The room was great with lots of cable channels and an exceptional view of the animals. There's also a beautiful infinity pool. You can order floating breakfast here and their spa looks nice. There's also a pool bar which I think is open now too."
"Great location, convenient access to the zoo. Over value staying, included zoo ticket as well as water park entry. My 6yo and 10 yo boys really enjoyed the water park. Staffs are very nice and friendly. Lion restaurant is really special. Luck, we had a window seat table and the lion was walking next to us while we had dinner. Lots of wonderful memories, we will definitely come back."
"Love love love this place! Everything about our stay was amazing. We stayed in the upstairs Twiga room and I can't rate it highly enough. Being able to feed the zebras from your balcony was so much fun and have rhinos, wildebeest and a giraffe right in front of you is amazing!! Listening to the lions roar at night from  your bed was pretty special. The bed was a dream to sleep in. The staff are so welcoming and accommodating. Dinner was great as was the fire dance afterwards  and the breakfast with the lions was fantastic. I can't wait to stay here again. Hands down my favourite place to stay"
"We did not know about the accommodation when we decided to visit the safari.
It was the best decision to stay here where you can feed zebras from your room and also the entrance to the zoo area is free.
Rooms are also nice and clean.."
We can’t visit africa. So we came to bali safari. The best ever. Especially the view! Cleanliness.. and the buffey bfast : delicious ❤️. Definitely will come again❤️
"The best part is definitely view to giraffes, who are walking right below the balcony. The safari trip (bus version) was also included in the room price and was a lot of fun"
"The resort was well kept and the view of the animals from the room was simply amazing and wonderful. Is like traveling to Africa and still enjoying my nasi padang. My boys loved the resort and the animals. Staff was extremely helpful, kind and polite. We will def return and stay longer xoxo"
"It’s wonderful to see these animals so well loved and cared for. The pillows OMG best I’ve ever had around the world. The bed was so comfortable and you look straight out to the Zebras, Giraffes and Elephants. The room was so clean and comfortable, the staff are amazing. The food I had  in the restaurant for dinner was great, and Best Pina Coladas.  I had a wonderful stay."
"I had such a great stay at Mara Safari Lodge, I booked a night here to celebrate my partners birthday and the hotel really went above and beyond to cater to his birthday celebration. Included in our stay was admission to the zoo and we got to experience the whole park. It was such a special stay and we will remember the experience forever!"
"We are an Australian couple who came for one night, which was perfect! We stayed in the twiga room and had a great view of the zebra and rhinos.  The pool and spa were amazing. Good food in the restaurant, very reasonably priced. The booking included admission to the park, we went on the complimentary bus tour which was great!"
"We stayed 10 years ago and again yesterday it awesome. Ive been to Africa to a safari park and Mara is just as good, its a must kids loved it too:-)"
My husband and I with two teenage kids stayed  3 nights in Mara River Safari Lodge… I read so many wonderful reviews about this place and was so sceptical whether it would be the same after the pandemic… we were not disappointed at all… the lodge and the safari was out of the world and we enjoyed every bit of our stay there… it was like being in Africa only that I have never been to Africa 🤭. Please pay tribute to this place… it’s really awesome and I can’t praise enough of the staffs there… so humble and very accommodating.  I usually won’t miss leaving any accommodation but was a bit teary when we left. As we open the balcony to our room we could see zebras elephants and rhinoceroses roaming around… so many attractions were included during our stay there… it was all worth!! Love it all! Thank you so much for these beautiful memories!
"Great place! We’ve seen animals routine, feeding and play. That’s was amazing! Stuff is very communicative! Definitely coming back one day"
Staff are very friendly. Great experience especially if you have children. Had no problem with our stay at all.
"I was traveling with my father who had an accident just prior to arriving at the hotel and was having difficulty walking.  The staff were very accommodating, helpful and went out of the way to make sure we still had a great holiday"
"Thanks for the experience, our kids really hace fun with awesome view of our room, including experience in safari."
"Loved room overlooking animals, lots animal shows included in regular ticket, you don’t need to buy extra tours/packages  online, they can be bought once you get there if you feel you need them.  
Dinner in restaurant overlooking lions was a treat."
"The hotel is absolutely da bomb . Love every little bits about the details, the lobby , the room, the bed , the balcony view , the toilet . Everything. Recommended"
We stay for one night there and it was amazing. Many thrilling activities there. They don’t leave you for a second without entertaining. Good staff and very well maintained. Must include in your Bali trip.
"I love everything in this hotel.  All areas are clean, the staff were so friendly, the food was so delicious, I will definitely come back!"
"My daughter and I stayed at Mara lodge and we were both more than happy with our stay.  The staff at reception and the Tsavo restaurant were so friendly and welcoming, which made our stay more enjoyable.  The rooms were clean, neat and we particularly loved seeing the zebras roaming in front of our room. 
I hope to come back again."
"Wonderful to see the care and great condition of the animals. All experiences were great particularly the Night Safari! Highly recommend doing this if you stay at the lodge. Room was very nice and clean, a little dated but the view to the animals far out weighs this!"
"Absolutely amazing 
Just do it"
This resort is just perfect with toddlers. Children can be engaged all day with various activities in the park and the rooms overlooking the animal park are also fabulous. The food at the restaurant is great and the only small downside is that the menu is limited. Overall a lovely stay so far.
Best to come at morning and expirience the safari.. And then rest and continue in the evening. On the next day you can relax at the hotel.. Overall everything is nice and recommended
Extremely kind and friendly staff.  Room view is amazing. Option for early morning elephant ride from hotel room to breakfast restaurant is fun. Safari attractions a short walk away.
"Really nice , great location and value for money,  can see animals very closely , nice pool"
it's an excellent place to expose children to animals and the evening show was great! 7pm animal photo taking at the hotel lobby allow children to touch and interacts with the animals freely.
"My son really happy stayed in this hotel. We stayed on twiga room, our view is giraffe and zebra - so amazing. Food at restaurant is"
"If you want to try different place to go with the kids, so we can stay here. Our kids will see and learn about animals. A lot of journey for young kids in here. My kids love this place so much."
"It was a amazing experience staying in the safari. The admission ticket to the safari is included, which makes it a great deal.  
Being able to see the animals from the room is a very interesting experience. You could feed the animals too, they are so adorable. Recommended stay!"
"Absolutely Amazing in every way 
A must do experience"
"We stayed Mara River lodge 3-4 Oct. 2020 for one night. 
We enjoyed the safari journey and the animal shows (it was really great more that our Expectation!) all the facilities inside safari and Mara River lodge. 
Just want to input they have to do more maintenance of the hotel swimming pool area(garden etc.) 
We love to have our breakfast in the Lion restaurant, all the staff are really friendly and polite they gave us their best services all the time.
We hope that all the animals are healthy in there and definitely we’ll be back there soon. 
Thank you for the kind hospitality we had a wonderful weekend!"
This was one of the best stay! The room was amazing. We had a safari vibes during our stay. The amenities was fantastic. Truly love the hotel. Highly recommended.
Great place to stay the place and staff were fantastic will deffinatly be staying again
"This was a fantastic experience. The animals are great and the staff are so friendly and experienced in looking after their customers 
Highly recommend"
Wonderful cage experience. Nice exposure to animals. It was fun
Hotel with a view. My children love having snak at the balcony overlooking at the animals
Everything is superb.
"Stayed in the Twiga 1-Bedroom Deluxe Lodge alone for 1 night in celebration of Lunar New Year.  Love the room which gave a clear view of the animals right from the balcony - magical morning!  The bathroom was under natural sunlight and all toiletries are been provided for.    However was quite disappointed that there is no way for me to feed the animals directly from the balcony as all the carrots provided in the room to feed the animals ended up in the water - it was simply too far for me to throw to the animals.   
Will also like to convey my thanks to the male staff in Tsavo (very sorry, he told me his name but I did not note it down) who helped to arrange the 'Private Breakfast with Giraffe' for me alone, although it was meant for couple.   Great appreciation to him to offer to check with the restaurant manager whether to allow the flexibility to do the breakfast for 1 pax ( (which one of your female staff told me firmly that I have to pay for 2 pax even though it's only me alone).  Thanks to the restaurant manager who allowed it too.  So glad to be able to have a beautiful breakfast on the first day of rabbit year with handsome giraffe, Singo
Feedback - prior to staying in, I did email to enquire about 'Feeding the Predator' programme, however was only told to refer to the park schedule.  When I arrived to check-in at around 12noon, was told that my room was not ready and  'Feeding the Predator' was almost fully booked.   However since I was not able to go to my room and I had a heavy carry-on shoulder bag with me which I do not want to carry with me to feed the predator, I decided to go for  lunch at Tsavo first while considering the options and plan the various schedule for the day.  After the lunch at around 1.30pm, I was able to go to my room to put down my heavy carry-on shoulder bag and went to reception to register for the 'Feeding the Predator' but only to be told that it was fully booked! I was just wondering can all these activities be better manage"
Best safari/resort experience of my life
We had such a great time ! We celebrated my son’s 3 years old birthday here . All the staffs are so nice and friendly . They made our stay unique and unfortunately.  We definitely will come back and spend more time there next family holiday !Thank you for all the arrangements .
You only need to stay a couple of nights to get the experience! It’s amazing - the interaction with the animals is unreal and waking up to them is beautiful! Must do!
We stay here every family holiday to Bali and it never disappoints.. The hotel and staff are amazing.. Using the hotel as a base means you can explore the Bali Safari Park at your leisure.
"It was an amazing experience. Clean room and so close with animals. 
Delicious breakfast in Tsavo resto, accompany with cute lions"
"Close to nature and animals. We were given a basket of carrot for us to feed the zebra / rhino everyday. Able to view tigers, lion real close. But need to bring insects repellant."
"Value for money but breakfast is not upto the mark for Indian Vegetarians.
Kindly book Swiga Category rooms and take Center Room for best view of animals."
"Good experience, but the family suits don't have animal view. Hope next time we stay closer to the animals."
Unique experience and well worth doing the night safari.
"Really enjoyed staying for 2 nights and waking up to Rhino’s, Zebras, giraffe and Wilder Beast in front of our room also feeding them with carrots that are supplied and throwing towards the animals to feed. 
Definitely would come back to stay"
Just leave a luggages at lobby and enjoy the facilities while before checking in. Time running out if u Chk in 4/5pm and check out next morning. Atleast must enter at the afternoon and leave next day afternoon. It’s really suitable for kids and I enjoy so much
"We enjoyed our stay at the 3-bedroom villa, loved the facilities and close proximity to the animals! It was a unique experience! My only complaint is the quality of the food during breakfast and the lack of drinking water in the villa. Other than that, enjoyable stay!"
Great hotel atmosphere with a buggy service to get to places. Amazing experience to be so close to the animals. Staffs are all very helpful and informative as well. We definitely enjoyed our time here!
Nothing's nicer than waking up to wild animals in your front yard.
"Really regret never spend more time to safari. Remember must arrive 12pm, and check out next day 12pm only can spend more time to pool play, walk, safari, show"
This was my third stay at this beautiful place it’s peaceful and well run the animals roam wild and are well looked after. The shows are educational and talk about the need for conservation
"Had a lovely stay at Mara River.  The unit was  a bit dated, but spacious and clean.  The bed very comfortable and good water flow in the shower.  It was great to listen to the sounds of the lions roar.  The restaurant is right next to the lion enclosure.  It was awesome! The pool overlooks the game area too, so you can swim and watch the zebras, rhinos etc at the same time.  Food was quite good.  We stayed 2 nights.  So glad we did to take full advantage of the park and its facilities."
The experience we gained here is really worth it. It just that one of the room we were given was at the end corner and the balcony had not so nice view and lack of privacy because people from the front room can see us at the balcony. But overall it was good. Staf were all very attentive and helpful. My son and us had a great time.
We had an amazing experience at Mara River & Safari. Truly one of the best safaris we’ve been to. Keep it up!
Very suitable for families with young toddlers. Choose the rooms facing inside on the 2nd levels for a better view of the animals.
children will love this and the adults to share it with them
Stopped for 3 nights & amazing place to stay with amazing night safari
"Quick to rectify any problems that arise, the staff are extremely friendly and efficient, and go the extra mile to ensure guests are well taken care of.
In our 3D2N stay, we only encountered 1 sour-faced and rude female staff in the Animal Show food counter (she was tending to the cashier that sells ice-cream). Besides that, everyone else was always ready with a smile, to help you.
The rooms and bathrooms can seem slightly rundown but that’s the whole African safari theme, so it fits but we still felt that they could have given the bathrooms and toilet bowls a good scrub down. 
Problem can be easily solved if you’d just put on your own bath slippers around the room, or use their bedroom slippers provided in the wardrobes.
There are some flies in the room, but we have gotten very skilled in killing insects in the 3 weeks we have been holidaying in Bali, so that didn’t bothered us too much.
Certain foods in the Tsavo restaurant weren’t that fantastic in the breakfast buffet - the pastries were not fresh; and in the ala carte menu - the chicken noodle soup off the kids’ menu was instant noodles topped parsley and shallots and priced restaurant rate.
The wonderful thing about this safari is that you really get to come up close with the animals - something you will never be allowed to do in world-class zoos that champion conservations. This alone makes all the discomforts somewhat worth it.
Though we didn’t quite know what to feel about people being able to smoke right next to the baby orang utan in its playground.
There is a theme park within the fun zone - the theme parks had only 2 operating rides - and each ride cost IDR 30,000 per person. We took just the water ride with the boat & we were the only guests in the whole park.
The elephant show was a series of trumpeting and piercing gunshots over bad sound system, so come with ear plugs.
The tigers are magnificent. Do watch the shows."
"It's a new experience we can stay very close to the animals. We can feed them from the balcony and see them from the window. We satisfied with the staff service and the facilities, the issue is only about the room. The room kind of old and very dusty, it need to deep clean by myself since i'm allergic to dust. The breakfast very little selection but most of it quite nice. They only have 1 resto for BF, lunch and dinner but their food delicious."
"Plus: Our young kids enjoyed the stay. Close up with the animals helped them to learn and appreciate wild life and nature. There were many activites for kids from feeding the animals, animal shows, water park and so on. The staff were helpful and accomodating. 
Room for improvement: Can consider using eleectric vehicles for the night safari feeding as the animals were breathing the exhaust fumes daily. The roof of the room was leaky due heavy rain."
"Nice rooms but animals aren’t as close as they appear in the photos which was disappointing because that’s why we decided to spend the night, pool is nice though and has a view of the animals when they are down that end of the yard."
"I would recommend just to stay for 1 day, as the hotel is really really very old"
Stayed 3 nights 2 would’ve done. Stuck with restaurant which was just ok.Animals looked  bored but what they are trying to do for their survival and study is rewarded
Enjoy the safari resort! Good ambiance
Stayed one night and staff were nice and friendly. Taken to the room it was outdated and needed a major upgrade . Pool was a great experience with the view of the wildlife and all the animals looked really well and clean surroundings. Kids really enjoyed and loved the stay and so did we . Good dinner with the lion and very well priced. I think the resort is renovating some rooms around the resort which would be great .
"The resort is right inside the safari, it's great for families with young kids. 
They have water park, pool and various food choices in their restaurants. 
We stayed in Swala room (which was not the correct room we've booked) the room is spacious enough for the children to play & run around. I would advice to avoid using 
The bed is really comfortable and clean. The pillow it's too soft for us ):
The toilet is spacious but the toiletries provided were moldy, the walls were not clean."
"Great place to spend a few days would have given it 5 stars apart from room not ready at check in had to wait 30 mins and eventually changed rooms to accommodate us but the second bedroom air on was noisy and inefficient hence guests in this room had an uncomfortable night.
All in all a fabulous stay with animal view from the balconies.
Would recommend staying here!!!"
It’s a great experience for kids especially waking up to feed the zebras. Just 1 day would be enough to stay here to check out all the activities.. wouldn’t recommend more than a one night stay and a whole day there.
Great location and experience. Room’s definitely need some upgrading and quite a few experiences/things still shut within the park (but still being advertised). The toilet in our room overflowed sewage all through the bathroom.. but other than that the kids loved it
"The place and animals were all great.
If you are afraid of lizards and gecko then this is not a place for you.
The toilet is fill with lizards.
1 night we had an uninvited guest gecko in the middle of the night making loud noise near our bed.
Had to call the front office at 5.15am to get that out of the room.
Breakfast is simple not so fantastic.
Would give 3 star rating."
The way they are take care of animals and the Tsavo Lion Restaurant is so pretty and the staffs are so amiable. The only drawback is that the food kept as refreshments in our room were not informed earlier that it was not free and we had to pay for the ones used.
"Actually when its not on pandemic would be better, there will be night safari etc. but not its very quiet like there were no one around at night, so basically theres nothing to do until safari journey on the morning, since its far from other places"
Beautiful experience but it certainly isn’t like the photos. The place is tired. And needs a good clean and tidy up. Looking out to the animals was lovely but it was also in need of some care. It felt dirty. The restaurant is a great experience sitting there with the lions however it felt very dirty. The food is not great. Had the buffet dinner uncles with the night safari $100Aus. That was worth doing but it’s only about 25mins. Then a not so great buffet. Breakfast was also a buffet and not nice at all. Honestly I loved the experience but I was happy to leave less than 24hours later. The pool area is in need of love too. This place has amazing potential but it needs a lot of TLC.
Was good for 1 night to get the experience
Not really impressed....big dollars and fundamental mistakes.
"At check-in staff played game that Agoda just canceled my reservation and they had to treat our stay as a walk-in with obvious significantly higher price rate.  Totally unacceptable scam, I had verbal argument in lobby over it."
"Arriving at the Mara River Safari Lodge was one of the BEST welcome experiences that I have ever had. The staff couldn't have been more helpful when checking me in and informing me of anything and everything that I could possibly need to know. 
They reserved a table for me with the most amazing view of the lion's while I dug into a delicious 3 course meal in there Tsavo Lion Resturant. 
In the morning they gave me the best view of the meerkats for me to enjoy my buffet breakfast which was equally as delicious as my dinner.
The waiting staff were so attentive and friendly through out both of my dining experiences.
The Safari Park was a 30 second walk from the Mara River Safari Lodge and very easy to navigate around. The timings for the Sarafi Tour's and Shows were spot on so that you could see everything. 
I would definitnely go back to Mara River Sarafi Lodge any day of the week =D"
"we stayed at the mara river safari lodge for our son's 2nd birthday and this would have been the highlight of our trip. 

as check-in was not until the afternoon, we arrived early to pick up our tickets to the safari park that were inclusive with the room. and after enjoying a day at the marine and safari park we were escorted to our room 223 by a buggy (which i think was the highlight of the kids trip). 

rooms were large, clean and were full of character; with a view of the gardens and pool from our balcony. we requested two cots for our boys 2 yrs and 8 mths which were lovely wooden ones; a little small for our two year old which was not a problem as we pushed the two singles together so our 2 yr old slept with our eldest daughter, and the cot acted as a safety rail- perfect! 

staff more than happy to assist anyway they could including walking to our room in the pouring rain to collect umbrellas so we did not get wet. helping with the pram and the holding the kids hands; above and beyond (and greatly appreciated).
staff in the restaurant lovely and went to the effort of organising a birthday cake even with late notice. staff came out banging utensils and singing happy birthday. awesome! our son also took to one of the male staff members, following him around everywhere. lots of fun, high fives and cuddles. we were disappointed that we forgot his name and he did not work breakfast. and the view of the lions is an experience one doesnt get to see very often if at all. drinking right next door to our table, roaring, play fighting...an experience we will never forgot and one we may have to share again with the kids when they are older.

overall we were very happy and have already recommended to our friends. the only thing we were slightly disappointed about was that our balcony was not facing the animals; and we were not able to share our bucket of carrots with any of them but that was a very minor thing that did not affect our stay."
"we had a great visit - we were able to see all the attractions of the safari park over two days, when only staying at mara river lodge for a single night. we arrived early on the first day and left our bags at the lodge and then were able to see all the animals and shows over the next two days. 

accommodation did not include access to the bali theater production, which was very professional and well presented, with animals included and great costumes. highly recommend this, but it did cost an extra usd pp. some mara river lodge guests did have access to this, possibly they booked directly and paid more?

otherwise be aware that the visitors to the safari park have different levels of access, we were able to use the 'hippo' level seating at shows (indicated by yellow seats and benches) which put us front and centre at the shows. check this entitlement with the lodge when they check you in (possibly we were just lucky)."
"Mara River Safari Park a little bit of Africa in Bali! Our room was comfortable with very quiet aircon, however the bathroom is designed to give an open air feeling including the heat.  This made it quite uncomfortable when showering etc but this is the only downside to the room.  We had a lovely view to watch rinos, zebras, wildebeest etc roaming outside our room.  The restaurant provided excellent food, however if you don’t like sweet cold drinks you must ask for no sugar as sugar syrup is automatically added. It was fantastic to watch the lion pride while having meals or drinks. We had a photo taken with the baby tiger which we were also able to do later in the evening as an animal is brought to the lobby each night and the night we stayed the baby tiger was on show.  We did the night safari and were able to feed and pat the zebras and also feed the lions.  The safari park is easily walked around.  We had facials and massages in the spa and they were the best we had experienced in Bali and were not expensive at 25USD for an hour each. It was enjoyable having a drink in the pool and watching the animals although the pool temperature was warm rather than cold."
Mara River was a great experience .  4 of us stayed for 2 nights in two one bedroom lodges and wished that we had been staying an extra night .  We were on the ground floor which gave you an advantage when they walked the elephants by in the early morning .  Upstairs would have been a little better for the view over the park which was beautiful at sundown .  The rooms were lovely with 2 air conditioners which was great .   Every evening between 7-8pm the staff brought a surprise  animal to the hotel lobby for the guests to view and interact with .  We were very lucky as the 1st night it was a young elephant and the last night of our stay it was a baby tiger who was very mischeivious trying to escape fron the handlers .  Breakfast was so enjoyable as the Tsarvo restaurant which walls the lion enclosure gave you a chance to see the pride of Lions at their  most active time of the day before the Bali heat of the day settled in.  We also did the night safari which was extra but well worth it . Again the Staff who took us on the safari ride were helpful and very friendly.  Cannot wait to return again next year
"what can i say about this place but awesome!  this is a great place to stay, the rooms are nice and clean with an amazing view over the safari park.  if you book through agoda you get the entrance into the bali marine and safari park, a free safari ride a photo with either the baby lion or orangutan and yummy buffet breakfast at the cool tsavo restaurant (eating your breakfast while looking into the lion enclosure.  the staff were so friendly and helpful and i highly recommend staying at mara river lodge rather than just do a day trip to the safari park.  we even got to feed the rhinos and the elephants from the swimming pool (where in the world can you do that!"
"We stayed at Mara River Safari Lodge for one night on Friday 1 March with our whole family.  We booked five rooms, two Kifaru and three Swala.  All the rooms were fabulous, plenty of room and such a great view of the Rhino's.

Breakfast was very nicely presented and a good variety served.   

Lunch and dinner at Tsavo was great with the backdrop of several lions lounging around and the Meerkat enclosure.  Prices a bit higher than anywhere else but certainly good food.

Staff were very friendly and extremely good with our 5 grandchildren, even bringing an elephant to the lobby area for the kids to feed and then sit on.

Second time we have stayed here and will continue to do so."
"The team at Mara River have a passion for their roles. The presentations are informative and well organised and run to a timely program allowing time to see each one without rushing.  They are presented in English , easily understood and done with good humour and positivity. There is a large array of animals  to view, we particularly enjoyed the Day Safari ride around the park as you are able to see a huge variety of animals up close.  The staff at the lodge provide excellent customer service and value clientele.  Nothing is too much trouble and always with a happy smile. They even performed the fire dance in the pouring rain with enthusiasm and big smiles, a very dedicated and professional team. The animals appear to be well cared for, well nourished and without signs of stress.  The keepers appear respectful and genuine in their care of the animals. We thoroughly enjoyed our experiences and overnight stay at Mara River Lidge Safari Park and happily recommend to others."
"greatly enjoyed our stay at the mara river safari lodge hotel. great location set in the middle of the bali safari and marine park, unique type of room and nice bathroom with lots of natural light. very nice swimming pool and pool area. all areas of the hotel have a view of the safari park and it was really nice seeing rhinos and zebras from the room and the pool and watching the lions while having breakfast or dinner. however, 2 to 3 nights is enough to stay in this location."
"South Africa Safari is beautiful, Mara River Safari Lodge is even better... 
Thanks for upgrading us to a higher hotel room, also thanks to the musicians drumming up to celebrate my mother's 86th birthday, lovely cake not to mention the Lion just next to her, truly an awesome close encounter experience of her life. 
She really enjoy herself, thanks again to all the hotel staffs especially the conceige & restaurant managers. 
Cheers!

"I've always wanted to go on an African safari but I've never found the time. My overnight stay at Mara River Safari Lodge showed me what it could be like. Waking up to see zebras grazing on the grass outside my room was amazing. Loved the experience of seeing lions, tigers, elephants, rhinos, etc. up close. I went by myself but I definitely want to go back and bring my nieces with me. They'd have a blast. As for the hotel itself, the service was excellent and the staff even gave me a birthday surprise. Its location is fairly remote (there's really nothing to do around the immediate vicinity. You'd need a driver to go to the restaurants outside the park or to the beach) but I didn't want to leave the park anyway."
"My travelling buddy and I were amazed with how friendly the staff were during our stay in Mara River Safari Lodge Hotel. We reached there at about 1-2am, and the staff still greeted us with wide smile and served us welcoming drink. The safari was very well maintained. The food were awesome. Its an ideal suggestion for all including family travelling with young kids. We love it a lot."
"We loved our stay at Mara River Safari Lodge. This was our second visit to the Safari & Marine Park, but this time decided to stay at the lodge. This definitely provided us the best value for money to package our accommodation and our tickets to the Safari & Marine Park. Would definitely recommend this for future travellers to Bali."
Our overnight stay at the Bali Safari Park and Mara River Safari Lodge was certainly a highlight of almost 20 trips to Bali.  From the moment we arrived we were treated as special guests and had an incredible time.  From the night safari feeding the zebra to having dinner with the lions in the restaurant.  An experience not to be missed.
"overall we really enjoyed our overnight stay in mara river hotel and enjoyed that the price includes entry to the safari park. i had stayed before and visited the sarari park a few times and love it. we were disappointed that on arrival at reception, we were informed that the swimming pool was closed for repair. also that our agoda voucher was room only. i take responsibility that i didn't notice that i had booked the price which did not include breakfast. then we enquired about booking on the night-tour and we were told that we would also have to pay extra for the agung show. only to find that no one checked or collected tickets to either and we could have actually done these for free! uma restaurant in safari park has some great lunch options and only around aus$5. enjoyed a lovely dinner and dessert at tsavo lion restaurant for aus$25."
"Being at the Mara River Safari Lodge was like going home to my beloved Africa and being in the Kruger Park, to wake up to rhino in my back garden eating plants was absolutely amazing.  To have the choice at breakfast to watch the lions or the hungry hippo was fantastic and such a buzz.  The place was clean, so much to do and the staff were helpful friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  I have stayed here on several occassions and each time I stay I stay for longer, just cannot get enough of the place."
This was my first time at the Mara River Safari Lodge and i have been coming to Bali on and off for some 20years. I had a wonderful experience and will certainly come again and strongly recommed it to my family and friends. I loved the way that the facilities are designed to take advantage of viewing the animals in their natural enviornment.
"It was a very nice experienced for my family to stay at Mara River Safari Lodge Hotel. Friendly and helpful staff made our vacation more fun. The food was okay (we expected more), yet BBQ after night safari was very tasty.
My 2 years old daughter was so happy to see wild animals every time she woke up and heard birdsong, even lion's roar. She enjoyed feeding rhinos, elephants, and zebras from our balcony.
The best thing was we can took a rest during our activities in Bali Safari. Fun and very relaxing."
"This is my third visit to Mara, and will no doubt visit again!
My first visit was solo, then with my 22yo son, then with hubby.  They loved it too!
The attraction is the Safari Park -- the accommodation allows free entry into the park.  I have found this a relaxing way to really get the most out of a visit to the Safari Park without rushing in and out in a day.  All three times I have also done the night safari - a bit pricey...but worth it!
The accommodation is a bonus.  Simple but elegant rooms done in safari hut style that look onto the savannah. Zebra, Rhino & Wilderbeast within metres of your room??? Amazing!  
The pool is nice...overlooking the savannah as well...it's hard to explain...but special!
The restaurant has huge glass windows to watch the lions, meerkats & porcupines (again...amazing!!!).  And while the prices are high for Bali meals, very reasonable and good quality in my standards (hey...we had juicy NZ steaks and a couple of beers for around AUD$55 for both of us...that would be a bargain in Oz!)."
"The Mara River Lodge was the best hotel I have ever stayed in! My husband and I are BIG animal lovers and this hotel gave us experiences we will never forget! The room was spectacular, just walking in I felt like I was in an African hut, from the raised walkway surrounded by beautiful flora to the mosquito net over the bed and the beautiful decor. Then you go out on your balconey and see the animals!!! Zebras, wildebeast, onyx and Nelson, the white rhino grazing right in front of you. Absolutely spectacular!!!  Then you eat at the restaurant and you are sitting right next to the lions, unreal! They roar, they roll around, they play, they are so natural and so is their environment. And the people cannot do enough for you. We asked where we could purchase a razor and they actually went off the site to buy us one. That's service! We went straight to the lobby every night to play with the baby animal they bring. We actually played with Tsunami, the orangutan for 1 whole hour!!!! An unforgettable experience and dream come true for us. We will definitely stay there again and would recommend it highly to any animal and nature lover!"
Very scintillating
"Was A great experience to have with my granddaughter, with a close up experience with all the animals feeling like you’re right in the jungle"
"We had a great stay.
We were in a 2bed family room & these did not have views over the safari, so we could not see animals from our room, which was disappointing as staying previously in the Swala room, we did have views.
There are golf carts that you call to pick you up from your room & take you to reception/restaurant, as the 2bed is located at the end of the property & this was fun for our child.
You get access to the safari park which is great to be able to come and go as your please.
I highly recommend booking the Jeep Safari, as you get to feed the animals through the jeeps window, which was a highlight."
our children enjoy staying at the hotel and feeding the animals. recommend for family with young children!
"We spent 1 night here visiting the safari park and it was very good , nice room overlooking the park with giraffes, rino,s and zebras wondering about"
"It is 4 star hotel in the middle of Bali Zoo. It is an amazing experience to stay in the zoo and see the animals from your balcony. Also the viewing experience from their restaurant is superb. 
However, the animals are quite far from the balcony and not as close as it looks in the pictures. Also the restaurant should have some options for Vegetarian food."
Excellent stay a night or two value for money than going for a day trip great for kids to watch real animals live from U room restaurant great meals and prices not to bad staff excellent 👌
"We got the room with the giraffe view where it’s walking distance from lobby area. Therefore very easy access to the safari also the restaurant and all. Basically once you enter the premises, there’s no point of going out. They have everything covered. The food here is good. My package only include breakfast but not dinner. But you can order the food at the lion restaurants with the menu provided. Price is almost similar with those restaurant in Seminyak. You basically living inside the safari, but surprisingly our room doesn’t smell even though we can see the giraffe directly at our balcony. The zebra is the other side of the hotel. We can see the zebra and rhino when we go to the swimming pool. The room facilities is ok, but the package I took included safari access and also their water park access. My girl loves the park so much that she would like to go twice. So 2 days 1 night should be sufficient while day 1 you can enjoy the water park and day 2 the safari. Basically the safari able to cover in one day. The cage feeding and animal feeding is not included. However you may pay abit just to get the basket to feed the animal. I nvr thought I would literally feed a real giraffe before. 🙌🏻 they got a lot of shows and activities that you may refer to the timetable. Most of the show are free entrance. The fire show at night are not bad, my girl enjoy it a lot. Thank you Mara Safari for making our little family trip an awesome one. 💕"
Everything ok.  Only buffet food was bad. Food very normal & not hot enough.
"Clean room, comfortable bed, cold air conditioning,  friendly staff. Everything is just best! Can you imagine how amazing when you on the bed and facing a giraffe! Buffalo and zebra just beside it, you can look at them all the day! 
Cons:
Far located from town, only one restaurant for dinner."
Exceed my expectations done the night Safari too definitely worth it.  Will be back to see the marine park when it opens.
