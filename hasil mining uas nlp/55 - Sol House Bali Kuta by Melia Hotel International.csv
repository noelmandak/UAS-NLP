Column 1
"This hotel is located behind Kuta Point, offers you a simple yet complete hotel facilities. There's a spacious pool at the center that suits for kids as well. Our room was located in new building, it's clean and spacious. AC is verryyy cold, maybe because it's a new building. Amenities are not in room, but you can ask hotel to provide it.
Location wise: superb!
Not a beachfront hotel, but beach is walking distance and you can also window shopping while walking to the beach since there are many local shops nearby.
Breakfast is good.
Staff is friendly and quite helpfull.
Definitely recommended :)"
"Loving the pool bar, great location, great buffet breakfast, it's clean and tidy, great staff."
"All staff at this resort including the gardeners, maintenance, front desk, house keeping and restaurant staff go out of their way to help you with what you need and always with a friendly smile. Even though this hotel is rated at 4 stars, it is as good and better than some 5 star hotels we have stayed at. The customer service is what makes this place. I recommend this place and give them 5 stars. We will stay here again."
"I ve been there more than 5times,
Staffs are very kind and good location"
"The smaller pool was perfect for the kids and the shallow steps and area around the pool bar were good too. We were able to have a drink in the pool and have the kids close. We had three pool view Xtra big rooms and one garden view room. The xtra big rooms were modern and the pool view balcony was great. The garden room was quiet and very big. Our family liked both. Beds are super comfortable and breakfast had good choices so everyone found food they liked. Staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed from the 16th of August to the 6th of September and had a fantastic experience. The hotel is 2minutes walk from the beach, discovery mall, beachwalk mall, waterbom park, legion street and other shopping streets.  I got some dentistry work done at ARC dentists which are close and highly recommended. The delicious Bali Bakery is right in front too!
Excellent hotel choice."
"Stayed at this property years ago loved it. 
Was very quiet due to just reopening after covid but am very disappointed  that they must not of cleaned the mattress. After 2 nights my body was covered in bed bug bites."
"We had a good experience with this hotel, will come back again."
"Great hotel. Stayed last year as well. Fantastic location close to the centre.. Staff are friendly, rooms clean and breakfasts are yummy.  Good value for money. New nail place in the shopping  lane leading to the hotel does the best  foot massage for $6 (AUS)."
It's hard to find anything wrong with this hotel. All the staff here go out of their way to help out and make your vacation perfect. Because of the staff I would definitely recommend this hotel and up their 4 star rating to a 5 star. We will stay here again.
Fasilitas hotelnya lengkap. Nasi Gorengnya enak banget
"Enjoyed our stay, loved lounging at the pool , ordered room service first night dessert was delicious, good location across from markets and walking distance to shops, will return if in Kuta, only issue was we called reception to spray room for bugs and they say they would send somebody and no one showed ended up falling asleep, otherwise pretty happy here"
"It was on renovation venue, but we got upgraded to the deluxe pool access. The price is reasonable at the time we travelled. Great location, near kuta beach."
Nice hotel and Good breakfast... 👍🏻
"Absolutely love sol house. We stayed in a big house room 304 which I highly recommend.  Great  location, pools, staff, breakfast and rooms are so clean. Only downfall swim up pool bar drinks  are to expensive $8 for a Bintang."
"The hotel doesn't look like a hotel from the outside because from the road what is seen is a small shopping center (Kuta Point).
But once we pass Kuta Point entrance, the inside where the hotel is, is very big. Plenty of space for facilities and gardens. The bedrooms are spacious. 
The location is very good. We get the quietness we need to unwind and relax but at the same time, once we step out of the hotel, we are very close to the beach, the good restaurants, shopping centers, Waterbom. Superb!"
Room and bathroom were very nice and clean. Breakfast is like bufet. Plentiful choise. Pool area is nice and lots of shade is available. I would stay here again.
"Front Office staff are very helpful & cheerful. Special mention to Ibu Dayu. She is an exceptional person. Upon checking in, she makes you feel very special by her kind words. Always addresses guest by name! Buffet breakfast verities is good. Location is hotel’s main selling point. Just minutes away you can find Restaurants, Cafes, Spas, Laundry shops, etc. Guest rooms are large, clean & comfortable. They come fully equipped with toiletries, instant coffee, tea and fluffy towels. This hotel comes highly recommended."
"This hotel is very central in Kuta. It is an older hotel but it is very pleasant. It is set back from the street which makes it very peaceful and quiet. The staff are excellent, the pools are wonderful, and everything in Kuta is only a short walking distance away.  I recommend this hotel as excellent value."
"Front Office staff is very friendly & helpful. Bellman is very efficient. Location of hotel is just 10 minutes walk to Jl Katika, where you find plenty of Cafes, Restaurants, Massage & many more. Buffet breakfast is simple but sufficient. Very good hotel. Value for money 🤠"
"You will not be disappointed. The all you can eat breakfast is spectacular with lots of staff to bring you coffee or anything else you need or want. All of the staff including the yard maintenance, house keeping, front desk, and restaurant workers are the best you will find in any hotel, always with a big smile and a greeting, and always ready to help with any questions you might have. I recommend Sol by Melia in Kuta. We will stay here again."
Worth every penny
Great location and good value for money.  First time staying here since renovations. Didn't stay in one of the new rooms however the much improved eating area is lovely.  Could do with more shade around the pool areas though.
"we had a big group, staff were lovely, the pools were fantastic, the rooms were clean, the resturnat was being updated, so service was super slow,"
"The location near kuta beach. Easy to access, near to discovery shopping mall and beachwalk"
"Beds comfortable, great breakfast
Sunbeds have towels put on before 7am and then not used until late afternoon"
"I spent 18 nights at Sol,the staff were truly amazing and went out of their way to make everyone happy. 
The only complaint would be the internet, it was slow and most of the time you didn’t get internet at all, apart from that I really enjoyed my stay there and would return"
"Clean room, good breakfast"
"Loved the swim up pool, staff was friendly location was great would stay again"
"With so many hotels to choose from, Sol stands out for its location and convenience. Room is spacious. But the room we stay in (Room 242) needs to be renovated. There is a leak stain in the ceiling of the toilet (no more leak but the stains are not painted). Staff is excellent. Breakfast needs to be varied. We stay for 7 nights and pretty much the same menu for breakfast except for the cakes."
"Two swimming pools and a pool table to entertain the younger children. We have elderlies with us too and they get the bedrooms on the ground floor which is great because there was no lift to the second floor. Location is really excellent. Plenty of eateries, massage places, the beach, Waterbom, shopping center. I love the location."
Great customer Service and definitely very good value for money
Location is near Kuta Beach. About 7mins walk. Near shopping street and eateries. Room was quite dated but serves its function. Clean hotel
"Nice clean rooms, close to the beach, etc. Reception staff seemed a bit unprofessional at times for SOL, didn't seem to care about customer service. One of them provided us with a unusually high price for extending our stay and said there is no availability to book online, just at the hotel, however we found the same room type online cheaper and booked it that way. As we stayed in Legian SOL just down the road the staff there were much more nice and professional.
Pool bar staff were great and the service was good too."
"First time staying here and would highly recommend. Great location, pools, rooms, breakfast and beautiful staff. We will be back 
Only downfall is Pool bar drinks are way overpriced."
"The location is very near tourist spot, easy to find food and market. I stay in Sol big room and its very spacious. Sol have pool and pingpong and my kids like it."
"Great location, not far from restaurants in kuta square, from the beach, and art market.
The room is spacious, but needs more maintenance. Room is a bit dark, and when it was heavily raining the balcony got too dirty from plants and soil."
As Muslims travelers we can enjoy the breakfast without worry.
"My experience in sol by Melia is good. Everything is manage well. Except for the breakfast, the breakfast never change from day to day . I recommend this place for stay but not sure if you want to experience hotel's breakfast"
Wifi not consistent which is important for me. Apart from that pretty good. Stayed here about 5 times before
"Hotel was nice food was tasty and good price we stayed half board  you can either take lunch or dinner 
Down side the pool is quite warm so not very refreshing  staff are really nice and would help you in any way to make your holiday perfect"
"Nice hotel with spacious room and resort style facilities. Easy access to Kuta main streets and the beach. Gracious hospitality from all staffs from the front reception, wait staffs to the gardeners, always greeting you with a smile."
"Affordable hotel in Kuta area, walking distance to Kuta beach,"
Hotel located near to Kuta's shopping area. Walking distance to Kuta beach.
"Pro : big room, comfort bed, location, pools
Cons : cleanliness (many flies outside room and at restaurant), bad choice of breakfast, staffs hospitality
This hotel is not as good as the name of Melia. Don’t imagine that you will have quality like Melia Jakarta. However, compare with the price offered, this hotel is value buy, especially the location. I would like to give special stars for ibu Warni who served us at the restaurant. She served with heart and so sincere 👍🏼❤️
Tips : almost all grab driver don’t know about this hotel, even there’s no this hotel name in grab car. So, you must choose destination “Kuta Point”. This hotel was used to known as Kuta Beach Club."
"Nice location in the heart of Kuta. It's near to Pantai Kuta, Kuta Square, Discovery Mall, Beach Walk Mall and other tourist destination nearby."
Nice hotel with great location. in the middle of kuta area
"For my first night, i was given a room at the old building and it was really uncomfortable with dirty linen, water flask, fridge and towels. I asked for a change and they gave me a room looking over the swimming pool. That made my stay at Kuta so much better. Thanks"
"I found,y experience at Sol overall to be positive while many other found their rooms sub standard and below average. The issue isn’t with the staff who are outstanding and so extremely helpful, the issue is with the owner who is spec fig little to no one’s on maintenance. Unless you stay in a room close to the restaurant you won’t get any Wi-Fi which in todays day and age to do any work and communicate is required. I would stay here again but only in the rooms that’s I checked to ensure I get what I paid for."
"Good hotel, good breakfast.  Overall clean, but like most hotels here when things break they don't repair them they just keep cleaning them. Our vanity was falling apart and the toilet paper dispenser no longer works so they just put a roll on top of it and you have to hold the roll while on the toilet.
All the cooked food except for the egg station is not kept hot so the only item slightly warm is the coffee and tea, but the variety and taste is good. We would stay here again no worries if there was no other similar choices of hotels, but there are."
"-walking distance to eateries
-5 min walk to beach
-5 min walk to Kuta Art Market
-5 min walk to massage, pedi, medi,shops...etc"
"I’ve stayed here several times. The staff are always amazingly friendly. That’s why I keep coming back. 
The gym equipment was all broken in the fitness centre. There was insufficient pool lounge mattresses and umbrellas. The tour desk was asked 3 times to book a tour to Nusa Penida which they never did. Otherwise I enjoy my time here."
"Strategic hotel near KUuta square area, just take a walk for 5 minutes. Lavish and quiet swimming pool. 
Good breakfast nasi goreng or mie goring
Internet connection a bit down due to limited service. 
Best staff services."
"We expected great hotel because of melia connection, but not all hotel area renovated. It is 70's hotel style with garden and bali style. We came to checkin 8 pm, only one staff, fortunately we are the only one to checkin, the process are fast and the only person take our bag to the room. When we checkout at 10 am, no other staff at front desk, we called from room, nothing answer, so we have to bring our bag and process checkout. Maybe lack of staff? We book sol room, it is in the back area, with garden view, room was renovated, but not the fascia and another part. Room quite big, but cleanliness must improve. As we swipe the floor, it was dusty. Bathroom lack of hanger. Breakfast great, but not tasty and not variety. They have parking in basement, as another hotel in the area lack of parking. Hotel area are great, walking distance to many attraction in kuta area. It is just 10 minutes from airport. We think it is not worth the price as we pay about IDR600.000/night, if they sold about 300-400/night will be consider back. Please improve for the future."
"Everything was great. I'd give 8/10. 
Staff very friendly, helpful. 
Location is right on the spot. very close to Kuta square. 2 min walk to Kuta beach. but I'd prefer Legian beach, as it is more clean and not many people trying to hustle."
I stayed here for one night with my son. The location was good and there are plenty of services around the hotel. Pool area was good. The hotel in general is run down and needs lots of work but it was clean and good value for money.
"Okey hotel with big breakfast buffet that was nice. Liked the pancakes, fresh fruit and soup. The fan in the bathroom made a lot of noice, but could be switched of. Stains on sheets. Pool area looked good, especially since the beach not was very nice. Over all Okey stay."
"Average hotel, old buildings, many bugs and mosquitoes in the room and toilet"
"Hotel facility are good.
Understaff so you will see the same person for all of the day.
The breakfast menu are limited and below standard."
"Sol is a good hotel with all amenities you need.  Staff are friendly and rooms are clean. Great location in Kuta a 2min walk to the beach,  mini mart near by, plenty of spas also."
Good location
"Room Facilities are too old and really need replacements. However, location and outdoor facilities are quite good to consider."
"The goodthing is they have variety of breakfast.. 
Good location 
But this hotel is kinda old and pictures are very deceiving.."
Enjoyable stay with big pools for kids
"Had organised free airport pick up no show  air conditioner was working a treat they said it needed yearly maintenance  we allowed leaked severely in room had them return 6 times over 4 days  main pool turned green for the 3rd time  in 12 months was closed off and emptied out
 OF ACTION for 5 days  beer always hot due to fridge in bar and restaurant not working proply great location fantastic breakfast staff fantastic room clean however some guests were moved due to bed bugs overall I wo u l d not stay there again f o r the $110 Aussie I p aid per night"
"This is a hote for you who only want to have a place to sleep. Nothing much to do, not too clean, and they need to do pest control because a lot of mosquitos, spiders and centipides in the room"
"The room is a disaster, very dirty. The room floor is dusty and the wifi does not work. I found centipede on the bed. So we decide to leave at 11pm and book on another hotel. :("
"We need to wait 45 mins for our room. We arrived around 3pm. The double room is not available, so they decided to upgraded us. The rooms are the old ones at the back, bathroom got awful smells, and the water pressure was very weak. At one day, the housekeeping just forget to clean both of our rooms, and we need to call them when we got back by 9pm. With reception desk & housekeeping didn’t answer our calls. So decided to call the restaurant instead. Breakfast time only til 10am, so if you plan to play by the beach, just forget about it. And the breakfast itself, you can say, just mediocre."
"Very bad experience during my stay remaining so many hotel option sorrounding. I believe extremely need extra attention for hotel cleanness since I was stay n sleep with FLY they called ""Buyung"" which so bad they will spray my bed n pillow with HIT Aerosol spray for mosquito and flying insect and I sleep in that bed seriously and Centipede (Kaki Seribu) in bathroom! Please make it better remaining the hotel pool very nice and room spacious, convenience with balcony and location is good in Kuta area."
Not maintaining the cleanlinss. Breakfast is toooo limited
"Staff no care, breakfast ugly and  so many fly so not hygiene."
"I have been to bali many times and stayed in a lot of places, I am happy to say that Sol House Bali is just another perfect place in Bali.  In the middle of Kuta close to shops/markets/restaurants it is ideal for a couple or family.  Breakfast is amazing and so much to choose from, we stayed in the older part of the hotel, I do love old bali why go to bali if you want new!  the rooms where updated and modern and very clean.  Our room was cleaned and tidied everyday, thank you Julian who did an amazing job....  the hotel is quiet even though on a busy street and the staff are very friendly.  The pool was great, really the hotel is value for money.  If you want a nice bit of old bali with the real personality this is where you need to be.  Loved it and will return, next time with our 2 boys. :) It is nice to find those hidden treasures in the middle of Kuta."
"We really enjoy our stay at the Kuta Beach Club Hotel. The hotel is situated in a central location, close to Kuta Beach, Kuta Square, Discovery Centre and Waterboom Park.  I always find the staff extremely friendly, we have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and they remember our names every time.  The pool has easy access for the elderly with wide sweeping steps and a hand rail into the water, plenty of sun beds and clean pool towels when required.  We stay in a delux room with garden views which have been refurbished some years ago.  I find the rooms and the linen clean and fresh as far as Bali Standards are.  They dont use bleach so the linen can be discoloured but clean all the same.  If you are a regular to Bali this is a no issue and standard in most hotels.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for agood value for money stay in a central location.  We find the staff go out of their way and react to the friendly way a guest treats them.  I have witnessed Australian travellers being very rude to the Balinese and this is extremely uncalled for.  A Good Hotel in my view."
"We upgraded to a Poolside room, and it was well worth the extra!!!
This hotel, after 17 Bali holidays, is by far the BEST BALI hotel i have stayed in.
The room is superior in fittings and cleanliness, the pool and gardens are looked after immaculately daily, Breakfast was quick and easy, and the staff especially Jimmy the pool man, where friendly and accommodating. It has a fantastic central location, close to shops, Kuta square/Matahari/Centro and the Kuta nite club area.  Nice to stay in a hotel that doesnt look like a concrete jungle, and has its own tropical charm. Hopefully we will be back soon, and if not next July. :)"
"Could not fault Sol House Bali Kuta, we were given the wrong room when we first got there but the reception staff moved us as soon as they could to a pool view room. The breakfast was great and a good variety of choices. The pool area was a good and very refreshing. The first few days people were putting out towels to reserve lounges before breakfast but it seemed to stop one morning so Im guessing the staff put an end to it thankfully. The staff are amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
"We were recommened by a freind who had stayed at the Kuta Beach Club on umerous occasion and we were not dissapointed. When we first arrived we were taken to a room with 2 single beds joined together and I had booked a double bed with an extra single bed for our 3 year old - there was no hesitation in taking us to a new room which was perfect. We were in the garden area where it was beautiful and quiet you wouldnt even know you were in the heart of Kuta. The staff were friendly the guest were great. I have never been so relaxed. I would definetly reccomend this hotel as it is a short walk from Waterbomb Park, Kuta Beach, Shopping and Restraunts. We cant wait to come back to Bali and would without doubt stay at the Kuta Beach Club again."
"We stayed at Sol after cutting our Ubud part of our journey short, we chose Sol simply because it was for only 2 days and normally wouldn’t stay in Kuta,  but we were looking for something affordable as we had forfeited two nights in Ubud
WOW what a surprise! The whole experience from reception to our lovely room, which was situated down the back, so it was quiet, away from the pool, it was large, as was the bathroom, clean, a lovely balcony.
It was close to everything, whether you wanted to watch sunset on the beach or do some fine dining, my only regret is that we didn’t find Sol sooner"
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Kuta Beach Club Hotel.  We found the staff very friendly.  We had a refurbished room towards the rear of the hotel which was nice and quiet away from the entertainment area.  The hotel has two excellent refurbished swimming pools, one with a swim up bar and the other with a spa.  The main pool has large sweeping steps graduating into the pool with a large hand rail which made it very easy for my aging parents to enter and exit the pool.  This was the main factor in selecting this hotel, because it is user friendly for the elderly as some tiles in Bali are extremely slippery.
The location is great near the Art Markets, Kuta Square, the Discovery Centre and Kuta Beach. I would recommend this hotel for the budget conscious holiday makers and elderly people who enjoy a swim with easy access to the pool."
"This is the second time we've been to Bali and the fourth hotel we've stayed in there. This trip we stayed the full 12 nights at Sol House....and glad we did! In comparison to others we found this fantastic value for money.... Breakfast was lovely and the pool just stunning. We stayed on the ground floor in the newly renovated rooms. The view of the pool and surrounding gardens were so stunning at night I'd just sit outside of our room and admire. Always enjoyed the great choice of pool music. Hotel is close to everything, you really can't go wrong. I can't recommend this hotel enough.... Just can't wait to go back again!! See you next holiday :)"
"Spent 6 nights in the newly renovated Sol House Kuta (formally Kuta Beach Club).
The new rooms were excellent value for money. All new restaurant and soon to be open shops at the front of the resort.
The pool area has not changed but it is very good with excellent swim up pool bar.
Overall I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Kuta Beach Club Hotel, good sized Swimming Pools and Bars, Within walking distance to the nightlife and other Family Attractions. The Rooms were clean and well presented. The Breakfast was sufficient, but there are many eating alternatives within walking distance if you prefer a change. I would definitely recommend this Hotel to other Friends and Family Members. I will definitely be staying there on my next visit to Bali."
"I really liked this hotel for what we needed.  I have stayed at many hotels in Bali, but this trip was just with a bunch of girls and it suited us fine.  

Close to Kuta shops and not far in a taxi into Legian.  It was easy to get to places.  The staff were very friendly, and loved the pool and swim up bar.

Not kettle etc in the rooms, but just call room service and they will bring hot water.  That is my only complaint, everything else was fine :)"
"Bali hospitality is alive and well at Kuta Beach Club. Super friendly and courteous. Rooms were very clean. I chose a quiet room away from the pool. The room had ""blackout curtains"" so I slept like a baby. Strong wifi.  Great laundry service just outside the hotel grounds. Nice restaurants close by."
"The hotel is clean and the gardens are lovely - really nicely looked after. Fish are a nice touch.
The pool is really nice and there are plenty of loungers. Towel card is a bit of a pain but I get the economics of managing the towel return (and the threat of charging $30 if you loose the card). 
The Sol house brand says it's about the music and the vibe but the place is like a ghost town - no party starters or loud music, nothing lively at all, although the poolside playlist is pretty decent.  (although the couple in their 80s I sat next to at Breakfast disagreed.)
Staff in Kuta Beach Club outfits one day and Sol House polos the next pretty much sums it up - they really aren't rebranded yet and are confused. 
Everything about Breakfast is poor, dining room service is poor, quality of food in both Asia and European choices might be the worst I've ever eaten in 9 trips to Bali, In fact we skipped it all together a few mornings which is almost unheard of for us."
"Pay extra for a premier room. These rooms are amazing!! Renovated and very clean! No mozzies either and great air con! A quick walk to the markets and to the beach!! This was my 2nd time staying at the kuta beach club and i would stay there again next time, well located to most things in kuta and great cocktails at the swim up bar. The food isnt amazing but there are soo many places near by to eat, especially blu fin teppynyaki and pizza at little italy in kuta square! Highly recommended ☺"
"Australian solo traveller but with large family group for a wedding, Very enjoyable long weekend in Bali, have been to Bali many times and this hotel was exceptional. Will definitely return to the Kuta Beach Club, pay the extra to upgrade to the newly renovated pool view rooms - excellent."
"I stayed in Kuta Beach for only one night after staying in other parts of Bali and I should say that everything was perfect for me and my buddy. The check in process was quick, rooms are clean and staff was friendly. The location was close to everything, the beach, the markets and food places. Breakfast was normal but it has the neccessaries like toast, cereals and eggs so it was alright for me. The best part was the pool, its huge and fun for kids too so I will definitely be back next time with my two kids!"
"Located in the heart of Kuta yet quiet on premises.  New rooms - mattress firm, new and bedding/towels great condition.  Smart TV has perfect transmission and good English stations including Satanta and various movies.  Buffet breakfast is satisfactory, great pools and small entertainment area (pool and tennis table).  Staff are very friendly and helpful.   I come to Bali 4 times a year and at approx. 80 AUD, I will be returning back ."
"Stayed here on my first trip to Bali 32 years ago. Hotel has had major renovations and is now on par with other 4 star hotels. I stayed in a deluxe room and couldn't fault it on any level. An older room overlooking the garden very tranquil. Will continue staying at this hotel if discounted rate is available again. A little bit overpriced now but I got a great Deal with Agoda.Would recommend this Hotel for singles,couples and families."
"it was awesome as usual, this is our 4th stay at kuta beach club and we will always stay there because of the very friendly staff they always remember our names every year,the location, the value for money, the meals have vastly improved this year and they have the cleanest pools and coldest bintang in bali, and the grounds are always immaculate.
we give kuta beach club 10 out of 10"
"Very nice environment with budget price. 
Close to city (Shopping) area and also beach. All walking distance.
Service was good and food was yummy.
Transportation is still cheap in Bali before petrol price increase in Indonesia. 
Kuta beach is a good attraction for those who wish to have a romantic, rural style & relax trip. Kuta beach offers sunset view, water games, kite flying... etc"
"I was first checked in to an older building. Old tv, old airconditioning system, dimmed lights,no view. I requested to be transferred and was transferred to newer(?) Block which is 10x better with better wifi. The staff are the best tho ❤️"
"We arrived at the midnight, tired after traveling 5 hours, check in, bath and fall sleep,
At the morning my wife complain and show me, a lot of hair some black short hair and some curly hair, pieces of used tissue,
The fitted sheet looks not clean, spots in several place, looks this fitted sheet never change for long time, 
I make a complain after confirm this situation with House Keeping Supervisor, and FO Staff,
Record photo and video, everything point if needed in the future, 
The FO Staff moved us to a new Room, Clean and good, 
But that's experience will never forget, sleep for one night over the dirty fitted etc, horrible, 
The breakfast just so so, omelette with everything, but only a piece of mushroom on that Omelette, 
Looks the Hotel wanna safe everything, included breakfast, 
Not as the class, bad experience,"
"Had a short stay here. The location is accessible enough to avoid heavy traffic and still good, walkable enough to central Kuta area. Facilities are good, also the breakfast buffet but I wish they showcased at least one dish that is native to Bali. The room and the entirety of the hotel looks like renovated but unfinished. They did some make shifts inside the room, but not strong enough as these are just made of plywoods. Also the chair in the room is too old, chairs on the balcony is better than what’s inside. Vault is present but not working. With these findings, room rate is not really worth it."
"+ lokasi dkt pantai n mall, kamar luas,breakfast oke,staf realy helpfull n sangat ramah,swimming pool bersih n luas, definitelly will stay again here..

"The building is very old. The photos are all from the new side but our room was in the back in a very old building. It was disappointing. Everything in the bathroom was broken towel handles, etc"
"Absolutely beautiful  , lovely staff  , great value, great service  , great brekky."
"Excellent value in a perfect location on Kuta. Big, clean rooms, nice pool, great buffet breakfast."
"Clean, good"
"Clean room, good breakfast. 
Just take 10 min walk to go the beach"
"Great location and friendly staff. Beautiful pool area, though often quite busy, with a lack of towels available! Clean and tidy rooms, though a little tired looking. Mine had a slight gap in the balcony door meaning there were constantly mosquitoes getting in! Breakfast was a great spread, but again, very busy and there seemed to always be a lack of cups and plates. Nice hotel, but perhaps a little overpriced by comparison to others in the area"
Ok.
Best for everything
"Would recommend to others!
Pros:
- loved their 24/7 restaurant
- location is walking distance to Kuta beach
- friendly staff especially one of the servers at the resto
- loved the pool, billiard & ping-pong table
Cons:
- no trash bin in the bathroom
- always had to request for extra towels because they keep forgetting there are 3 of us in the room
- requested for hand towels and I was given the dirtiest/stained hand towels I've ever seen (they should throw stained towels already)
- mosquitoes in the room; but oh well, we're in Bali, so I guess it's expected"
"One day before the trip, my grandma was admitted to ICU and in a critical illness. I contacted hotel side to seek their understanding to refund the hotel stay, with a valid document document to show that my grandma condition is in critical, however they rejected. 
This is disappointing."
"Room not that clean smell a bit off. Balcony has no view. No lift ! 
Never stay here again !!!"
"The best hotel i stayed in Bali, the staff are very helpful and kind, great location and very clean.  Will be sure to come again."
A quite little abode in the middle of Kuta.Staffs are excellent & trying their best to assist whenever their assistance are needed.Will come back again!
"It was great time in hotel. Kindly staff and sightseeting was awesome
And then fortunately, i forgot airpods after check out,
Staff find out this, i touched!🥹
I will miss here"
"I booked on a very special rate and found value for money. Room was cleaned spacious,  air conditioning very cool. Tv good choice of Chanel , buffet breakfast has many options and good presentation. The pool table need replacement. Swimming pool not too big.  All essential things are provided, but no box tissue was surprising me. Staff are polite and helpful."
"Won’t stay anywhere else in Kuta , beat value for money, amazing staff, close to everything, very clean, all you need in a beautiful place to stay"
It's right in the main section of Kuta
Great breakfast. Great location. Beautiful Staff. Lovely comfy bed. Wifi a bit slow apart from that everything was perfect 🤩
All good.  Nice pool.
Closed to the beach.
"Fantastic location, lovely friendly staff that did everything you asked for plus more. Only one complaint is the internet connection it was really bad once you got to your room"
"Good location can be noisey
Food okay 
Pool good
