"Overall, our stay at the resort was absolutely amazing. From the moment we checked in, the staff were incredibly attentive and made sure to fulfill all of our requests, including providing a baby cot and adjoining room for our young child and infant. They even went above and beyond by keeping our baby food and milk in the restaurant freezer and bringing it to our room a few times a day.
The resort itself was absolutely beautiful, with so many pools for the kids to explore, gorgeous gardens, and a private beach. The trams were a great way to easily explore the huge complex, and we were able to enjoy all of the facilities at both Rimba Wana and Ayana. Everything was extremely clean and well-maintained.
I would like to give a special shoutout to Gus De, Paul, Fayola, and Iin, who were all incredibly helpful and friendly during our stay. The housekeeping and bellboy staff were also fantastic. It was truly an excellent experience for my family and we can't wait to come back again."
"I stayed with friend for 2 nights in Rimba. This hotel is definitely stunning ! We really enjoyed our lazy time in their private Kubu Beach, they have so many large pools with awesome view (my fave was in the Rimba ones btw), many fantastic restaurants (my fave were the Rock Bar and Luna Bar). During our stay,  we did not need to go out at all, their facilities kept us busy. We really enjoyed the walk paths, it was like walking in the forest; we could always take tram when we were too lazy to walk. Very friendly staffs. Very nice room, of course including the amenities (even though better to bring your own hairdryer). In overall, it was amazing experience for me to stay in Rimba and will definitely come back again! Thanks a lot for giving very nice services and made awesome memories for us!"
"The best part about staying at Rimba is that you get to access all the facilities within Ayana Resort, villa, and Segara as well. You literally do not need to bring any card or cash around as you can charge all of your expenses at any of the Ayana group of hotels to your room. 
The pools are all different and beautiful in their own way. We spent the whole day visiting the different pools and soaking up the sun. The few rooftop bars have amazing views, staff are extremely helpful and friendly.
There's a tram which arrives at each stop every 5min,making it extremely convenient. We even passed by a bunch of monkeys during our ride to the private beach (kubu beach). The hotel feeds them regularly with fruits.
Dont forget to visit Rock Bar too. Reach earlier in order to secure a seat for a sunset view. Absolutely worth it. 
On a side note, even though the buffet breakfast is a little pricey it's very delicious and the spread is huge. Loved it. 
Will definitely visit Rimba again!"
"I dont even know where to begin. Its such a shame we only stayed for a night. Loved everything about the hotel. The staff were super duper pleasant and accommodating, and always at hand to help with anything and everything. Reception was kind enough to upgrade my room to one with a better view, and also obliged my request for a late check out as my flight was in the evening. The room was fabulous, it was even ready early and we managed to check in earlier than planned! Babycot which i requested was also already set up in the room, and so so grateful for this! Special shoutout to Ari for being super helpful. Breakfast was awesome with freeflow iced cappuccino and iced americano (a first for me and definitely won the coffee addict in me over!) We also got to enjoy facilities at Ayana, went down to the beautiful Kubu Beach twice, spent the evening at Rock Bar, spent some time at the Kidz Club, despite only staying for a night. It helped that the shuttles were frequent and efficient, unlike some resorts i’ve been to where shuttles were far and between. All in all, a great stay. My only pickle was that there were many many steps and stairs in both Rimba and Ayana, which wasnt really baby-stroller (and i guess disabled/older people) friendly. Will definitely be back to enjoy the rest of the resort that we didnt manage to see (for example the gazillion pools they have everywhere!)"
"Pros:
warm and responsible staff
Delicious food (Padi/Kisik/Sami Sami/the Chinese restaurant )
Very nice and clean room
wonderful pools
Cons:
Beach could be cleaner
Rock bar: compared to other dinning halls and bars, this place is relatively crowded, which causes a decline on general service and organization
After all, good experience!"
"Magnificent views and fantastic pools and you can catch a shuttle bus to your sister Hotel five minutes away and go through there and use all their pools. You can also take the elevated down to the beach which is secluded for the two Hotel clients. This is the second time this year we have been here, it’s very very nice and very clean with the most stunning gardens and no rubbish to be seen ."
"The best experience staying at Rimba hotel.. especially if you staying with your family, everything about this hotel so far its been mind blowing. The facility, the rooms, the staff, the cleanliness, i mean everything, i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy their holiday to the max."
"Staying in Rimba was the best value for money as guests can access all Ayana five stars facilities. As a frequent traveller (to bali), i can safely say that you can just stay in Ayana to enjoy the best of Bali - their private beach offers similar uluwatu beach experience (and even better with all the helpful and fun staffs and facilities), the rock bar has great DJs and drinks. If you have only limited time off, ayana would be the best choice for you to enjoy bali's best experience."
"It’s in a beautiful location by the ocean. It has several restaurants to choose from for eating out or dining in. You can use on-site gym facilities, go shopping or walk to their private beach, see monkeys along the way. The service is excellent! The Rock restaurant has phenomenal views and is a magical experience."

"Thank you for the wonderful memories and experience. It’s way beyond my expectation. All the staffs from hotel to restaurant been very lovely and helpful. The Ayana estate is really huge and luckily with the tram service provided, i still manage to explore around conveniently. There are many pools available at different resorts and we can access to all of them. Kisik seafood restaurant by the beach kinda amazed me as well, every dishes were taste really good, not to mentioned the perfect location to enjoy the sunset. I know i will be back again."
"I would give 6 stars if I could! We had best time stayed at Rimba, super clean, great atmospheres, pools are amazing, all amenities are quality, staffs super friendly and always go above an beyond, great breakfast. Easily our top pick for next visit."
"We stayed for 4 nights and the experience was top notch. The staff are friendly and professional, every one will say hi to you and 🙏🏻 at you, EVERYONE! 
The resort is so big that you can enjoy breakfast at 2 or 3 places. But even the payed restaurants are all delicious. The front desk of Rimba was very helpful, I only was able to catch one person’s name Paul, he speaks great English and points directions very well. 
Every corner of Ayana was beautiful and instagrammable, everyone recommends the villas pool but my personal favorite is kuta beach club, it’s beyond beautiful, cute cocktails and priceless view!! Limited seats so go earlier :) I really love this place. Ayana rules!"
"I l travel a lot and I love to explore new resorts, Rimba by AYANA is one of the best resorts I have ever stayed! everything is 10/10, the staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating, the rooms are spacious and have all the amenities. The cleanliness is second to none in Bali. It’s fantastic that you have access to all the other areas and facilities of the Ayana estate. I wish I stayed longer in Rimba, will definitely be coming back and staying longer."
"Oh my gosh what can I say, this resort is just perfect. You can spend all day here just to explore the facilities they have! From Rock Bar, infinity pools, private beach, not to mention that the stunning view elevators! Would definitely will come back to explore more!"
"Such a beautiful hotel! Clean rooms and common areas. Pools are stunning and you can access the entire Ayana complex including all their amazing swimming pools via the resorts shuttle bus. The resort also has its own private serviced beach with crystal blue water, safe for a swim and accessible via a lift! And last but not least the sunset from the Rock Bar was the highlight of our stay!"
"Rimba is the most wonderful place to stay when you need a relaxing holiday. The setting, staff, facilities and rooms are amazing. You also get to use all the facilities at the sister resort Ayana and with shuttles every 10 minutes, that is easy to do. We will be back next time!"
"A great first stop for our holiday, you get use of all of the Ayana Resorts making an enormous amount of pools to visit it is like staying in a new resort everyday, we found no need to leave the resort in the 3 days we were there.... amazing staff as always BECAUSE BALI. Food and beverage prices were average to what you might be used to paying back home so just keep that in mind. apart from the a beautiful place to stay and great for kids!"
"If you are staying in Jimbaran, choose Rimba by Ayana Bali.  The room is spacious, clean, it's still new as well. Also the breakfast woww all delicious. But above all the facilities are amazing and the customer service is no words can explain. Will definitely come back again.  Thank you Ayana! 5 star"
"We just completed our 5 night stay at the RIMBA! This property is beautiful with so much to do. I would definitely recommend staying and will be back again, my kids loved the slides. My only recommendation is to ensure you have breakfast included in your room package."
"The hotel might need a refurbishment in the rooms for its scale, however the facilities are great. The best part of the stay is the genuine hospitality of its staffs, everybody is so sincere and genuinely nice. Teja and his team at Kubu beach, hostess team at Rock Bar (i dont remember her name, but she was so patient giving us choices of our preffered tables despite the busy evening), Asmara from Rock Bar. Housekeepers especially, Aris, Tonik, Putu Suputra, we came back to the room after long day and we just found surprise of handmade towels folding (like animals shape) with a little note wishing us a good day, 2 days in a row! It is a small little gesture but really brighten up the mood and show their genuine attentiveness."
"Really have a good stay experience. Enjoyed our stay here. Their area (rimba-ayana-segara, room/villa) are huge.  Any room you choose to stay, you can go within the area to enjoy the facilities using their tram, and choose where you want to have breakfast/ swim/ chilling. Kubu beach is also in the area."
"The hotel is located on Ayana resort, they have many facilities.
Rimba hotel itself have 3 very nice swimming pool.
The room is comfy although a bit small.
You can use shuttle to go to ayana, rock bar, spa.
The staff is nice and friendly.
Overall have a pleasent stay."
"Where else can u find a 98 acre hotel?? Super big, so many facilities, very warm, welcoming and helpful staffs. The biggest bathtub ever in the bathroom. The room is clean as well. Great Aquatonic spa experience. Not to mention there's a mini golf and tennis court inside.
They will take you with golf cart to the beach, cafes, restaurant inside the hotel area. 
Also, Kubu beach is soooo beautiful! It's private beach like it's your own. Clear and transparent water, white sands. Will definitely go back here again one day!"
"Love our stay. Great resort with great swimming pools, breakfast, facilities, friendly staff and comfortable bed. Had to check into the hotel very early on in the morning due to flight cancellation, staff are helpful ( as well as Agoda staff) to help me rectified issue. End up staying another night, and we are already planning for next visit. Thank you for pleasant stay."
"Basically, I'd recommend anyone going to Bali to have atleast 1-2 nights for 'resort day' (go to a nice resort and enjoy all the amenities). 
Rimba clearly have one of the best amenities to do so. Pool is great + private KUBU beach, along with multiple AYANA facilities you can enjoy. Rock Bar also remains one of the best place to enjoy sunset, and they also have ocean pool bar.
Looking for great view for photos? Sky at Ayana. place looks like a dream.
all in all, every cent spent here is worth it. I can see myself making arrangements to go back to stay at Rimba"
"They basically have everything in these resort estate, more than 10 pools to choose, their own private beach, one of the coolest bar for sunset drinks too!
Room also comfortable and clean, however im having a little bit of difficulties in opening their water bottles, so maybe the management should consider finding better and safer alternatives to replace them.
However, its always been one of my go to place whenever i want to just relax and enjoy my time relaxing without having to leave the hotel, so its highly recommended, for both solo traveler or if you’re traveling w family :)"
"The hotel provided the best guest service on all level. Everyone greets and treats you with a smile. The breakfast options, though not that many, was enough, and the servers were very friendly.  The facilities are without a doubt one of the best ones we could expect from a resort. The aquatonic pool spa was a new and exciting experience. When my daughter got stung buy an insect near the kids pool, the staff quickly provided some ice for the swollen area and called a doctor to make sure she had no allergic reactions and gave some medication. The manager on duty responded very quickly to check up on her too.  The whole incident was dealt with professionally by the staffs. They even check up on her later on during the day. It truly shows that they care about their guests. Thank you so much Ayana teams for making our holiday memorable. My kids told me that if we go to Bali again they will only want to stay in Ayana 😄"
"Loving our stay, tons of beautiful places to relax and enjoying the view. Delicious food and super friendly staff. Will definitely be back"
"Rimba is perfect for families esp with young children. They have diff pools to choose from, the kids club is nice, the hotel grounds is expansive. Service is top-notch, the rooms are of good size, the toilet is a bit tight but only because it has a huge, circular bath tub with a rain shower! The water pressure is great. We enjoyed the gym and the ladies’ changing room has both a sauna and a steam room. I actually prefer Rimba over Ayana as it is newer, and the design is more updated. However, you could also enjoy the facilities of Ayana Hotel as well. I also loved Rimba’s Rooftop Bar - the design is so cool with a fantastic view. We also got free entrance to the Aquatonic pool which my hubby and I enjoyed so much. Even though we came here with our adult son, we all enjoyed our stay here very much and would definitely stay in either hotel again. Excellent service too."
"Such a beautiful entrance lobby with stunning pools and access to all of Ayana’s facilities and pools, not to mention the picturesque Kubu Beach and Rock Bar. The staff were accommodating and met all our needs. Rimba East Wing just opened on our 5th day there and we were surprised there is 1 more big pool!   We had a fun time, elderly and young kids and adults. Will highly recommend to anyone wanting to have a respite in Bali. We gojeked most of our meals though we heard the restaurants are not bad too though pricey."
"One of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Really beautiful location with so many restaurants available it was hard to go outside the hotel to eat (though you really should, bali is full of amazing restaurants). In particular I really loved the tandoori chicken we got at Padi. Padi and Damar terrace have really peaceful vibes due to the nearby water features and tasteful music. 
During our stay we were asked to move rooms and due to a minor misunderstanding I ended up making an overpayment. This led to a small amount of frustration prior to checkout but the staff were very apologetic and they took steps to ensure my refund was processed as quickly as possible. 
I will definitely be aiming to stay again if I return to the Bali in the future."
"Stayed for 3 days 2 nights, totally amazed with the place n services.
Will be back.
Just 1 input for the staff who served in Padi, when we had a breakfast on second day, I asked 2 people there whether there was a fresh juice since I need sugar free juice.
Then he told me that all juices were from box which not so correct as Toge restaurant in Rimba served fresh juices.
After checked with the other lady, mixed juice was the fresh one without sugar which made me confused.
Only this, other than that all were perfect.."
"We came to the Rimba resort for our honeymoon and the room was stunning. It was comfortable and had high quality amenities. It even had a rain shower head and a magnifying mirror. Only downside is this resort is far away from other tourist attractions, but is sufficient if you use their many restaurants and facilities.  Sometimes it was difficult to order a Gojek, as the drivers would keep cancelling due to the weather conditions and our location. 
Overall, our experience was wonderful and I will come back with my second wife 😉"
"I came here on October, the weather really nice. Cool breeze even on sunny day. The room is clean with comfy beds. Breakfast menus are all delicious! We can go to kubu beach, it is ayana-rimba's private beach. They provide buggy car to take us to ayana resort or kubu beach. Very beautiful nature view, clean air, feels refreshed after staying here :) Also dont forget to visit their rooftop bar, Unique rooftop bar, where we can enjoy foods and drinks while chilling out in the swimming pool."
It was really great experience and  regret that we only booked here for 1 night. Staff are all very nice and room was very clean and cool. Breakfast was buffet which was great. Swimming pools are very big and nice too! I would like to come back here when I come to Bali again!
"We loved having access to two amazing resorts - RIMBA & Ayana.  The staff were lovely & went out of their way to ensure we had great service. 
The only downside is the price of food and drinks.  A 250ml can of coke is $7 AUD?! And the same cocktails at the pool in Ayana were several dollars cheaper than when we moved to Rock Bar.  Nevertheless we had an amazing time & had read other reviews beforehand sharing the same sentiment around very high food and drink prices."
"Staying at Rimba for 2 nights, enjoying a whole day exploring the area, I love the bathtub and shower! Although I think the hotel needs to maintain the aircon a bit, since the aircon control in my room at that time was error so that we can't really adjust the temperature, but the service was excellent! We called in for service and it was fast response!"
"I had a high expectation, but my whole experience was beyond it. Lovely staff, great great resort. Perfect for couple, family. But may not suitable for disable people, because there's a lot of stairs, up and down hills, needed to use tram a lot to many facilities. There's a lot to do in resort itself, no need to go out. There's plenty choices of restaurant you can go to, and they're currently building their own shopping place (i ask one of the staff, cause i saw a construction going on near front gate). And they have ""Ayana Hotel"" app, that you can use to see the map, order some food and else. Very useful and effective. The room is very clean, has a auto bidet. And the Kubu beach (Ayana private beach) also very clean, I had a full body massage by the beach it's SO GOOD. Definitely will come back again!!!"
"Recently stayed at Rimba with a large group for a girls trip and Rimba not only upgraded us but made our stay so comfortable and easy. Lovely staff and facilities, it is just such an awesome place to stay. I will be back!"
Rimba Hotel is located in a huge complex and guests can enjoy facilities in Ayana Hotel. Shuttle car / tram is provided to commute between the hotels and to go to the beach. Very clean and the room is spacious.
"The view was majestic from the lift to the Kubu Beach was majestic , same goes to the Rock Bar during sunset . So much things to do since the hotel area is huge.
The staffs is super friendly.
The price is affordable.
The only cons is not babies friendly as you cant bring stroller to every level , a lot of stairs.
Other than that RECOMMENDED ⭐️"
My family and I stayed at RIMBA for 3 nights. It was awesome as we could easily travel around the whole AYANA resort to enjoy the full suite of facilities! There are 12 different pools and my toddler is spoilt for choice! The scenery at Kubu beach is breathtaking! The staff is also friendly and always prompt in responding to our requests. Would definitely come here again when I visit Bali.
Love how big the hotel is and that we are able to use facilities across all. The tram comes every 10 minutes so it’s super convenient. All the pools were fantastic and staff were friendly. RIMBA is newer and definitely well maintained. Love how it has all in one - forest views and ocean / cliff views.
"I highly recommend if you are travelling with family best place to stay they have many facilities inside the Ayana itself that you can access even if you stay at Rimba Jimbaran. Plus the rooms are always clean, staff are super helpful and friendly. I would go back to the place in a heartbeat."
"Good stay and value for money 
Everything’s is good here 
Breakfirst is great many choices 
Room is clean staff very friendly 
Love everything’s here 
Hopefully can come back again 
Thank you Rimba 
We really happy with it 🥰"
Phenomenal property. This place is magical and everything was excellent from the moment of arrival til departure. The customer service and attention to detail is top notch. I am looking forward to returning here again. Food options are endless and so convenient. Superb experience all around.
Beautiful views. Can give 5 star for the cleanliness. Beautiful location. Good choice for couples.
"Thanks for the romantic room decoration for my anniversary. We had a wonderful time during our stay, friendly staff always in smiling face make us very comfortable. Food, facilities and scenery all in 10/10."
"Great hotel concept, very nice ambience, clean, friendly staff, delicious breakfast dishes. Will stay here again!"
"New resort with top amenities, service and what comes with it. The resort is huge but easy to manouvre with shuttlebusses and helpful staff."
Rimba Ayana offers the best relaxing and peaceful place for all ages. Love the access to all the facilities at Ayana. Staff is super friendly and welcoming. Love this place!
"Spent three days at the Rimba. Our room 4031 was modern, spacious and very clean. All the staff are very polite and a credit to the hotel. The only gripe I would have is regarding the price of drinks which compared to the previous six hotels we have stayed in and around Bali this hotel was far far more expensive."
"We ended our Bali trip with a 2-day stay here, and I must say it was an apt place to wind down after the trip. It's a beautiful property, that gives you access to 12 beautifully landscaped swimming pools, a nice secluded beach, and some amazing food. Good hospitality too. Would definitely go back here on our next trip."
"This hotel was literally one of the best I’ve stayed at in long awhile. Great accommodation, swimming pools, beach, restaurants and staff."
"swimming pool is the best I have ever experinced.
people are very kind and helpful.
if you try a rock bar, 6 pm will be perfect"
"This place is amazing, a big park with more than ten pools! All workers here are good and willing to help you for any kind of problem, and they work positively! Just like Disney park."
A fantastic stay with my family. Kids simply enjoy their stay with many swimming facilities. Awesome private beach and great view of the Jimbaran Bay. Will definitely come back again.
Staff was amazing and the location is very close to everything you need.
overall the facilities and staffs are excellent. I've been there several times and always my fav.
"It’s a great stay at rimba, we are stayed at a family ocean suite room, the room was nice but I didn’t like the smells in the elevator.  The staff were very nice and helpful, they have a huge swimming pools, the facilities are great, the kubu beach are beautiful and they provide shuttle bus to drive us from the hotel to the beach, kids can feed the fish in the morning, they have slide, a huge ground. I will come back again"
"it is a huge resort. you stay in Rimba and get to access to ayana resort as well. Rimba is more jungle like but it has its own vibes. The resort is just beautiful everywhere you see. 
Room service menus were delivered hot and delicious. I loved breakfast and food in many restaurant in the resort. 
Access to pool was easy and enjoyable. Definitely recommend the room type if you are a swim person.
The rates and food and beverage prices are quite expensive compared to Bali standards. 
Yet, if you are dreaming of romantic honeymoon or couple time. This place is definitely the one."
Best hotel to stay and the service is amazing. This is my second time and will stay again. Always something new when i visit
"A wonderful stay with my family of 2 kids. Great swimming facilities and private beach, and awesome view of the Jimbaran Bay. Will definitely come back again."
"Positive:
- the stafss very nice & friendly!!
- facilities! , The pool, restaurants, fitness, etc
- in room dining taste delicious.
Negative:
- the location, kinda secluded but, worry not!, Thanks to gojek, gofood, and there is small entertainment center nearby called Samasta
- breakfast selection, i think you might need to add more 2 to 3 choices, like: beef/ciken sautee (teriyaki/mushroom/black pepper/roasted/etc)"
"Best hotel I've ever stayed in. Staff, cleanliness. Everything was on point during our stay."
"Enjoyed our stay at Rimba thoroughly, everyone was so friendly, truly got the Bali hospitality and warmth. The facilities were superb, especially the pools and bar. Enjoyed the access to Ayana and Kubu beach as well! Definitely will be back!"
"Our room is quite small , not good at all. but the whole place is awesome. Many different kind of swimming pool, restaurants, all facilities are great and staff is very helpful. Will try the better type of room next time!"
"This resort is absolutely massive, and growing! I couldn’t believe it! While the rooms was a little expensive, we got a free upgrade and the resort allowed you to stay the day of check out to continue to use their facilities! It’s a must to check out the Rock Bar and Ocean Pool. We will definitely be back!"
"This was our second time stay at Rimba and would go back. Hotel staff was Outstanding. The service, food and cleanliness were excellent. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you"
"I just wish we had more time there.
We didn’t need to leave, the resort had everything we needed and plenty to do.
The staff were friendly and helpful with all requests. Highly recommended."
"Amazing staff, world-class service. Room amenities and hotel facilities are in superb condition. Free shuttle bus can take you to any place in the resort and you can use all the facilities at Ayana. Private beach (Kubu Beach) is the place you must visit. Highly recommended for any traveller."
I am in awe at my experience.  Top notch service.  The place is huge.  Facilities are immaculately clean. Will definitely return.  The private beach was closed due to high-tide and I missed out.  Rock Bar is a great place for sunset.  The place is beautiful.  Room is very nice.  The bathroom is beautiful with the round tub.  The Ayana Spa is great - will return definitely.
"It's a big hub to live, there are beach, children zone, many infinity pools, gyms,  rocks bar, and monkeys. You can stay here for a whole day  . It's very good for family travel.  There is a shuttle bus in the hub. you can take it to other places in ayana hub. And the breakfast is very various, fresh ground coffee is very good.
These deficiencies are the bed of the forest room is too soft and collapses, not very comfortable."
"Everything from the cleanliness to service is top notch. No other resort in Bali can match Ayana. The other downside is that it was noisy in the room from the morning onwards due to cleaning of the rooms, a noisy family upstairs who are dragging furniture. Walls are a bit thin so you can hear movement and noise at night. But other than this, everything else including rock bar is fantastic!"
"First, i booking Rimba for one night.. But i got massage from Rimba that Rimba must closed then they move me to the Ayana Resort and Spa.. Im really gratefull for that, because i got upgrade room to deluxe ocean room with very nice view.. The room was so big with classic & elegant design and also wonderful amenities.. I really enjoy my one night with a lot of facilities like swimming pool, gym, spa.. And i got 2 free ticket for aquatonic pool... 10 tumbs up for Ayana.. Soon if i go to bali, i’ll stay in Ayana or Rimba again.."
We loved every bit of our stay.. The staff are amazing and go out of their way.. You have access to every pool of every resort within the complex no matter where you're staying. Breakfast was top notch! Cannot wait to return
"Absolutely loved our stay.
Staffs were genuine and provided amazing services.
Stunningly beautiful architecture everywhere you go.
Being able to use facilities across all three Ayana Resorts provided excellent value for money."
"Location is just normal. But its worth coming bk here anytime again.
Breakfast is very nice and got a lot of dining place here that why we can try many foods here. Will come again in the future!"
"I LOVE my stay at Rimba. It’s a stunning resort with countless facilities, you’ll definitely find something for you. 
I would highly recommend. The team is wonderful and to their best to look after you!"
Our second visit to Rimba and always happy staying at Rimba. Have an advantage to enjoy two hotel facilities of Rimba and Ayana.
"Very happy to stay at this hotel, the kids love the beach, the pool, and the staffs so friendly"
"Loved staying here. Probably the best place I have ever stayed. The rooms, the facilities, the staff, the service. All amazing!!!"
"It's really amazing hotel and space 
We really enjoyed and high recommend 
100% use again and again and recommend to all my friends 
Thanks Rimba by ayana staff"
"The staffs were so helpful. They provided advices which made our first day in Bali easier. The driver provide by the hotel was so passionate. He provided good hospitality to us. The shuttle bus services was so good that we could travel to Rock Bar without obstacles.
Definitely recommend this if you would like to travel around in the southern part of Bali."
"We had a short stay at Rimba Ayana in Jimbaran. the facilities are great keep upto date and very clean.
but the main possitive poi t is the staff, they were all supper helpful and very friendly easy to comunicate in English.
would definitely recommend and will be back to stay for a longer period next time."
"Beautiful location and great resort with amazing staff. The resort has numerous attractions - pools, restaurants, bars to choose from. Access to all the Ayana facilities is a bonus."
"Close to Airport, but relaxed. Close to Uluwatu and GWK also."
Great resort for couples or families. Tram facilities to move around the complex.
"Rimba Ayana is a nice hotel, with great facilities, is clean, and all staff is helpful.
Will be back at this hotel again."
"The view on hotel is so beautiful and charming,i"
"As soon as we got there from the staffs at the front desk (I actually had to ask his name: Andra ) He was very welcoming and prompted in taking care of us with warm smile. 
I have traveled many other resorts/hotels including maldives , vietnam, Singapore etc. This resort is very well maintained and oh one more thing , we have tried almost all the restaurants here in Ayana. At Dana restaurant, Widi was also very kind and helping in choosing good menu. He was very professional and taking well care of us. We will come back because of this resort."
Room is clean and new. Good facility and friendly staff.
"Fabulous resort in an ideal location. Secluded beaches and the coolest bars and restaurants. The environment was well prepared with an amazing attention to detail. We met Riki one of the proprietors who treated us to the VIP seats in the amazing Rock bar... A totally enjoyable stay. Would recommend to anyone with family or couples just looking for romantic settings. First class stay. Yoga, a staff member was most helpful and informative and polite. Just a nice guy."
The Location is great and food is good.Amenities is superb. A bit of malfunction of the toilet door. its hard to slide to closed .The rest of the Ayana property is so beautiful especially Ayana .
"Room is very clean and quiet spacious, the hotel is so big, we can also use ayana facilities. Swimming pool is so big. Very recommended for family with kids"
"It has everything,  so many pools and private beach, restaurants and bar where we enjoyed sunset. Also a doctor in the resort who helped my son for food sickness."
The grounds and facilities at the Ayana resort are lovely and varied to suit different preferences. There are so many different pools to choose from and I enjoyed both the beach and jungle sides of the resort. The trams were reliable and quick to get around the resort. The food was good. All in all RIMBA offered great value considering that you can take advantage of the whole property. Very relaxing resort.
"This property is 90 hectare of forest and beach, absolutely stunning.  Breakfast is superb, good quality.  Staff is absolutely the best.  Will come again!"
"You won’t get bored in this hotel. Minimum stay supposed to be 3 days 2 nights. They have a lot of breath taking view and great pool here. Don’t miss out to take a walk here. Breakfast is great, definitely will come back so soon :)"
We really enjoyed our stay.  We had staff stay at Rumba and we stayed at a Villa.   The aquatonics pool is always a great distraction.  Thanks everyone who took such great care and made are much need break special
"You won’t be disappointed if you love swimming and lay around the pools, there are many swimming pools to choose from. The service was fantastic, all the staff are so friendly and accomodating to your needs. The location is a bit secluded because the whole hotel complex is so big. A shuttle tram is provided for guess to visit the other sister hotels and it’s facilities. The breakfast was amazing, plenty of food to choose from, Western, Asian, Indonesian and selection of breads and desserts. I love my stay and I will come back again"
Our third time staying at Rimba and did not disappoint! Highly recommend.
"This place is absolute amazing!! Stunning..          Soo much to do and see! You don’t need to leave and need more than 2 nights to really experience it all. Breakfast was amazing! Staff are amazing! 
Very pricey but happy to pay it with the view and service we got!   Unknowingly to us We had covid on our last night and they help with doctors and what not. Gave us late check out which helped a lot. I’ll be returning asap with the whole family I hope!! Xoxo"
Chill relax mode within the resort itself. Need not set out at all. Expensive but worth it for couple of days
"Im really satisfying stayed in Rimba, they have completed facilities with 7 swimming pool, clean room, outstanding staff, fast internet, nice bath tub.
This is the perfect hotel to bring your family.
But my notes to this hotel are
1. Security in front gate do not polite when we were using motorcycle.. This is some serious note
2. No smart tv
3. Breakfast taste not that good, a lot of hotel out there have a better taste of breakfast."
We enjoyed our stay there. There are so many activities and plans to do within the hotel. The overall place has been well maintained.
"Loved the jungle vibes, rooms, pools, bars, restaurants, you don’t need elsewhere to go once you’re in the hotel. Not to mention super friendly staffs. Definitely will come back. Keep up the good work"
"I enjoyed my stay here. Everything was fantastic. I got a free room upgrade, and the room was amazing. Overall, I’m so happy that I got the chance to stay there."
Its a perfect time to have quality time
I request for a little bit Happy Honeymoon decoration. I got macaroon and some chocolates. Really appreciate about this🙏 The chocolate so delicious too. We enjoy to stay there. Hope I can come next time. Thank you so much for great services to us !!
Rimba and people in Ayana area always give their best service!! They are also super friendly🫶🏽
"The bed was biggger compared to other (with same stars). Love it so much. 
And it's located near a mini market and also Samasta/Movenpick. Hotel's facilities are also great, have private beach, few kids friendly swimming pools too"
"Big welcome when i arrive, they send the luggage before I go to the room.
All the staff very helpful and kind."
"its like 3 resports in one as you can visit and use the other ayana hotels facilites and restaurants. 
Staff is soooooo nice and so loving to my son Harrison. Would highly recommend and return!"
The stay was incredible and the staff were very helpful in terms of handling my queries!! Would love to stay again when i return to Bali
"The resort is exactly like in the pictures, the service and facilities exceeded my expectations. There’s a shuttle every 10 minutes that takes you to each resort within the property. Plenty of food, pool and activity options. Food and beverage definitely not the cheapest but the room and facilities were so worth it. Highly recommended!"
"my parents in law stayed there, and couldnt boast it more. they had a lovely stay. great breakfast, staff, and the room dont even mention it. too good to be true :)"
Stayed here for 3 nights. Everything was just perfect. Good housekeeping. Amazing scenery from my room. Bed and pillows were so comfortable. Love the pools. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
"We had wonderful  time there.  If you have children, your children will definitely love this place."
