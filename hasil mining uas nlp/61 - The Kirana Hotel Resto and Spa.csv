"Overall the main facilities could use some refreshing, but the beds and sheets are very good quality and very comfortable. There air conditioning works well and the room felt clean and comfortable."
"I love this hotel, it in such a great location - walking distance from the beach, markets, spas, and many many restaurants and cafes. The rooms are so clean and comfy I loved chilling in there and the beds are so comfortable you literally melt into the pillow and duvets. The staff are sosososo kind and friendly. I would definitely stay here again."
"While the common areas of the hotel are a bit run down, the staff are super polite, knowledgeable and friendly, and the bed and sheets are new and comfortable as are the towels. The air conditioning worked well and we had room cleaning daily"
"We booked pool access room
As seen in photo, the one next to the pool. very satisfying place.  
Very near to beach like 1 km and very near to vegan restaurants like 650m and 1km.... 
=> Breakfast: The hotel is very good because they can arrange vegan breakfast and hence value for money.
=> Spa - has a good option. and also many good packages
Lovely
We had coffee with soyamilk
cornflakes with soyamilk
and juices most of times 
in the included breakfast
In september 2022 - hotel seems to have recovered from the pandemic too, rest of bali is also in process"
"The Kirana is AWESOME!
Perfect location, just a 7-minute walk to an amazing beach with epic sunsets and best longboard wave in Bali. Perfect for learning to surf. The street has lots of excellent restaurants serving delicious, healthy, beautiful food. The Kirana staff is so nice, helpful and accommodating in every way.  Thank you staff you made my trip wonderful!"
"Great place, everything worked really well. Good location, close to restaurants, bars and a 5 minute walk the beach. The shared pool is 
 nice. Would stay again."
"Decided to spend a night here but turned out I like this hotel and extended my stay. I got the room with pool access and I think this is the best room if you travel alone. The staffs are friendly and the location is just perfect- walk to beach, cafes, minimarkets... I'll stay again on my next trip. Best price also from Agoda."
"Good hotel in Canggu, the staff was so nice. The room is clean and spacious. 
Only 10 mins walk to the beach and surrounded with so many good place to have a dinner/ breakfast while in Canggu."
"I stayed 8 days here and highly recommend it. The staffs are so friendly and the location is walking distance to Old Man’s, Luigi’s, Sand Bar, Cocomo (favorite restaurant) and more."
"Staffs are super nice. The location also close to the beach, you can go surfing anytime without traffic. Decent restaurants are also near by, every place are walking distance."
"Just had a great 3 night stay at the Kirana Canguu , I found the room and bed very comfortable and all the staff excellent in helpfulness and friendly . There are plenty of food options outside the hotel for lunch and dinner with a great convienant location .The hotel breakfast was filling , loved the pancakes !! The pool was excellent size with a nice outlook . Cant wait to stay again next visit !!"
"The location was great! Staff were amazing - so friendly and helpful. We got massages while we were there - and the spa was lovely, and massage was incredible! The pool was nice ( much colder than we expected!) but perfect for the heat of the day. It does get shaded over pretty early in the day, so make sure you take advantage of it in the morning! The rooms were clean, comfortable, and well appointed with everything you needed - mini fridge, kettle and coffee & tea, safe, large closets, ample lighting, and universal plug outlets. There didnt seem to be anything on TV, but thats ok - I'd rather be watching sunset, or people watching anyway. 
While the rooms were great, the common areas of the property seemed to be very run down and mostly out of order. There are a lot of photos in this listing of Rooftop bars, Spa with t a view, the gym, and the Penthouse suite... we went up to the top floor looking for the rooftop from the pictures ( the elevator was out of order too) and all we found was a very run down area on the roof that had so much potential to be a cool hangout spot, but had become very derelict. The corridors on the upper levels seemed to be experiencing some flooding, and it didnt seem like the Spa upstairs or the Penthouse was operational. We also tried to find the ""Gardens"" from the photos, but i don't think they exist anymore. There is a beautiful view of a lush jungle marsh from the pool, and the second floor rooms. It does feel like a little oasis in the middle of chaotic Canggu."
"I stayed at The Kirana for a month and really enjoyed my stay. The rooms are clean and new, the bed and pillows super comfortable and the pool always inviting for a swim. Staff were amazing, very friendly and helpful. Special shout outs to Dewa and Irma who always cared about me and became my friends.  There are some maintenance issues left over from Covid but they are getting on top of these and they didn’t detract from my stay. Location is 10/10 also close to everything."
The staff are amazing. Location is excellent. I was comfortable here and would return. Good value for money.
"Great location, penthouse was great with own pool. Massage was probably the best we had in Bali."
"The staff here are amazing. My only complaint was that the internet speeds were inconsistent, and occasionally dropped out. So if you're a remote worker, you might want to take that into consideration.
Water pressure was also low and hot water was rare. But that was fine because I didn't mind taking cold showers after a long day in the Bali heat.
Their mie goreng and nasi goreng for breakfast was a real treat.
During my stay, the gym area was out of service which led me to join a gym nearby."
"Good, thanks"
"The rooms have a good size and looks overall quite nice. A little balcony to sit and tan that can fit 1-2 people.  Good selection of TV channels, nice pool, and a pretty good view from the 2nd floor and up.  The staff was very nice and helpful, and fixed a problem with the room very quickly when reported. 
Overall good value for what I payed.
The biggest drawback is that the WiFi in the rooms are incredibly slow, but a little faster in the reception. It's so slow that it often doesn't register that you're connected to the internet. The WiFi in general is Canggu isn't fast, so I don't expect to be streaming, but compared to any restaurant it's super slow."
"Special mention to Front Office and F & B staff. Especially Ms Irma. She is very helpful & cheerful towards guest. She checked myself in a efficient manner. I stayed for 4D3N. Every morning Ms Irma served a very delicious American breakfast in fine dinning style. Property is nearby plenty of Restaurants, Cafe, Spa, Laundry, Shops. Best feature of Kirana Hotel is just 7 minutes walk to Batu Bolong beach. Here you can chill out at numerous bars & cafes while watching a glorious sunset. The Kirana Hotel is highly recommend."
"This hotel has a nice staff, clean rooms and is convenient to the water (5min walk).  It isn't a large property, but what do you expect in busy canggu?  you can do way worse..perfect for someone who doesn't want/need a large resort but also doesn't want to be in a hostel.  In the USA, an equivalent hotel type could be a newer Holiday Inn Express."
"The location of this hotel is really its selling point its bout 5-7 mins walk from Batu Bolong beach and in the middle of some lovely shops, bars and restaurants. The Front of house and restaurant areas are beautifully presented. Breakfast was lovely. The Spa at the hotel was great and brilliantly priced. The pool setup isn't ideal as loungers are placed directly outside peoples rooms. The room was clean with a large comfortable bed but it was a bit dated in comparison to some on the other hotels (including those at a lower star rating) we stayed at throughout our trip. 
Super helpful staff. Kirana is a great base for exploring Canggu."
Low water pressure was the only major issue
Super close to the beach. It’s a shame new bungalows are being built and block the ocean view now. But the staff can’t be beat. A very nice breakfast. Nori gives the best message.
The elevator button on the ground floor was broken the entire time I was there (4 nights) - not the elevator just the buttons to call it!
"if you need a hotel just to crash and explore the city, this could be it.  location is great but amenities are not.  Staff provide good service too.."
"The place is stunning, so is the pool area. Is defiantly worth the money."
"Been staying at Kirana for almost 8yrs whenever we go Canggu, the hotel is close to the beach and lots of restaurants n shops too. 
Maybe due to the pandemics, or shortage of staff, the cleanliness is a bit disappointing.
Nevertheless it's still a good hotel to stay as is very convenient."
"They have basic facilities:
-Spa massage room for 2
-Simple breakfast, no kitchen services for lunch or dinner
-Exercise room but did not enter/use
-Rooms are decent, WiFi available
-Toilet will need some work done - remove mold from silicon seals and calcium deposits from shower head
7-minutes walking distance from the beach. Close to shops, bars, and restaurants. Quiet environment."
"everything you need is close by: beach, nice restaurants and shopping possibilities. Staff was very helpful and kind. Facilites a bit outdated and the pool area was not too comfortable."
"Great location as hotel is close to the beach, cafe, restaurants and bars.
Beds are comfortable to sleep in with the pillows and duvets. Daily housekeeping helps keep the room clean. 
Only let down is the shower, drainage is poor and the water pressure is low. I really missed a good shower. 
Din try the breakfast here, so, I can’t review. However, that said, plenty of foods to eat around."
"Everything was perfect, except bathroom can use a little work on cleanliness. Toilet was squeaking, it was annoying but other than that great stay. I would recommend"
"Affordable price, delicious breakfast, and clean room"
"Good value for money, nothing extraordinary but nice"
I love the bed very spacious. amazing location.
Nice but rooms are a little small
"Really enjoyed my stay. Great food / staff so helpful, though I would say I had great difficulty connecting to the WiFi."
"Although it’s my second time at Kirana, I understand that during the pandemic, the hotel really suffered a great deal, and it shows in its exterior as much as it’s interior and washroom facilities. 
The location still remains the best thing about this hotel and so does the comfort of the bed, what was a huge disadvantage to them was the lack of amenities, facilities and adequate cleanliness of the rooms. 
It was at its peak in 2017, and I’m confident that with time it’ll get back to its former glory."
Very quiet hotel and the light was very dim in the first-floor room. The shower floor was dirty so I always put on my slipper. The shower door could not fully open and the door handle was very dirty. The room was clean although because of the dim light I felt it was dusty. The exterior felt like it was an abandoned building since the resto (?) outside was closed. The staffs were nice though.
"Super friendly and helpful staff.  But the first room we got on the 2nd floor was very moist and smelt from moist. The second room was overall okay, but just like in the first room the rain-shower/shower-head-system was broken and I gave up trying to get it fixed/replaced after the third attempt.  When taking a closer look at the other installations (e. g.  breaking down wooden balcony/disfunctional elevator) it seems that the hotel is lacking financial means."
"Cheap hotel that needs some work. Aircon weak, shower weak most facilities not really working. Staff were good and helpful location was good but wasn’t an overly comfortable experience"
"Great Location, staff was friendly, although i think they showers needs to be fixed as the water barely came out of the shower heads."
"The room is old with little pressure when shower, room is damp, moist."
"When we first checked in, we were disappointed by the cleanliness of the hotel. The bedsheets were full of stains. When we asked them to change them, they struggled to find clean ones. Eventually we settled for the cleanest one.
The building has strong signs of not being used during the Covid-19 pandemic and needs a general makeover. The hotel is somewhat falling apart. You can find humidity damage everywhere, and the wood on our balcony was completely rotten. The water pressure was low for most of our stay, and for one night we did not get hot water.  
The service and the  breakfast were good. The staff was apologetic for our inconveniences and tried to mitigate.
The stay overall would have been ok if we started with lower expectations. The hotel does not deserve 4 stars in my opinion."
"Had clothes stolen from room, i wouldn’t recommend."
"No business centre, No gym, No Kids Room & Kids Pool...
My room aircond was so warm.. 
Room & bathroom not well clean, U can see few strand of hairs and dirt on the floor & in the bathtub!
Complimentary 2 Mineral water bottle so small compared to other hotels in Bali!
Breakfast selection is fixed though quite good.
I Would Advise Other Travelers With Children To Look Else Where...Ok For Solo or Couple Traveler With Fuss!"
The pool is unusable with cloudy green water. Damp and smelly bathroom with lots of small flies and clogged sink. Staff is nice but the place really need a refresh. Won't be back.
"I can't complain about the location or staff. However the hotel has seen better days. First room given to me had faulty front door, no wifi reception, poor water pressure and no working TV. The elevator was also out of order during my 3 night stay. The replacement room had intermittent wifi, Low water pressure and also no tv reception during my stay."
"It’s an adequate hotel but not very clean. Lots of soap scum on the shower door. The pillows were old and the mattress not super comfortable.
The breakfast was really good and the staff were nice."
"Great staff & location but could not make up for general property neglect  ie non-functioning lifts, low shower pressure, water damaged floors & poor wifi.  Perhaps an aftermath from a long Covid shut down."
Old room. Everything but the bed looked old and not like the pictures. There’s cheaper hotels around the area which are better than this. Sorry.
"Room does not look like the photos posted in Agoda. Bathroom flooded after 3 minutes of showering. Got bitten by bed bugs the next morning. 
Only plus point is the location, close to cafes and eateries."
"Thankfully we only stayed two nights. Here’s a few problems. Damp flaking plaster in our room, mould in the shower, water ok for shower however not hot enough for a bath, TV had no international channels due to “ we have only been open for two months after Covid,” which of course gave ample time to rectify the other issues. As with all issues in business it’s not the fault of the staff but poor management."
The hotel doesn’t look like the pictures. The overall impression is it’s very worn out and doesn’t feel fresh. The hotel is not worth the money.
Wifi is non existent
"Good service, near beach n bar"
Though the staff were
"This is my first ever solo experience yet to Bali! Having heard so much about Bali and had to google  an accommodation that suits for everything including safe travels and security, I chose Kirana for the location along one of the most accessible and busiest roads in Canggu- the street wakes up after 8am! One of my most pleasant stay I’ve ever had having as my ultimate retreat. It was also my first ever lifetime experience of Balinese Massage and Foot Massage yet at Kayana Spa, Kirana Hotel- WOW I’ve got to say I truly enjoyed inclusive the friendly hospitality & customer service! This is the retreat place to be, affordable price! (Ie. 30 mins foot massage for IDR 90 000 yet in luxe place whatcha say!) On another note, if you know how to ride a scooter it’s a bonus as only local taxis are allowed in this area. So plan your daytrip well and wisely!"
"We came to Bali for the first time and stayed at the Kirana for 4 days. 
The hotel lives up to all expectations and we can recommend this place fully.
The beach is in walking distance. Also there are some great lunch/dinner places just around the corner (i.e. betlenut cafe).
However, the food at the Kirana can be fully recommended as well.
Not located in the center of the buzz of Kuta or Seminyak, the hotel is quiet and still close to the surfer hotspot of Canggu beach and Echo beach. To Seminyak there are free hotel shuttles or you can rent a motorbike and drive there (ca. 20min drive).
We can fully recommend this place."
"I had a very pleasant time in the Kirana hotel. First the location is very central at the batu belong street that makes it very easy to travel everywhere in the Canggu area. The rooms were cleaned everyday and had everything to offer (pool area rooms are good, where you directly can walk in for a morning swim session!). The breakfast is standard included were you get different options to choose (from american breakfast to indonesion food!). Service is great! they were very helpful in arranging stuff from renting a bike to order a cab. The last they I had a check out around 12, and they arranged for me the possibility to shower just before my late flight which was really good service for me!! Thanks Kirana, and maybe back soon!"
"My 2 week stay at The Kirana Hotel was a a pleasurable experience. I stayed in the Ocean View Deluxe Room on the 3rd floor. I had a good size room with a large modern bathroom, huge flat screen TV & a very comfortable bed overloaded with pillows. I had sweeping ocean views from my balcony but the downside was my room became hot in the afternoon due to the sun setting & shining straight into my room. You just have to close the curtains to keep the room cool. The only complaint i had about my room was the WiFi was a bit hit & miss on my floor & there was an odour from the water when you first turn the shower on, these are minor things. I found the house keeping, room service & laundry to be affordable & very prompt. All staff members were very welcoming, accommodating & helpful towards any requests when asked upon & always greeting my friends & I with a smile & a wave everyday. One thing I must point out is the dining in the restuarant is of 5 STAR quality. My friends & I dined there on a few occasions & the steaks & fish mains are to die for !!! hats of to the chef !!! the brecky menu to is of high standards but make sure you try the whole brecky menu for there are some hidden delights waiting to be sampled. All in All I enjoyed my stay at the Kirana Hotel & would come back again in the future. Travellers Tip : poolside rooms can be noisy from the swimmers, music from the restaurant & the gym above the rooms."
"The Kirana is in a prime location for seeing all of Canggu easily. Rooms are fine - tidy, good beds, cable TV, daily cleaned, cheap minibar. The highlight for our (large) family was breakfast and the staff - all were perfect and huge serves! Not a buffet but it’s plenty for all ages. The pool is OK, a bit too small for kids to really enjoy 😉. All in all, a perfect little place for a cheap stay in Canggu for a family. We also loved that it was so quiet being set off the main road Batu Bolong. Thanks Kirana"
"It was a beautiful stay at the Kirana. Right from when we got down from our taxi, we fell in love with the place. And what a welcome! Beautiful, well kept rooms greeted us. Nice cosy restaurant. Not too many dishes on the menu though but the food was good and tasty. The best part was the accessibilty to the canggu beach. The pool was nice and clean.Special kudos to the very warm staff , right from the reception to the restaurant to the room service who smiled and greeted us all the time and gave impeccable service. Lovely food joints around the place as well. If one wants to just relax and enjoy the ocean , Kirana is the place to stay for sure..."
"Nice place to stay. We enjoyed the other pool and beach areas around Canggu more than the pool at the hotel. But the breakfast was a great jump start to each day, and the rooms were comfortable. I was expecting a little nicer for the price, but Canggu doesn't have many nice hotels so close to the beaches and in the center of town like Kirana is. It is a great location close to everything and its easy to rent a bike and go elsewhere as well. Would definitely recommend."
"We stayed at The Kirana recently in the penthouse suite with our 9 month old baby and it was just perfect. We could relax knowing he could crawl around and not hurt himself. The private pool was great for when he was having naps and we needed to be close by. 
Staff were really friendly and helped with any washing of bottles and heating food. They were also really quick to respond to emails during booking process too. 
We walked to old man's which was super close and to the practice for yoga. We could walk to echo beach but a touch too far - would ride a bike or take a car if with small children/babies. 
Great value for money, I think this hotel also has some good food and we saw the Balinese dance on a Wednesday night and a young expat couple were in there on a date night who live in Canggu, so a good sign that it's not just tourists. A lot of hotels/villas are going up in the area and looks like maybe in front of the penthouse view :( But I would still come back as it suited our needs. 
Only drawback for us was the high chair wasn't suitable for our baby, as no buckle/belt so he could slip through. Someone always came and held him during mealtimes so that helped though 😉"
"The location, the staff, the breakfast, everything was perfect. The hospitality and service of the staff was the best part of the hotel overall. The room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. It was a 5 min walk to the beach and all the cafes/restaurants. They also give you free 15 min foot massage at the hotel spa which was amazing! Nothing negative to say! We intend to come back to Canggu and we will definitely stay at the Kirana again :)"
"Here for a wedding so looked for accomodation near to Seseh. Although we didn't know Canggu, we were really glad to have found Hotel kirana and the area we stayed in. It is realitively quiet but has some excellent restaurants and coffee shops down the road. You can walk to the beach in 5mins, it's quite a surfers hangout, crashing waves, black sand etc. It was so easy to get a taxi anywhere, the reception helped with all our needs, getting to the wedding, a trip to Seminyak and onward travel to Pemuteran. The hotel looked to have a lovely spa centre and so we were disappointed we ran out of time to book in. Breakfast was quite good but we didn't eat here at night, preferring to go to Betelnut down the road which was fantastic. Internet and TV reception isn't very good in the rooms ( if you need them) but good in the main lobby. More than happy to come back, although I would be more savy about booking as I thought I had a good deal at $100 only for it to reduce to $50 the week after for the same room."
"I had been staying in a cheap hostel for my week in Canggu but it was pretty shabby so I booked a night at the Kirana for my last night to enjoy a nice shower and bed and AC. With the taxes and fees it ended up being a bit more expensive than I had expected at time of booking, but I was still very glad I stayed there. The facilities were very nice and the included breakfast was huge. My AC unit did drip all night onto a shirt that was on the floor so that was an unfortunate surprise in the morning. Also the way the shower is set up, you get water ALL over the floor of the bathroom and it's way too much to clean up so you're pretty much just walking in standing water and tracking it into your room with you. Besides that, everything was great."
"my husband and I stayed for two nights - mainly to attend a friends wedding at Tugu hotel just down the road. 
I must say for our first time in bali, the balinese are very hospitable people the hotel staff were well mannered, and polite, always smiling and helping you to the best of their abilities. 
the hotel even though been maybe 8-9 months old was nice.. the pool area, restaurant area very inviting, the room was a bit small but okay. air con worked well you really needed it cos it was so hot outside, just a few minor things were that the workmanship in the bathroom wasnt that great, scuff marks on the walls, plastering marks in the tile joints etc, but apart from that it was good. shower was good powerful and heaps of hot water. 
they also provided two free bottles of water and upon arrival gave a welcome drink which was i think pineapple juice. 
Breakfast was a choice of american, kirana special or indonesian. tried the kirana special on the first day which was edible, the second day had the indo one it was much nicer  , portion was really tiny but i guess cant complain since it was included in the hotel price. 
its very near to the beach maybe 3-5 min walk and a few shops up the road, french patisserie and some other small cafes. 
Free wifi in the room and lobby, connection varied, but overall was good and usable.
Free use of bicycles as well and free drop off to Seminyak square even though we did not go. 
all in all, was a pleasant experience , the staff were ever so inviting. !"
"Beds were very comfortable, rooms very nice with robes, flip flops, safe, kettle and fridge. Bathroom  had bath and separate shower and toiletries. Hair dryer can be delivered by reception. We had pool access room which means the pool is 2.5m from the door of our room. We could sit on a sun longer by the door and be at the pool. There were only 5 sun loungers for 6 rooms and all other guests. 2 mornings we were awoken  at 6.30am by local children having loud fun in the pool, which I imagine would have been heard by all rooms as they all face the small pool. Pool is an infinity pool, 8m long.
A small glas walled gym with a sea view has a few machines and weights. Breakfast is 3 choices. - American breakfast of eggs etc, juice and fruit, tea or coffe. Indonesian breakfast of noodles, fruit, juice, tea or coffe. Kirana special of fruit, juice, tea or coffee and eggs Benedict and separate plate of banana pancake. We always had variations and that was no problem. Staff were very helpful and nice. It is a new hotel so staff are sometimes just learning but still great. Got a free foot massage on arrival too. The spa is tucked away on top floor and staff are nice but I couldn't find a spa menu anywhere. Free bicycles too. Great surf beach nearby, not so great for sun loungers. Bit of rubbish on dark sand beach. We loved this hotel."
"Been there only for 1 night,want to escape crowd of the city and YES Kirana made my day.Quite location far from hustle and bustle of the town but not feel like you were lost in the middle of nowhere.The staff always more than happy to let you know where the best place to visit around the hotel.Exotic Batubolong beach is just 5 minutes from the hotel.The room is so simple but superb,clean,and nothing more you could expect.The food was brilliant from the breakfast till dinner,you don't need to go anywhere else to spoilt your tummy.last but not least I already missed my Kirana room,for sure will comeback oneday and bring my family and friends..thank you Kirana...SUPERB!!!"
"It won't be long before this new hotel gets popular, we were so lucky to stay here while it is just new & not many people staying we had the place to ourselves most of the time.  The suite room is fantastic value for money. The staff are caring. It is a short walk to the surf beach & the hip Old Mans bar & restaurant and Kakilima by the Sea, Betelnut organic restaurant and a 5 minute drive to the famous Echo Beach. Very relaxing part of Bali we had a great time & the staff were fantastic with our small children. Thank you Kirana :)"
"I had a very enjoyable time with kirana. Yes it’s a small hotel, may seems smaller than the picture, but the staff here are lovely and helpful. Also it does not accommodate many customer since it’s a small property, it definitely matches your “quiet and relax vacation goal”, no load music, no yelling at night even though it is lactated very close to the beach. If you like to experience party atmosphere, there more bars and restaurant open until late night, just in walking distance. The spa in the hotel is very good, the price is actually cheaper than some of the spa center outside with proper service. Upon check-in, I was offered voucher for free dinner and massage, this is amazing! Since the breakfast is already included, I ended up not spending much money during the stay."
Kirana Hotel staff were a pleasure to assist and I was impressed throughout the stay. The hotel is conveniently situated to Canggu beach and the key hot spots. Pool was great and food was satisfactory. Maybe request a little less cheese on the pizza but that's me ;)
"I've enjoyed my stay at The Kirana. Its a small, new and modern hotel in Canggu about 5 min walk away from the Batu Bolong beach. Stayed in one of the suits which had plenty of room with a separate lounge area. Breakfast is la cart and was good. Front reception team was very helpful with organising trips, taxis etc. Nice coffee shops and restaurant down the road (French patisserie is great). The hotel offers a free shuttle to Seminyak in the morning. It takes 20-30min to get to and from Seminyak depending on traffic. The hotel offers free bike hire which is great to explore the surroundings. For a relaxing stay in Bali The Kirana was a good choice."
"This is my 1st time in Bali , kirana staff is friendly lovely . There's a cafe which near the hotel name old man we love this placed. If your was the surfing person opposite of old man cafe is the sea and nice view 😍 we planing to coming back the year end of early of next year 😘😘"
"I chose this hotel because of the close proximity to Canggu beach and from the good reviews.
It measured up to my expectations, only 500 meters walk from Canggu beach and just as close to some top quality restaurants. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were very comfortable. When I booked an extra night on Agoda the room wasn't available so I was upgraded to a pool suite at no extra charge.
Food was good but try the local restaurants such as Betelnut or Roti Canai, as they were my favourite.
They area has a relaxed atmosphere and is away from the noisy nightlife of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak.
Definitely worth visiting again."
"It’s a 2 star hotel, broken doors, old hotel. Poor breakfast when compared to other hotels. Misleading people."
"Excellent location, clean rooms and great staff."
You can get food easily anytime… a lot of resto surrounding
"Great place to stay. Altho a bit old, service was good and the location was perfect"
The building requires repair and regular maintenance.
"princesses 1,2,and 3 front reception were great! Top spot! close to all!"
"I stayed here for 1.5 weeks and it was amazing! I recommend the deluxe suite! Great views. The pool rooms don’t have much privacy so keep that in mind. Very clean, kind people who work there, and amazing location!!! Close to restaurants, beach, and so much more in the heart of the best part of Canggu. All walking distance. 10/10."
"I have my great stay for 2 nights. Highly recommend for Carla Spa Batu Bolong, just a 3 minutes walk from this hotel.  Must try the back massage and it gives you a relieve after the treatment. There are a lot cafe and pub nearby. The lawn is at the same street. But the Batu Belong beach is not recommend for first time surfing. First time surfing better go to legian beach."
"Even though it's located in the busy area, my room was very quiet and I loved it. My room was not facing pools, so view was limited.
Staff is very friendly, helpful. I enjoyed staying there:))"
"Our room was clean and modern and had a pleasant view. Very kind staff. We did have some issues with ants in our room which were quickly remedied. I was pleasantly surprised that they had a filtered shower head, but unfortunately that shower head felt like pins and needles and the drain couldn't keep up with the water output, so I had to keep turning the shower off every two minutes to prevent the whole bathroom from flooding."
"Right in the ❤️ of Canggu’s hottest street, and yet a total hideaway from the noise and traffic! Loved this place and will definitely stay again when back in Bali!"
"Amazing hospitality and really convenient, in the middle of canggu."
"Nice place, very central and very childfriendly. Babycot available and baby option for breakfast which i really enjoyed. Great beds! Big and tall and comfy. The service is worth all the stars, the hotel could do with an upgrade. The spa is amazing and overall it was a positive experience."
The hotel is in a great location. However its a bit dated. The shower and bathtub was not working properly but the staff fixed it promptly. Breakfast & Food options are limited but lots of cafes in walkable distance. Beach is a 5 minute stroll too .Would recommend   for budget conscious travellers
"Can’t beat the location right on Batu Bolong. Staff is amazing, always friendly and ready to help. We stayed in the penthouse suite which was perfect for us as we needed the space with small children.
*however we didn’t allow kids on the private deck and pool as it doesn’t have a high enough railing or barrier so it’s extremely  dangerous. We kept the door locked that opened to the pool."
"The best staff is here. I was sick and they took care of me… and when earthquake happened, they hugged me… Suksuma 🙏🏼"
Loved this hotel. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Pool is lovely and my room although only partial sea view was big and comfortable.  I will stay again.
Value for money and staff was very friendly
Yes
The warung food is superb. Just beside of the hotel “varuna”.
"stay in this hotel for 2 nights, the staff was great, greetings and describe the facility in details. Great location near Pantai Batu Bolong, easy to find food also."
"Loved this private and not too huge boutique hotel. I got really tired of huge hotels and noisy guests so this place was really nice.
👍"
"First night my room was dirty and you fell everything is too old. 
Second night i change for a clean room but still the hotel became too old."
The location on this hotel was amazing! Everything is walking distance and all the popular spots were there in the tip of fingers. The price is great.
WIFi was horrible! Even restaurants had better WIFi. House cleaning was not attentive and subpar.
"I'll definitely book this hotel again on my next trip to Canggu. The location is great and the room is really clean and huge with adequate space for 3 pax. The only downside is the rain shower head that wasn't working and there were visible water stain on it.
Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast options were fantastic as well.
Will recommend others to stay here :)"
Room was so dirty and old. Please avoid!!!!!
"Excellent breakfast, nice pool. Only complaint is the Wifi not great though. But that’s par for the course for Bali.  Overall highly recommend it."
Checked in only for a day as our flight was late at night . Had a nice pool & the room was great . Free 15 minute foot massage was a nice added bonus. Next to a lot of shopping and restaurants. Room was modern and overlooked the pool . Food was delicious from the on site restaurant.
"Asked to clean my room 2 (!) times (in the morning and in the afternoon) since it was not cleaned, but at the end of the day it was still not cleaned. Terrible service."
"The hotel located in good location. I stayed in room 105(Kirana Suite). 
Breakfast set menu was very delicious. You may ask for special request for toddler meal which my child loves it.  
My room was quite spacious, cozy and serene. Good for family of 3 or 4.
What really disappointed me was the gym, which was lacking the most.
The hotel mgmt need to improve on:
1) Room cleanliness e.g. floor, bathrom.
2) Room lighting e.g many LED light bulbs blown.  
3) Bathroom e.g install a spray bidet, overhead shower not working, lack of power socket for hairdryer. 
4) Safety box keep failing.
5) Extra hangers and ironing facility would be better."
"I have booked this hotel by reading teh good reviews. But when I got here, I was really disappointed. The hotel is old and dark, worn out and shady. We booked for 4 nights here and I couldn’t even stay one night . I left the hotel immediately after checked in. The swimming pool was so small and ugly, they badly need the refurbishment !!"
"The toilet bowl isn’t functioning well. Had to call the house keeping and they fixed it. However, the toilet was dirty upon fixing it and i had to call house keeping again for them to clean the toilet. Toilet was abit dirty. Feedback: to clean the moulds inside the toilet with whitening gel/cleaner. 
Location wise : excellent!"
Totally good for us.
"This hotel is great. We came with our six month old daughter and loved it. Staff were very friendly, great location. We got a suite room and it was massive. 
Only minor negative things; there was no room service menu or laundry booking form in the room, we had to ring and request them. Pool was also quite cold - ok for me but too cold for our young daughter to splash in.
Hotel was quite quiet but I liked that; all the staff knew our name and the breakfast was delicious. Would definitely consider staying here again.
It's right on the main strip in walking distance to the beach and some great bars and restaurants!"
"just 6 or 7 minutes to beach by foot, a lot of restaurants near hotel, super kind staff, clean and cozy room and swimming pool, nice breakfast.
nothing to blame"
"It's good location to the beach and any restaurants. Also swimming pool is very clean. It's in main road but not crowded and noisy. All the staffs are nice and kind
 I love here."
Lovely staff.  Great location.  Beds super comfy and clean linen. Bathroom a bit tired. Pool area lacks shade.  Would stay again.
"A well maintained property.Everything  worked in room.Staff where very friendly  and helpful.Good wifi.
Breakfast was fruit yogurt,eggs and bacon tomato nicely presented and a cup of coffee or tea.Position is 5-10 minutes to beach and  walking away from beach shops and plenty of eating places."
"The kirana hotel is in a great location, very close to the beach and all the shops. We stayed for a night and had a good experience. Nothing great, nothing bad to say, overall good value for money. If you were staying more than a couple of nights I would recommend staying at a villa type of accommodation as this is a hotel so not as great to fully relax."
"I loved everything about this place! The service was incredible, the place super modern and quiet. All the rooms have a cute balcony and a view of the pool. A welcome drink is also included. The place is located a few blocks from the beach and many great restaurants all around the area. I highly recommend!!!!"
"I think the hotel was a little overpriced, but that might be the case for all hotels in Canggu."
"Upsides: Location is superb. Right on Batu Balong with all the shops and restaurants and only a 5-10 min walk from the beach. Staff were super friendly as well. Nice complimentary 15 min massage when you arrive and 20% off first order at the restaurant. 
Downsides: Housekeeping was really poor. They would not tidy anything up and several times when I came back into the room I found someone else's hair on the floor...pretty gross. They also would forget to remove empty water bottles, used cups, not replace water, etc. The food was also below average and flavourless. I'm pretty bummed that I opted for the breakfast because I was so disappointed even though they had so many options. The fruit was always a bit dry and not fresh. The tea was not steeped enough and would get cold by the time breakfast came because they took such a long time to prepare the food. I would have been much more satisfied having breakfast for the same price at many other delicious restaurants."
"Air conditioning system was broken in the first room we were placed in. We had to move a couple of times during our four nights stay which was a hassle. Floors were very dirty. Other than that, good location and quiet surroundings."
