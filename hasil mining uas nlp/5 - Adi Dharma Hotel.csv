"We visited in November and thought the staff and hotel were great. There's no airs and graces which is perfect to just kick back and relax with your child. No fear of upsetting anyone.
We returned after a Europe trip for a couple of nights and were greeted like old family members. Hugs for our son, breakfast orders remembered, asking about our trip since we saw them last.
A beautiful group of people."
"We arrived at 11pm, staff were waiting for us, took our bags up, and from there I knew, yep this going to be a 10/10 experience. 
Breakfast fantastic, the rooms were clean and always kept clean everyday with room service.
The hotel gardens are very balinese which makes it special, the pool with swim up bar, is fantastic.  10/10 from me for Adi Dharma, we loved it."
We spent 7 nights here over New Years. Can't fault anything really. Special mention to the poolside barman juni suwanayasa  who served us with a constant smile and made our time there awesome. The location is great and a quiet oasis in the hustle and bustle of kuta. We would definitely stay again.
"The hotel is great, comfortable and quiet. Spacious room and bed were comfy, best location. The Manager Hotel and all the staff are gorgeous. Thank you. We would recommend this hotel."
"Stay June 2022
Quiet location, easy walk to beachfront, Beachwalk shopping centre (has supermarket downstairs for all your needs). Simple but nice breakfast, pool area clean and quiet during our stay.
Room and bed were comfy, staff were nice, excellent price approx $40AUD per night."
"Oh my goodness!.. I could not have asked for a better location for my first trip..  the hotel is just beautiful,  well maintained, clean, very affordable.. the staff are awesome, friendly and polite.. will definitely be back..x"
"Adi Dharma always deliver. This is our 5th time of staying at this hotel and we always had a great stay. It was quite evident that they are still recovering from the pandemic, and they had to cut back on some of their amenities. However the staff and their service make up for the gap. They were willing to go out of their way to provide the best service for us.  We will definitely come back."
"The staff were so friendly, the surroundings were great, I would highly recommend this as it is near to everything"
"Staff is very friendly. Food is great, pool is great, massage services are great. Internet could be better."
"The environment was great,beautiful gardens, exception swimming pool, good breakfast and extremely warm and friendly staff, who were extremely helpful. Location was also great- handy to beach and local shopping."
ME & my Wife stayed at Adi Dharma. The Staff was polite and was very kind. They were very helpful & supportive for any request made. The room was neat and clean:)
"This hotel was amazing!!! We enjoyed our stay here and will be coming back again. The staff at this hotel were so lovely and accommodating, they helped with taxis, tours, advice and always made sure we were happy with our stay. The rooms were nice, clean and had a good aircon. Buffet breakfast was great! The hotel grounds were immaculate and very peaceful. Good location as it was close to everything, 5 mins walk from poppies, beach, pubs and the busy centre."
The staff are very courteous and ready to help to your need. The rooms are spacious and served what you need. we had a great stay at the hotel. The pool adds to special amenity. Keep it up and thank you
"I loved the Adi Dharma. I've stayed in many different hotels in Bali, looking for the hidden gem at the right price, and this place is the winner. Pool temperature was not too cold, music at the pool bar created the right atmosphere during the day, lots of people around the pool and great choice of food and drinks. The breakfast menu was terrific, the staff accommodating and professional and they couldn't do enough to make my stay comfortable. The room was a good size with a balcony overlooking the pool area. I really loved it here and I will be back."
"I stayed at the adhi dharma kuta and the one in Legian. The Kuta hotel has a bigger pool with pool bar and features beautiful balinese style gardens with koi fish. The rooms are older but clean with a nice balcony overlooking the garden. The downside is if you are old the shower is inside the bathtub which is extremely deep and can be dangerous when stepping out. Staff are wonderful at both locations. 
Another minor issue there is no access to the beach from the rear of the hotel so you need to walk around to get there although they do have a free transport service to beach if required i believe"
Was amazed by this hotel. The price was unbelievably cheap considering all the facilities. There a pool pool/bar the rooms were very large and clean. Overall an amazing experience!
"Great room & balcony over looking the beautiful pool. Staff are friendly & helpful. My pillow was way to high for me so Housekeeping brought me a soft low one. 
 I wish there were more choices on the breakfast menu, staying 14 days needs variety.  Food cooked nicely & the open air dining room is lovely."
The hotel was in the heart of the walking market on Kuta. You can walk to Kuta beach for 10 mins. Out front of the hotel road is already a market nice for those whom wanted to get a souvenir. Inside the hotel was big with the pool. The room is not so fancy but simple the shower can't be held this was not so convenience for us to shower a young children but it was a small problem it clean by the way. The breakfast was not so much of selection and not so tasty. Anyway was ok for such a price
"But if u are muslim traveller.. please not include breakfast.. it non halal.. 
others is great and awesome.. quite place at nite👍👍"
Very comfortable hotel with the swimming pool and the nicest staff especially Miss Sukrining will make you at home and she will help all your needs.
"The staff were fantastic, they will do anything to accommodate the guests☺️ room was big, comfortable and clean. Great location, excellent pool. Would definitely recommend."
"This is the nicest, best Hotel in Kuta VALUE for money. great staff and facilities.. some people complain but they need to compare value etc to a Hotel like this in their own city.. bloody whingers.. but this is perfect place to enjoy all of Bali and whats on offer....."
"The staff are what stood out for us as the main reason we love ADI Dharma. The managers Dewi & Agung are just the best and all the staff are gorgeous. They have gone out of their way to accommodate several problems we had, including my husband being hospitalised for six days. They drove us to the hospital on several occasions and translated anything we couldn’t understand. They called 2-3 times per day to the hospital to check on my husband even though the hotel had nothing to do with his illness. The rooms are lovely with everything you could need. We’re thoroughly overwhelmed by the warmth of the staff and overall stay 💜💞💜"
"Lovely hotel, super deluxe room was fabulous, just a pity there was so many 'loud' children at the pool which is the fault of parents (not hotel). All our party of six agreed the food was excellent!"
"Overall the hotel is great. You got much more than you paid for. Spacious room. Very clean and comfortable beds, best location and lovely hotel design.  And during our stay we found out we made a terrible booking mistake, and we go to the manager of adi darma hotel, she instantly clear everything for us. Thank you. Will definitly stay here again when I travel back to bali."
"Hotel and stuff are excelent, very close to shopping, restaurants beach also."
Very pleasant hotel to stay . Staff were very welcoming.  loved everything about this hotel.
We had a great time there.
"Great location ,clean rooms snd facilities, lovely staff. Good value for $ here"
"good hotel ,close to legion st nightclubs.nice pool, good breakfast. can walk to beach 10min.great friendly staff, will stay again"
Good spot close to Poppies 2 and to JL Legian the Main Street for shopping.  It was good to be in a dead end street which meant the hotel was pretty quiet.  Recently refurbished outside comfortable inside.  Beds comfy.  Wonderful staff.  The wifi is as most places not wonderful.  All that is Redland desired is to fix the traffic as it’s always quicker to walk anywhere but that’s Bali
"This place has been my families home away from home for many many years. Great value accomodation for those who want the convenience of being in the middle of everything but at the same time a peaceful sanctuary when you aren't out and about. Staff are always accommodating, clean, safe and just a great all round budget hotel"
"Once you step into the grounds of this hotel you forget you are in the middle of busy Kuta. The staff are so friendly, everyone says hello how are you. Our two rooms were big and clean. Breakfast was good each morning.
Would recommend this hotel."
"Awesome hotel, their customer service is second to none.
We always feel like part of the family going here."
"Two thumbs up to the staff and the property . The air conditioning can do with  more cooling, but we found air conditioning a bit underwhelming everywhere in Indonesia so i guess its not a indictment on them alone. The breakfast was satisfying and filling. The pool is pretty big as well. Go ahead and book the place , it is a safe option ."
Keep up the good service... will be back again with friends someday..... keep the Spirit.... Corona will gone soon
Lovely place to stay the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them.
"Stayed here for 3 days recently & really enjoyed our stay - exceeded our expectations. Staff were very good, Balinese hospitality at its best."
"Cannot fault this hotel with our 4th time staying here.. We did have an issue with the room we were given, but they, without hesitation changed our room for us. Beautiful, quiet, king size bed, lots of room, air con perfect. Very happy....again. 
Thank you Adi Dharma Hotel staff.
Older couple from Gold Coast Queenslan Australia"
"Friendly helpful  staff,  good clean facilities. Minimarts and money exchange close by. Family room was large with nice balcony, clean room serviced daily. Bathroom was sufficient, shower inside bathtub might be hard for older people to get in and out of. Included breakfast was great. WiFi was good. We were on the 3rd floor with  no lift which meant climbing stairs which was a bit tiring after a long day being a tourist. Pool was lovely and clean. We ordered room service for a few meals, arrived very promptly and decent price. Hotel entrance tucked away in a quiet lane. 1 minute walk to the hussle and bussel of busy laneways. I would recommend this hotel."
Great little bolt hole in Kuta. Swim up bar and we'll maintained rooms. No problems recommending
Nice staffs. Nice room condition. Not far from beach. I want to stay here again next time.
"I had great value for money which Adi Dharma offered, kind and friendly staff from front desk to Housekeeping. Seems to be well trained staff with great hospitality.  The duty manager Agung was very professional in follow up with each and every guests around the hotel. Annie from spa very friendly and awesome therapist. I had booked for once for spa and had great experience. Food and beverage team was very friendly, especially John in pool bar very friendly and courteous.  Only I have concern is my laundry not been picked up for 2 days in row. I have no idea why they did not take my laundry, since I was checking out next day did not bother much. Apart from that my stay was perfectly awesome.  The location is very close to centre. I would definitely stay again this hotel.  Thank you again to all staff for awesome vacation."
I would definitely come back!
I would definitely come back!
"We really enjoyed our stay at Adi Dharma! The staff are wonderful, consistently checking that you are enjoying the stay. It’s a bigger hotel than I expected but has retained the Balinese authenticity that our family enjoys. Special mention to Desi and Juni who attended to our food and drink requirements while chilling at the pool. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
Amazing location!! Amazing ambience!! Rooms were spacious and clean. All the rooms have private balcony. In-pool bar makes for cherry on the top. Room interiors could have been a bit better...
Breakfast was great and the staff were beautiful.  Wifi was patchy in our original room and someone was smoking below us.   They moved us without delay when asked.  Right in the middle of everything and swimming pool was kept very clean. Bonus slide for the kids.
"Airton, pool and central location. No complaints"
"Quiet & good position. Close to money changer, supermarket, massage spa & shops for bali clothes & trinkets."
"First thing to say is the hotel I am really reviewing is the Adi Dharma in Legian as that is where I stayed as I think they have temporarily closed the Kuta one. Generally the hotel is very nice and the staff are great. The one mistake the hotel made was not telling me to come to their Legian hotel and I went to the Kuta one and had to be sent to Legian. Although I was initially angry about this, the staff were lovely, apologised, listened and assured me that they would make sure this never happened to anyone else. They seem like good people  and I am sure they will do as promised and make sure all customers are informed about the venue change. After this everything became better and I could see that this is a great hotel. The staff are all very cheerful and helpful. When I dropped a bottle they came straight away to help me clear up is one example of this but I could give a few. The breakfast was Indonesian, along with coffee and orange juice my son and I had the nasi goreng every day and it was nice. The pool is lovely and warm and a great place to relax. Rooms also had a safe which is great to protect your things. Generally an excellent hotel."
"If ur a business traveller and need reliable internet, be wary of staying here. I couldnt connect my laptop in my room to the weak internet signal upstairs and the solution was provided by the very helpful staff to set my laptop up on the balcony. This worked well but was a bit impractical, especially when it was raining.
The hotel overall is in a wonderful quiet location but still easy walking distance to central Kuta.
The staff were always very polite and helpful. Cannot fault them at all."
"Just perfect at end of tiny quiet little street, lovely grounds, generous room, comfortable, huge bed, wonderful staff, fantastic breakfast with great choice and quality"
Nice place. Very accommodating staff. Nice pool. Even though I would recommend getting a room far from the pool if you are not a morning person. Good room service. Overall very nice stay and relaxing.
The hotel is the best. Only the access road very small for the car.
"Incredible staffers, grounds are super & inviting, Breakfast is typical.
But a great bang for a buck"
"Friendly staff clean nearby everything 
Traditional Bali garden amazing great price don’t like staying anywhere else"
"The hotel is old but it’s maintained well.Nearby a lot of shops and restaurants.I would like to thanks hotel staff (Sri, kunda and Aryani) for making my stay memorable"
"We keep coming back!!!! 
Beautiful grounds!
Spotless rooms!
Wonderful food!
Delicious cocktails!
Happy and helpful staff! 
Awesome location!
Cool bar-pool! 
Safe and secure!"
Great hotel amazing staff only down side was nearby nightclub noise but didn't effect our sleep
The location is great and the staff were very accommodating and so lovely. I would highly recommend the cottages and would definitely stay here again. I also liked that I could also access the other facilities at the hotel.
Great place beautiful garden value for money
"Spacious room, beautiful gardens and a nice pool. Relaxing!
Staff helpful and friendly!"
Loved everything about this Hotel
"Awesome location, clean. Restaurants at your fingertips. Basic accomodation worth the experience! Breakfast is cheap and cheerful"
Great value for money. Catered to families and older people really well. Location was a short walk from most things. Premises was clean and quiet. Staff were friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back.
"We were left in a position to change holiday arrangements due to cruise cancellation and ended up at this hotel, we found the experience most enjoyable. Found the staff very friendly and their language understanding very good, breakfast was good but dy the end of 12days menotinous. The location is good with a short walk to the beach and Legion street the rooms were quite good very clean, the grounds were beautiful and well kept the swim up bar was fun but be aware to check you're bill before leaving as on the last day we were over charged for drinks we did not have. But all in all nice place would defiantly come back"
"This is generally home base for the first few days in bali. It’s situated close to everything and a great place to start a holiday. Cheap and cheerful. Clean and well serviced. 
Staff are very welcoming .
First timer or return traveller, you will love this old gem!"
"We really enjoyed our stay, the staff upgraded our room for free. The breakfast was great, the facilities is lil bit old but we dont have issue with that. 1 thing,  maybe you need to check the minibar everyday, because out of nowhere we experienced that they wanted to charge us for minibar. After we explained that we never took, staffs checked and apologise."
"The hotel is very beautiful with lush coconut trees , gardens and fish ponds around it . Beautiful balconies where you can sit and enjoy the view. However it would have been nice if there was a Mini fridge in my room . Location its far from the beach . You need a moter bike or taxi to go there. Staff are very friendly and helpful."
The best place in legian
"The hotel and grounds are very well kept and everything is beautiful.  The staff are kind and helpful as well.  However, all of my (clean) towels smells like smoke - like someone was smoking when they folded them.  It was also unbelievably loud (not due to the hotel itself)., While I was there I saw many very large families whose kids seemed to enjoy running and screaming all over the grounds,, while the parents ignored them and drank by the pool.  The amount of empty beer bottles by the pool was staggering.  The pool was so loud all the time time that I could never go down there to relax.  People also sat out on their balconies blasting music (competing with others who wanted to blast their music louder). The room above me had a loud party and were yelling and stomping until 3am,.  I *loved* that my room overlooked the koi pond, but kids kept spending time throwing food at the fish (despite the sign warning them not to) and at one point a kid was in there wading and trying to catch one while others cheered him on (and no parents to be seen).  I know that this is in no way the fault of the hotel itself, but what was to be a relaxing end to my amazing vacation was instead full of screams, loud music, drunk people, and kids out of control.  Despite the hotel's beauty I wouldn't stay here again."
"Very Comfortable, Staff Very Friendly
Aircond not very cold but you may request extra fan with hotel."
"It's always amazing when you make your way through the hustle and bustle of Kuta and suddenly arrive in a quite oasis of Balinese lifestyle. This is a great low-cost option with good rooms, nice pool, beautiful gardens and excellent value for money. We enjoyed every minute here."
"The hotel room is worth it since there is so much space with things like shampoos,coffees, and etc. There are also some fun things to do there such as reading, swimming, and eating."
"Quiet hotel close to Kuta beach (halfway). Good atmosphere, nice staff members. The only drawback is that the neighbours behind the fence were burning trash every single day, so the smell outside the room was really bad (we had deluxe room)."
"Would recommend others to stay here. Reasonable price, clean place, the team were coming in during the day once we were out and making the bed. No issues"
"For $55 a night couldn’t go wrong, close to poppies II, rooms good size. Tucked away off main streets, reasonably quiet but ok for families 🙏👍"
"Lovely complex, well maintained.
Swimming pool is a bit shaded so the water can be fresh. A few room issues but staff were more than obliging to fix promptly.
Cocktails are pricie. Food menu priced fair.
Room cleaned every day, bed made every day (may have even been new linen), bathroom towels smelt like they had been near a fire (smoky wood fire smell).
I found it very comfortable."
Highly recommend pool access room.
For family
"Near to beach, market and airport"
Love it here
"Tucked away a bit but easy walking to everything. Staff I cannot day enough about. Just outstanding. Bali staff are good in general but these guys go an  extra 10 miles. Wow. So helpful.
Beautiful room but no hot water in shower. I didn’t have time to query this so not sure if it could have been fixed or is normal.
If your looking for swim up bar, this is it!"
We love the breakfast and the room. Nice pool with with bar. Beautiful garden and reception areas. Helpful staffs.
"The location was excellent and we liked the stay, great Service Adi Team"
Top hotel.     All good
"We stayed here for a week, when we arrived we were put in a room with alot of noise out side. asked to be moved & there was no issues. Air con was cold. location is central but sometimes hard to get to with traffic. laundromat close by & plenty of little 7/11s.  Nice pool with good music."
"Great place and good location. It was walking distance to the night life and beach, but tucked away in a quiet alley.  Good sized rooms and everything worked."
"Worth the money but the breakfast doesn't have many options
حلو وفخم ولكن اكله لا يصلح للعرب مافيه الا بيض او بانكيك وكله عجين"
"Cosy, family friendly and cost effective its a hidden gem 💎"
"Stayed at the airport dharma 20 years ago and been back 3 or 4 times since. Always good, great staff, great location, 👍breakfast
..good value. Walk to bars in legion and kuta"
In the middle of Kuta but quite at night.
... in the middle of Kuta. Very nice experience.
Hotel is in great location with plenty of restaurants and shopping near by. It’s off the main road so you can relax in the pool area without listening to traffic. The staff were friendly but sometimes it became  a little annoying when they asked the same questions. The hotel is a little outdated but if you’re looking convenience this one will do.
Great place to stay for all ages - we loved it
"We had down stairs room reasonable size with patio and chairs not far from a large enough pool with swim up bar .breaky  basic  ,eggs anyway bacon tomato, help yourself noodles and rice plus pancakes and fruits. Bit of a walk to beach ,10-15min down lane but plenty bars and shopping around and deli. Would recommend to Anyone  on a budget"
"Stayed here for 4 days in October 2022. The hotel is located right in the middle of Kuta and has is near to the main Kuta region along side the Kuta beach and other markets for shopping. 
The hotel doesnt have a lift or escalator. Rooms were spacious and clean enough for a decent price."
"This is an older style hotel with a huge pool, nice garden and traditionally built dining area. The food is good, service great and staff friendly and helpful. Not far from the beach, restaurants and shops."
"The hotel was well located and clean.
Staff are very nice and the breakfast was great and had a wide selection of food.
I would recommend to stay here, there is a very nice pool inside as well."
"The hotel was surprisingly good for the price.  Rooms are large and have a balcony overlooking the pool or a well maintained tropical gardens.  The hotel is not very close to the beach - a good 10 minute walk away, but they apparently do have a shuttle to drop you off at the beach.  
The room rate includes a good buffet breakfast. 
Overall a most enjoyable stay."
"Hotel is very clean and pleasant. Staffs are friendly. Having breakfast at their restaurant  is breeze, such a nice ambiance."
"Our stay at the Adi Dharma was only 3 nights, however, the hotel was great value for money. Great location in the heart of Kuta, staff were friendly, however, a little slow to fix an issue with my air-conditioner. Breakfast was enjoyable and the pool area was nice, lovely gardens, well maintained. We would definitely stay again."
"Really good location while being in central Kuta but still back enough that it isn't loud or busy out the front. 
Room was big and had an amazing balcony view over the pool (room 225) however was really dissapointed by the day long construction on the room next door to us that started at 8 in the morning until evening. It was loud and went all day!
the pool is great and the staff are lovely. 
Breakfast is average 
Very convenient walking through the cottages to get to the hotel too :)"
"Pros -the rooms are nice and a good size. Staff friendly and polite. Nice, large relaxing swimmimg pool. Cons - reception manageress was  friendly at check-in, but  rude and uninterested when you check-out, she forgot to order our taxi for our trip to the airport and was annoyed when we asked for an update on it's arrival. DON'T buy a cocktail at the swimming pool bar, they are expensive and taste like it has zero alcohol in it.....why don't Asian bars understand that if they serve a strong cocktail you will buy another, and another, but if they water it down with near zero alcohol you will only buy one."
"Gardens well maintained and staff are lovely. It is a family resort so expect kids around pool as well as folk who ""book"" their shaded sunbed all day by leaving towel on it. Room was nice and quiet but don't like using bath for shower, especially with no mats. Upon checkin you'll be given plethora of cards.... Door, security pass, towel cards.... Oh and 500,000 rupiah deposit (can be used in bars/restaurant etc) that will be refunded upon departure."
The place is strategically located with beach and food place at walking distance. Breakfast was basic but the staffs are friendly and always ready to help.
"The hotel is perfect for those that are budget conscience. The rooms are clean although rough around the edges and need some maintenance. If you have someone in a room above you, you will hear every footstep they take because it reverberates and if you have someone in a room opposite you and they let the door slam, it also reverberates. So whoever is awake first in the morning dictates when you will be waking up. 
The pool is clean and sparkly and the pool music is not too loud. The staff are amazing and I thought the restaurant food was nice too. The breakfast became monotonous after day 3. The same thing every day and limited selection. 
If you are budget conscience then yes stay here, it is basic, clean and pleasant."
Lovely hotel with great staff.  Freindly & very helpful.   Good price.  My only dissapointment was the food.  Recommend book minus meals.  Some good places to eat nearby.
"Very nice hotel with beautiful architecure even though without an elevator. Very quiet place suitable for relaxing.
Location far from beach with small road. No problem if using motocycle"
"The room is clean and the staff is friendly. But, the water intencity for shower is not strong enough and wait for few minues to be warm."
"Good rooms and 1floor rooms balcony spacious, small pool but ok, only problem is halls are noisey/ loud sounds eco outside"
This hotel is Bali.
Wonderful staff- nothing too much trouble. Lovely and quiet. Just make sure you ask for lower floor if not able to do steps.
Direkomendasikan
"This place is fine for a cheaper alternative. The breakfast is pretty limited, my room I found to be very dark even with lights on and curtain open (it didnt allow for very much natural light), the location is tucked away a bit, and the bathroom could do with some updating. All this said, it's pretty cheap so doesn't break the bank by any means."
"It's not beach front it's not a resort but is a well priced location that you walk to your options of shops, spas, restaurants, clubs and restaurants or just flop into the pool.  Rooms are getting tired but bathroom has been recently refurbished with gleaming clean  tiles (and grout)"
No Indian breakfast
"Very good value for money 
Lovely gardens and nice pool area"
"Good location and bad staff , im chekin on 11 pm and they say the room is full and then change to legian hotel, the staff is not helpfull . Please check the staff especially the security is not polite.."
