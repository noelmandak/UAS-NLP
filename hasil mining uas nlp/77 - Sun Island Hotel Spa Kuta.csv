"The hotel and the staffs are excellent.
Booked 3 deluxe rooms and 2 rooms upgraded to superior for free. The rooms are quite spacious and clean as is near the pool my family  had super time.
My negative feedback is the breakfast, very limited, maybe because they just open 16 rooms out of 130 since the pandemic also you can hear the noises very loud everytimes someone had group conversation and opening and closing the doors from different rooms at night.
Otherwise we had great time."
"I've stayed at this hotel for a week. I was very impressed with the friendliness of all the staff. Tbh the food choices are limited, but the taste is quite delicious. The rooms are spacious and it looks like all the rooms have a balcony. The rooms are very comfortable and the tv channels are varied. I would recommend choosing a room with pool access, but rooms without pool access are also comfortable :)"
I was completely satusfied with the hotel and the service. It was clean and good location
"the staff good, from desk office until room service good, big room, clean, i will be back to  this hotel"
"I went for business travel ,. Location very strategic , near from resto, mall and mini market , ATM
neae to kuta beach...just walk around.
Hotel room clean , nice. Specially for pool view. Very cozy."
"I was very satisfied with this hotel. It was clean and comfortable,the staff were lovely and I will stay there again. I highly recommend this hotel Good location , great restaurants nearby !"
"We stayed here only for a night for a transit. The hotel got everything we need, price is very affordable and yet the room feels luxurious and very clean. Staff is helpfull and service is excellent."
Even the hotel near the road..but still we can relax & enjoy our stay here..clean & nice pool..
"Semuanya bagus…
Lokasi bagus,hotel bagus,kolam bagus,bfast enak."
"Sun island was nice hotel , nice location in kartika plaza so not too crowded when we were out from hotel and back again. 
And i was lucky , i got free room upgrade direct to pool access. 
The reception was nice and always keep smile. 
Will back someday. Tq for the hospitality"
"I love this hotel, Made me feel like home"
"i spent 2 night at sun island kuta . i got an upgraded room, i got pool access+bath tub. hot water always ready. i love staying here. the staff very responsible and kind. thank you"
"Good location,clean and friendly staff"
"Rooms so comfortable, I slept so well at this hotel"
Very helpulfully staff and friendly. Me and my mom had such a good time. Thank many thanks
"Good location,  great services, & good accomodation"
MY KIDS HAVING FUN 🤩
Good price good value. Rooms are nice. Clean. Breakfast was not too good.
"Good location and beautiful rooms the only downside is the noises 
You can hear everything when someone talking loudly from next room and passer by at night."
"It was a pleasant and comfortable stay with friendly and helpful staff.  The location was very strategic to malls, F & B outlets, souvenirs shops and most of all Kuta Beach to watch the sunset and surfing."
"Got the best bang for my buck, considering its price and its close vicinity to the airport and beachwalk, would definitely visit again"
Easy access to kuta beach
"Staff were great and friendly. Bed was big and comfy
Although there was a Centipede crawling in my room, a call to reception and they send people immediately to catch it and offer to spray the entire room including wall gaps."
Best place to stay with group or family or solo
Really a good hotel to stay
"Excellent Hotel
Unfortunately covid has affected business
Great rooms!!"
Good Hotel with basic amenities.
Great location
"Hotel is OK and staff were very friendly but I was in room 115, ground floor in a corridor and facing backwards. It has an outside area out the back which is mostly covered in plastic roofing so it's dark, very humid where the air can't escape and noisy when it rains. I'm sure rooms facing the pool with a balcony are much better. I was only there one night so didn't bother asking to change rooms and would probably have given higher stars of I was in one of them."
Middle of town Kuta..
Loved my stay here.
"Good Room with good location in the heart of bustling Kuta 
Good breakfast and clean"
"We stayed here for 4 days in a pool entry room.  This is my 3rd stay and I like this value for money hotel.  
The hotel is clean located very close to discovery and lippo malls which is why I love it.
Would stay again,  staff are awesome"
To bad they don't have gym room.
"We ordered the suite type and it’s very spacey. The employees are all friendly and helpful. The only things that we dislike are there are no cool white light bulbs so the rooms are quite dimmed (it’s hard for women to get ready early in the morning), and there is no gym available yet."
Not too noisy and good location
"Good location, clean room, good hotel, close to the airport, friendly staff but the breakfast menu very limited choose."
"a nice standard interiour hotel
but very quiet with no extra
i stay 2 times one night for a good price 
a big big room, big bathroom, nice quiet place. if you want extra restaurant nice service stuff better you go other place.
breakfast very expensive for only toast..
and honstly i could early check-in but pity my room was not clean..
but for the price you get a big room"
most definitely come back
Well if it's your first day in Bali then you can start from this hotel. Its in centre of kuta street. Nearby area market and small shops all are good.
"Have to asked to change linen in 1st day due to the 'seems like blood'. The guy came.... Without smile or say hello, just change the linen than left. Hospitality was zero."
"Great hotel with very friendly staffs and excellent location, just at the heart of Kartika Plaza Kuta..
However, I found the cleanliness of hotel room is very poor.. the bed headboard was all dusty, chairs and tables were dusty and the floor is dirty too (my feet became all black after I walked barefoot in the room).
They really should increase their level of hygiene.."
i love the nice enviroment
"This hotel located in Kuta area. Very good location, there are many shop and restaurant arround hotel."
"Still recovering from covid impact, poolside rooms excellent, room 102 still needs work, particularly bathroom, bath very mouldy. Room service menue terrible but assured it will be back to normal by January. Room lighting very poor need to get rid of ""warm"" light bulbs and insert ""cool"" light bulbs to increase light. Would I book again, yes, definitely if their proposed renovations, both rooms and menus are are acted on."
Will be better when fully open restaurant only open foe breakfast but many restaurants nearby.  Spa also not open but they helped my to booked another just down the road. Many drain flys in bathroom or would have given a higher rating.  Rooms very good size and bed very comfy.
"The hotel lift is not working. The coridor is so dirty like it's never been clean, so many mosquitoes in the room but you can ask the house keeping to spray insect killer. But the positive thing, the room is quite okay n clean and you can refill your water because they provide you with the water dispenser in each coridor."
Poor facilities maintenance
"I was looking forward to bringing my children here to stay as we have had great experience before unfortunately it needs some maintenance done to it. Lots of missing tiles  in the pool, the floor is very slippery after getting out the pool not ideal for pool access room with children. Breakfast is very disappointing. We shortened our stay and moved to another hotel."
Has the potential to be a good hotel..Good location  and good layout..breakfast poor especially for a westerner and rooms and bathroom need and upgrade and unblock drains..pool so over  chlorinated eyes wnr immediately red. And not sure of the purpose of the rush bridge going over pool..
"There’s no indication that hotel was not operating 100% due to outbreaks of covid19, hence we came for check in none of the facilities are open apart from pool and restaurant is only open for breakfast with awful quality of food which make as decided to leave the hotel the next day right after we arrive."
"Old hotel, the room was smelly and dark.. bathroom was dirty, sink was clogged, towels smell not nice. Not recommended at all. However  the location is very good"
Recommended for short stay if you are looking for cheap option in city area. Don't expect too much.
"we stayed at the sun island kuta for four nights in end mar/early apr and really liked the hotel. it's very new and just meters away from the discovery mall that houses sogo and other fun stores, from dorothy perkins and m&s to guess. also, beachwear brands like billabong & quiksilver. the discovery plaza strip also features a great line-up of cafes and restaurants. sun island is one of the smaller ones on the street, but is stylish, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. the daily breakfast was decent and you can get omelettes freshly made to go with your bacon. we also liked that the hotel allows you to take your pool towels to the beach - even if it's one that's a distance away. on our arrival, the staff had left two swans made of towels on the bed and strewn it with rose petals for the ""honeymoon couple"" - the category we always tick despite not having mentioned that my boyfriend's birthday was during our stay, they had realized this (from his passport) and snuck into our room with a birthday cake, complete with candles - that was a nice personal touch the strip behind the hotel makes for a very romantic walk at night, as it's by the beach and passes all the other hotel gardens which are lamp /lantern-lit once it's dark. sitting on the beach at dusk and watching the planes take off in the distance from ngurah rai airport is quite an experience - so that's a must-do  the famous kuta beach where you can learn to surf is a 20-minute walk away from the hotel. the surrounding area is also full of restaurants & excellent spas -one to try is febri's, great packages at very good prices. for families with kids, the waterbom park is just across the road from the hotel and discovery mall. sun island kuta (which by the way, features a touch screen lift is definitely a cool little hotel - just don't pick a poolside room as it can get noisy. ours was facing the back garden and it was great. we'll be back"
"We had a good stay in Sun Island Hotel. It is centrally located in Kuta (just beside Discovery Hotel/Discovery Mall and walking distance from Kuta Beach, WaterBom Park, Kuta Art Market and some other good establishments.) I booked a De Luxe Pool View Room on our first day and a De Luxe Room (cheaper room) the next day.  On our second day, instead of transferring us to a De Luxe Room, they just stayed us on that same Pool view room we used on our first day without extra charge so it is really a big PLUS point. Though they don't offer wide variety of food, we still enjoyed our breakfast there (WATERMELON, BACON and CHEESE OVERLOAD..hahaha). The foreign exchange stationed in their reception area also has the best rate among other foreign exchange within the vicinity of Kuta thus even if we were already checked out, I went back there just to have my money changed. On the contrary, I would not recommend to avail their airport pick up service as their rate is way too high (double or triple the price) than getting a metered taxi from the airport. Other than that,I have nothing against to say to Sun Island Hotel and would definitely recommend it to travelers. Indeed, it is worth the price."
"we was in kuta bali for 3 nites, first two nites we stayed in hard rock hotel and decided to try any hotel in kuta area on our last nite that is near the airport. our kind tour guide mr wayan sutama introduced us to sun island hotel n we decided to have a view n he drove us there for viewing. we liked it the moment we step the lobby.we strait away booked the room via agoda - much more cheaper. we have a late check in since we have a full day tour. we reached the hotel roughly about 11pm and theres a few other groups came on the same time but surprisingly we have been welcome with a smile from the start even there are such a mess n busy, but they spare a little time to acknowledge your present. im impressed. the gave us welcome drinks n the check in was fast. they told us they dont have the deluxe room we requested n upgrade us to the deluxe pool view. lovely n lovely n lovely hotel..since we went there already 11pm n the shops are all closed n the town was already shut but we definitely enjoy our room. clean, well kept, nice toilet, nice breakfast..i coudnt ask for more but then our time was too short. i recommend everyone to stay here..its in the heart of bali,even congested when the road is busy but u can always walk around because every shops an shopping alley is near to each other. incase anyone need a ride to the airport just take a blue meter taxi. cheaper than the hotel airport transfer charge. if anyone would like to have their personal tour guide .. such a good n nice tour guide i ever see. so patient.he's the one who introduce us to this hotel anyway. he should be given a credit also by this hotel..ill come back definitely will stay in this hotel!"
"First, I want to thank you for agoda, this is our 4th time we booked hotel by this website.and all service about the hotel we booked really impressive!!.when we arrived at this hotel, we surprised for the hotel design,reaaly nice,and when we open our room, we found the towel arrangement dove-shaped,fresh flower bucket, and cake, all is for our honeymoon, I reaaly forget that I have notice by agoda that we stay for honeymoon.and when we arrived at airport, a driver hold a paper with my name, that was my notification to by the web. This hotel really great,located center of the kuta city,many stores and mart surrounded.we tried the local food restaurant next to the hotel, bebek tepi sawah, reaaly nice, but quite expenzive. At the morning we have breakfast at the hotel, this is the one that that I never expect, we got so really various food, as international breakfast as 5star hotel,really impressive,many different foods every morning, we stay for 3 days, so know the differences.this hotel also have driver and car service, with local price, we rent for full day with our destination, the driver so kind and polite. And at 3rd day we rent a motorcycle that next to this hotel, really cheap price for full day rent. Sun island have many good point if I see than the any other hotel with same price at this kartika plaza road hotel.the design,staff, room service and cleanliness,breakfast,transport n sighseeing, you don't need to worry everything when stay at this hotel. As indonesian, I see all of this hotel guest is foreigner,many australian,japanese,korean. Maybe I'm the only local when we stay there. Great hotel,great service.I must stay at this hotel for my next bali holiday.really reccomended hotel!!"
"my wife and 9 year old daughter together with my in laws spent 4 nights here. the hotel is well maintained and rooms are adequate in size. the breakfast was great with good variety. the hotel is located right next to the discovery mall, so food was not a problem at all. the more popular legian beach was about 3 km away and is walkable as the entire stretch is lined with shops and restaurants. there was also a roman catholic church about 1 km away so we did not miss the weekly mass obligations. the only negative point about this hotel is the small and shallow pool but my daughter still loved it.

this was our 3rd trip to bali but the previous 2 times we stayed at the aston kuta hotel and residence. if its a bit more quiteness and better pool that you seek, it would be aston but sun island wins hands down for location.

all in all we would give sun island hotel a thumbs up and a hotel worth the price."
"My partner and I stayed at Sun Island two years ago and he really liked it so we came back when we recently visited Bali again.  Sun Island Kuta is located is a really convenient area where it is just next to Discovery Mall, Waterbom and many great restaurants along Jalan Kartika Plaza. We got the room that faced the back of the hotel instead of the swimming pool this time (could be possibly due to the type of room we booked). The good point about not facing the pool - you get a quieter room. We also tried their body massage and organic facial. As a couple we were able to do in the same room without extra cost. We remembered the breakfast being a great spread, however this time, unfortunately we didn't really get to enjoy the buffet as we were out for surfing lessons before breakfast started. The hotel provided breakfast box with three different options for you to choose from, which can be improved. Overall, another great experience at Sun Island!"
"I think sun island hotel was my right choice to stay. My room is big enough, the amenities are complete and changing every day. This hotel also near with discovery mall, waterboom,kuta square, and also beach. I also easy to get any kind of food around there eventhough the price little bit expensive (however i get book of discount for any kind of food in south kuta). Maybe it's would be good is this hotel also facilitate the spa&massage because when i wanna get spa I must get from another place. Another disadvantage is there is no lift from parking area so it makes me difficult when i bring trolley if i use stair."
"I had been to Bali last month and stayed in Hotel Sun Island for 7 days. I must say this hotel is a great place to stay in Bali. Hotel is centrally located in Kuta and well connected with airport. One can enjoy roaming in Bali downtown in the evening with all good restaurants, malls, cinemas, markets, pubs around this hotel. Staff of the hotel is kind and very helping. Cleanliness and hygiene is well maintained. Hotel encloses a big swimming pool with good facilities for both adults and children to enjoy. Breakfast included variety of food everyday including Indonesian and continental cuisines. The rooms were big and equipped with all required facilities. One thing to mention about rooms is transparent glass fitted in the bathroom wall and curtain to cover the glass is given outside the bathroom. I did not understand why glass is given in bathroom wall? If it was by design, then they should provision curtain inside the bathroom."
"The location of Sun Island Hotel Kuta is good, Discovery Shopping Mall, convenience stores, local warungs and restaurants, and of course, Kuta Beach just a stone's throw away.
We stated that we were going on our honeymoon on the special requests section during the reserving of the room, and they actually surprised us with a strawberry cake a few minutes after checking in. It was a pleasant surprise and a nice touch by the hotel staff. Also, the bath tub was half filled with water and rose petals. Lovely.
The Pool Access room that we had was very clean (I think this hotel is still relatively new?) and the furniture were all in good condition. We enjoyed chilling out in front of the pool, yet within the comfort and privacy of our room (well, a few steps away from the room, that is).
A minor flaw with the room would be the bath tub/shower area. I think due to aesthetic reasons, they decided not to install a shower curtain. So our showers would end up wetting part of the toilet. Also, due to the structure of the bath tub (lack of proper drainage at the sides of the tub), water would collect and gradually flow down to the toilet floor. We managed to limit the wetting of the toilet by using the floor mat and face towels.
The breakfasts were quite boring as they only rotated a few of the dishes, the rest were the same day after day. Taste-wise it was so-so. Not a problem since we mostly spent most of our time outside (awesome and cheap food at the local warungs).
Overall we were pleased with our stay here. Highly recommended."
"Sun Island Hotel is an awesome hotel my husband and i ever been to. The staff gave us the 5/5 rating hotel service! The hotel doesnt look like a hotel. It looks like a resort to us. We're glad we got the swimming pool access room. Such a beautiful place. The buffet is also an awesome one. Though we a muslim couple who didnt eat pork and drink alcohol, they served pork and put it seperately with non-pork food. My husband and i was thinking if ever we come back to Kuta, we are damn sure we will go back to Sun Island as Sun Island never disappoint us. Thumbs up n SUPERB!P.S: We just dont like the swimming pool as the chlorine water is so high that got us sorethroat while swimming and the sudden pain in the nose (as we accidentally suck in the water). Overall, Sun Island Hotel Kuta is awesome!"
"i'm a travel agent and have stayed at a few places in bali and normally stay in seminyak or ubud. as kuta accom i have found to be very old and tired looking. but i stayed at the sun island because of other friends wanting to stay in kuta for the first time and found the location excellent! just a 1 minute walk to kartika plaza and all the stalls and massage parlours are around. the hotel rooms were clean and tidy(cleaned everyday), nice comfy beds. pool was lovely, staff gave excellent service and were very prompt and we felt safe and secure. wifi available. a really good price for this 4 star accom in kuta. only thing i could fault them on was the breakfast (there wasn't much choice) but other than that it was great! enjoyed our stay there."
"I have stayed all over Bali, usually with my family (wife & two youngs boys under 5) first time at Sun Island, wish I had chosen this hotel before. The staff are fantastic, the room was spotless, comfortable with great touches like extra large towels and free wifi! The location is obviously as good as it gets in Kuta and for being close to the airport  -  and even my airport transfers (hotel drivers) were their despite flight delays (two hours), quick, happy and polite. I will definitely return to his hotel the next time my business or family brings me back to Kuta. Oh and best breakfast I have had in Bali! Even had crispy bacon, a true rarity in Bali."

"We stayed in the Sun Island Kuta for a week over Christmas 2018 after staying a few months ago in their sister hotel in Legion and both were perfect for our needs. Upon check-in they very kindly upgraded us to a pool access room which was great in size, had everything you could need, a clean bathroom and most importantly, very cool aircon. The hotel is on a great road with plenty of restaurants and bars a short walk away as well as a shopping mall and the famous Waterbom park which is definitely worth a visit. We would not hesitate to recommend either of the Sun Island hotels, if you would like to be set in slightly quieter environment then Kuta is for you, if you like the idea of being a 5 min walk from the very active party scene then Legion is better. We will be booking again this year for sure."
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it was a great stay there! We got upgraded to the Deluxe Pool view room. Location was absolutely great, just a mere 3 minutes walk to discovery shopping mall, waterbom park and the beach. The hotel is located along Jalan Kartika where all the great food places are, including the must visit Bluefin Japanese Fusion and Lounge Restaurant. Front desk staff was very courteous and friendly, breakfast was average but good enough since there is so much to eat in Bali. Wifi signal in the room was quite weak, we sometimes had to stand at the balcony or stay at the lobby for better connection. One thing the hotel was do is to install shower curtain in the bathtub to prevent water from splashing all over the bathroom floor. Would definitely stay in Sun Island Kuta if we visit Bali again!"
"This is my first time staying at Sun Island Hotel Kuta. The staff always smile and greet you. Check-in was a breeze. The room was lovely and nice. EVerything inside the room were in order. There's a balcony just outside your room overlooking the pool and you cn just sit there and relax. The breakfast was okay just right. However, if they have more varieties it would be good. I've stayed 3 nights at the hotel and i found it comfortable and relax. The shopping centre and the seaside is just a walking distance from the hotel and i just love it. There's also small shops by the roadside selling clothes and souvenir. Just a small comment though, maybe the hotel could offer airport transfer without charging a fee when i check out although it was not a big issue. Overall nice!"
"gWe  planned our trip to Bali for our silver wedding anniversary  and we have absolutely no regrets booking at the Sun Island Hotel Kuta. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We had a free room upgrade and a surprise cake in the room upon check-in. The next day the bath tub was filled with colorful flower petals and on our last night, they placed two cute teddies on the bed. Our special appreciation to Chintya Dewi (Reservations) and Dewi from Front Desk and all the other staff for making our stay so comfortable and memorable."
We checked in late after completing a day tour. Pleasantly received by the reception staff and she explained to us about the hotel. Sun Island Hotel is now about 1 year old...a fairly new hotel with great location. Welcome drinks and cold towels promptly served upon arrival. Discovery mall is only about 5 mins walk away. The Kuta beach is easily accessible after passing through Discovery mall. There are many little shops to walk around the hotel too. The hotel room is nicely decorated. Overall the stay is great. We will surely return here if back in kuta again.
"would say this is the best hotel in kuta. it has everything to offer. we had a great stay. the hotel provides free wifi, complimentary dvd player, and even a laptop!!. the breakfast at pavoz restaurant was awesome with lots of varieties on a daily basis catering for both vegetarian and non-veg. 

location - just 5 minutes walk to discovery shopping mall, bali ratu spa is just opposite the hotel, authorized money changer - check with the hotel, tour packages - u may book via the hotel or through any of the travel agencies outside the hotel. 

food - varieties of restaurants around the hotel. from starbucks, pizza hut, domino's, chinese, western, balinese etc...

shopping: go to kuta art market, kuta market, discovery mall, centro and of course matahari. you don't have to take a cab, just walk from the hotel. it takes just 15 minutes. 

good cheap shopping - krisna shopping store!!! a must go! cheap place for souvenir comparing with other outlets at kuta."
"My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at Sun Island Hotel Kuta. We were impressed right from the minute we walked in. Our check in was quick and we were shown up to our room by a friendly staff member. The room was very clean, the bed and pillows were top quality. The bathroom was big and the shower worked really well. We have stayed at other hotels were the plumbing has been a problem but not here. We loved everything about our stay at Sun Island and will stay again and be only to happy to give it high recommendation to others. The location and value for money is excellent."
Convenient to Kuta Beach and nearby to many malls.
"Great location 
Needs a little TLC 
Great bed 
Nice breakfast 
Ok for solo"
"The room is old but clean. The bed and pillow is not so plushy but still comfortable. 
The breakfast was severely lack of variety, it's like a 2 star hotel, but the taste is still quite good. 
The pool access room smells of cigarette, the pool itself is lack of maintenance, the bottom flooring of the pool already detached on some parts, and probably will hurt your feet.
The staff is friendly and helpful."
Older style but serviceable.
"i used to stay in sun island when I was transit in Bali.Before it was clean everything was working and the  breakfast had many options. Now the sheets were dirty,the bathtub was clogged and the tv didn't worked.The breakfast was for 2 star hotel with options only for indonesian."
"I came here 10 years back solo.. was so satisfied n hoping to bring my family one day..n after so long i got the opportunity n brought them n its a total disappointment! 
Worn out hotel ok we understand bcos of pandamic! But cleanliness? Cant they maintain?? Sticky floor, bathroom not clean ,broken shower head,smelly floor and REMEMBER! The lift is broken for a long time n if u get a room in 3rd floor,good luck to u! N one more thing the breakfast..i stayed there 3 nights n i allready memorize the menu , bread , eggs , fried mee, chicken white rice,fruits thats all for every damn day!! Cant they just change a dish to make it unique!! Very dissapointed! Even the pool tiles are all coming out one by one! Dont get deceived by the pics! 
And room making! They didn’t change the pillow case n bedsheets for all the 3 days that they make up our room! How we know? We made a small marking in the items n it was not changed at all! Imagine! 
Btw the location is awesome! Plenty of nice eateries! Shopping places! 
The good thing abt ths room is that the best is really good! N the front desk is helpful.. other then that its a let down!"
Easy to find restaurants nearby. Breakfast was basic. We used to stay in this hotel before covid and the breakfast was excellent.
Kwalitas food n beverages perlu ditingkatkan
"I love this hotel, I stay at this hotel 5 times already and I feel like home. But, they need to keep monitor the room cleaniness..."
"Clean, spacious room, kindly staff, good location with affordable price."
Terbaik..
"Close to the airport.
Good enough for short stay"
Cheap place and friendly staff
"We had one of the best room after 1.5 months of traveling around south asia. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was neat and clean, the lights make the room very cozy, and we even had a ""private garden"". The personnel were very helpful and even gave some tips how to travle around and what to visit in Bali."
breakfast is minimalist. simply dont book your room with it.
"At Bali , Its our first day stay in this hotel and Its near to market and nice place to stay , Worth to money"
"Nice and cozy place, too bad when we came the lift is broken so we need to go to our room by using stairs which was so annoying"
Rooms is very comfy and good size. Value for money for its location. Just 5min walk to discovery mall and a lot of nice restaurants and bar in walking distance. Staff are all very friendly and helpful. Not much of breakfast choice. Will definitely come back and stay there again 😊 keep up the good work guys 👍👍
"Great hotel, great location and very helpful staff as they were more than happy to open my action cam bolt which has a rustic part. 
The food is ok, an improvement is suggested.
Room is decent with nice air con."
good location. walking distance to restaurant.
"Rooms were good. Pool is in need of maintenance. Breakfast very much average, it’s only local food, not worth the money you pay for. My advise, don’t get the breakfast, you can eat out cheaper."
"Sun island hotel is good enough for simple expectation holiday maker.
If you are looking for hotel that connected to the beach than this hotel may not suit you.."
"We were a group of 8 adults and 1 child. Stayed in the ground floor rooms beside the pool. Great rooms and well appointed. 
Breakfast was usual buffet style. 
Location was away from the hustle and bustle."
No staff in receptionist when check out in early Morning
"I was told by their staff, the lift are not working for years. Hope the owner can fix this problem. 
Breadfast wise not much selection, hope they can improve it."
"The room are warm and comfy, love the interior. Nice and friendly staff, easy to go to Kuta beach by walking for 10min. You can go to Sogo and can have a coffee at Discovery Mall which near to the beach."
"The staff upgraded our room. We had balconies with a very nice view to the pool 😁
We didn't try their breakfast but the restaurant seems clean
The room and facilities are great! It's complete and clean. We booked 2 rooms. The toilet in other room were not 100% working well, but in my room ot was okay.
The staff were friendly and helpful, but the thing that made me worried was the lift. It wasn't working. I brought my parents and worrried about their legs to use the stairs but in the end they said it was find so overall there's no problem. The staff helped us carried all of our luggages and very kind
We were very happy to stay here. Hope we can come back to Bali soon!"
"Great hotel, friendly staff, very nice and amazing room. Can't complain except for the elevator which wasn't working while I stayed. Other than that wonderful!!
Thanks a lot Sun Island Hotel & Spa Kuta 🩷🤗"
"The service of the staff and the location of the hotel are good. 
Planing to stay again there when going to Bali..."
Very old room and have a mosquito
Rooms are big staff very helpful very good location
"Good location. Staffs courteous. 
Breakfast is lousy. Bread old and hard. Ecerything is bland. Does anyone even supervise the quality of food. Clearly not bothered about repeat customers. Disappointed. Only got the room at 430pm..AC bonkers. Floor oily. Had to clean up again. What a pity coz it is a good hotel. Someone not doing their job properly."
"The management should just shut it down for a year and do some upgrading to the rooms. The tour agent said this is a 4 star hotel, sure dont feel like it. More of a 3 star to me. Personally, the hotel just spoilt my family holiday this year. Do not trust the photos you see on the internet!"
There is bad odor smell at the life. Overall its not very clean in the room. Bath with mold and the floor is not clean.  I would not go again
"Great location, good stay. Will be back."
GOOD
GOOD
"i was going the wrong hotel in 1st day when i reach bali, it have another sun island hotel with same name at legian that i search wrong location with grab. But its ok, final i come and check in at 26 nov around 2 pm, the reception girl is so friendly and helpful and bring us to our room, but i doesn't know what her name. 
1. Hotel room look big and worth for the price. But it have some dust around  the room decoration and curtain.
2. Furniture look a little bit old. i hope the hotel will renovation again in the future.
3. Water heater is good in function. But the hotel doesn't provide any hair conditional.
4. The swimming pool is nice but too many sand inside the pool.
5. Breakfast only have few choice, the food same everyday, and the food was very cold. i hope to improve the breakfast.
6. The hotel is in good location, near to airport, discovery mall, waterboom, and kuta beach.
7. The hotel bathtowel was broken, i hope they will change new.
8. At last, i love the hotel staff, they are very polite and friendly. It deserves a 4 star service, but stilll need to improve on some other facility.
i will come to live this hotel again when i come to bali next time."
"It was so noisy on one side of the building facing the street that I almost felt that I was on the street.
The bedsheet was dirty and the blankets were dirty on both side. I will not stay here again."
"I have never thought I would miss this hotel so much after I left Bali. The environment, neighborhood, food options especially the breakfast and the room were excellent. The management was flexible and the amenities were good. I enjoyed every bit of my stay and would book this hotel if I come back to Bali again in future."
Great location very clean and staff were friendly
Nice room and pool.Courteous and helpfull staff.Good location-lots of restaurants/bars nearby.
"Simple and right place to enjoy the most popular spot in Bali.... near Discovery and Lippo shopping mall and the front street, a lot of restaurants and bars open till night...."
