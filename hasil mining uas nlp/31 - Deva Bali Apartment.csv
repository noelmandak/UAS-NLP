"My experience has been amazing. Helpful staff, convenient location and a value for your money! - I definitely recommend the place."
"If you planning to not do staycation, then this apartment is best suited for you since its comfortable to sleep. But its not recommended to everyone who plan to do staycation since its missed a few key facilities fpr staycation like pools."
"Amazing place, nice and clean rooms! The staffs are super friendly. 5 stars!"
I like this place! All the staff are amazingly incredible.. and very clean with the rate that also affordable! I like the rooftop that show you there view and facing right to the Bali sunset! I will be back to Bali just to stay in the same place again
So kind staff and great location so clean room & big room
"Been coming for over 6 years to these apartments. Great location, everything you need for a great stay."
"Good kitchen area, comfortable beda, great location. Lovely staff"
"We must have stayed at Deva 30 times. It is cheap, clean, quiet. The staff are lovely and friendly. We have air con, tv, fridge and breakfast."
"very close to Pepito to get grocery, not far from the beach, it's located between Canggu and Seminyak.  it's a very convenient place to stay for a long time"
"I will give full recommendation for Deva Apartment, they already prepared for the new normal Era."
"Very good price , people and location"
"mins tooth brushes and tooth paste, but its ok
the staff was so good❤️"
One of the best apartments I have lived so far in Bali!
Highly recommended and very affordable
All perfect!!
Best place to stay in bali!!!
"The room was cleaned and the fresh lemon scented in the room made it more welcoming. It has kitchen in it, kitchen tools included, which was very convenient for me to boil water and cook my own meals. Definitely looking forward to stay at this apartment again."
pasti next kesini lagi
"Been coming here for years, lovely little Apartements have everything you need for a comfortable stay..."
"The room is super clean and comfortable and the staff couldn’t be more lovely and helpful! 
They also helped me rent a bike for a week :) 
Thank you 🙏🏻"
I enjoyed staying at this apartment. It's  pretty affordable. It has kitchen with the necessary kitchen tools for me to cook my own meals. There are two convenient stores nearby (Alfamart and Indomaret) and Pepito Market if you need something quick to eat.
"As a last-minute deal, this was good value. It's a very quiet alley in a central Kerobokan location. My room had a couple of maintenance issues which were repaired promptly, and the place is generally looking a bit tired after Covid. Staff were friendly and helpful."
"With this rate, you get hot water to shower, large fridge, kitchen with stove, pan, glass, plate, spoon & fork - complete all you need. 
Thats why don't complaint for the small things.
Salute to Mba Asti & team (kadek etc), as friendly as our home assistance and check for all our need is serve. 
Will be back for sure"
"I stayed on the first floor, i think the room is very humid and no sun light. I dont really like it. After all, every other thing was fine, the staffs and service is very kind and helpful, the facilities are great."
"rooms are worth the price, I like the friendly and very helpful staff, poor internet for the 2nd floor, dirty and broken cooking utensils, maybe I was unlucky and got facilities that didn't have a coffee maker, adequate cleanliness and rooms are suitable for travelers, so far I am comfortable because the place is quiet..I will be back next time."
Great experience to stay here despite need some improvement in some aspects but overall is great to stay here.
like i shud
All was good. The staff were so nice and helpful for all the time. Will come again for sure
"Friendly staff,good place to stay"
It’s a cheap place so didn’t expect the service will be excellent. Even got free breakfast during my whole stay! Amazing!
This is my to go place to stay and relax now. I enjoy staying here.
Nice apartment in good location
Standard room with kitchen. Not so small and there's a balcony. It's my go to place to transit before flight!
"Good location, room are spacey though no wardrobe. They have sofa. Tv are old. Room needs more cleaning tho"
"It has decent necessities that you need during your stay, the staff will also help you to rent a motor bike at affordable price. The location itself is ok."
"Cozy place, and best service"
Very good for what you pay for. No complaints except for cleanliness. The bathroom was quite dirty and so was some of the furniture and room.
You can have apt studio facilities including the nice staff❤️
The place was not perfect but still it was nice for the price paid. Also the staff was very kind as they fixed the broken lock within days.
"First when we arrived they give a room with bad smells and molded walls. Then the next day we change to another room with slightly better condition. Overall, it was okay ."
"Apartment nya kecil, dan agak kurang terawat. But so far its okay lah, sesuai dengan harganya."
Great place friendly staff 👍
"Small room with not much light, but ok for 1 night. Comfortable bed. Cleanliness could be improved"
"Good size room, reasonably quiet, but the room was  only cleaned once in the 6 days I was there. I had to ask for a clean towel and water."
"+ Staff and welcome
+comfortable bed
- old dirty sheets
- place needs some new colour on the walls, a makeover"
"It's an apartment style, they will send you breakfast every morning (but there's no option, they decide the menu). Room is small actually, they try to fit the tiny kitchen and small sofa with king sized bed. But if you spend most of your time outside then it's no problem. Room can feel damp because there is actually not much ventilation or even sun shine."
The room was kind of run down and depressing. Staff were great tho!
This place fit for you who wants a budget trip
Most guests coughing sick -c virus?(( Staff Very Very nice and good
"The receptionist are very friendly and helpful. But the cleaning staff are not. The cleaning staff barged in my room and open the bathroom door while I am showering, thinking the room is empty. They don't change the sheets, only made the bed."
"One of the big mistake during my vacation in Bali. The room was lack natural light, even the single window curtain, it is not possible to open.  A bit dirty elsewhere.
I tried to request high floor before check in also at 2nd day, however the staf couldn't provide the room I requested due room availability.
The rooftop is in poor condition, like ""kapal pecah"".  Just dont believe the photos provided here."
"Unfortunately this accommodation is far from what it appears like online. It is not very clean, room was smelly, and everything was extremely ‘used’ looking.  Online it appears very fresh and modern but this is not the case.
The sofa in the room is like sitting on a wooden plank and the kitchen doesn’t really come equipped with much at all. The bed sheets were also quite stained."
"Deva Bali has a good location, but that's all. Room not that clean, towel and linen is yellow. The worst part is the WIFI. First 3 nights I stay in 3rd floor, I ask to move to 2nd floor to get better signal. U know what? Not even better!"
"The price is good, but not for the facilities. The wi-fi was suck. We got our breakfast packaged by styrofoam. It'll be good if the Hotel maintain their facilities."
"There’s mold on the ceiling of the toilet, the toilet itself is leaking, the bed and blanket was so damp due to high moisture in the room. On the second night we had a cockroach in the room. The staff were helpful and friendly but the room itself is horrible"
Need improvement staff should always look and maintain the cleanliness around the room.
"Terrible. They are cleaning the bathroom, wc, sink and kitchen with the same sponge.. I saw with my own eyes. Later I bought my own cleaning material and cleaned by myself"
"Location was good, but didn’t expect the hotel to be pretty old. It was really dark perhaps they tried to save electricity during covid time. Staffs were ok, thanks."
Bad dampness smell. It's not as nice as the pictures.
"Too many differences between what they have in photo display and their real room condition. Dusty and damp. Old stains on bed sheets. Old blanket. Also, they need a better lighting."
"Dirty bathroom, lot of insects, bad location"
"I scheduled to stayed for 4 night (11-14 sept 2022) , but after some difficulty with the door key (the hotel still used regular key and lock not card) my stuffs locked inside the room and I can’t come in. 
They (the hotel)need at-least 1 day to repair and open my room before i can retrieved stuff that left inside. Check out early (in sept 13) because I don’t feel comfortable, the room look nice but the cleanliness is questionable."
"The rooms are realy so dirty…  the photos which is in agoda are fake, original rooms are not seem like photos a little.. there was a blood sparks in our bed shets! And they did not change it cause of they have not got another clean one. We could not sleep anymore . Checked out early! What a shame…"
no have refund my money until now
"Rats
Ants
And fiesta at the last floor every morning early"
"We enjoyed our stay! And the service provided by Deva Bali Apartment staffs are awesome 👍🏻 With the very affordable price, the staffs are even sending breakfast to the room in the morning. The apartment is very clean with white concept. Thumbs up. The location is a bit from the main attraction in Bali, but the environment there is very good."
"We really enjoyed our  stay in Deva Bali Apartment. Great location and staffs were very accommodating  especially Asti, the receptionist. She's very attentive, helpful and kind. I think she's the one who spiced up our stay in Bali."
"As a solo traveller and using a rental scooter throughout my stay, Deva Bali is an ideal solution that fits the bill  in many aspects.
Should anyone complain for what it offers,please keep in mind the price.
If you're expecting luxury, then this is the wrong place but if you want clean,safe environment,friendly staff and comfy bed...this is where you go!. 
Assuming you have scooter/car."
I booked Deva twice now for my daughter and she likes it there.  Front desk staff are nice  and good service communication. Although for travelers that do not speak Bahasa Indonesia - you may have some troubles communicating.  The location is good between Seminyak and Canggu.  Overall Deva is excellent value with a nice size room and with a kitchenette too.
"Tinggak di deva selama lebih dari 7 hari nyaman banget, kamar bersih, fasilitas lengkap kalau ada yang kurang tinggal call staff disana. Super dimanjain pokoknya. Resepsionis nya baik juga, ramah dan asik. Ada penyewaan motor juga yang diskon buat pengunjung deva! Dekat dari mana2 dan aksesnya mudah, cuma jalan masuknya kurang mulus aja sisanya bagus!! Pokoknya kalau ke bali lg mau booking disini aja!!💕"
"I always had pleasant stay in Deva Bali, their staff was very friendly, Mba Astiti help me a lot with my request and questions since this is my 5 times staying at Deva this year. Keep growing Deva!"
"Deva Bali Apartment is located in the Canggu area of Bali, and not far from several other tourist areas such as Seminyak, Umalas, Kerobokan. The hotel room is quite spacious, and there is a TV, refrigerator, sofa and kitchen set, so you can cook your own food. Wifi is quite smooth, TV channels are limited. The hotel provides motorbike rentals. Hotel's staff also very helpful. Near the hotel's location, there are also several shops and restaurants, so there is no difficulty if you want to buy food or drinks. Breakfast was very limited and has been determined by the hotel, so we cannot choose. Breakfast will be sent to the room when we request. There is no swimming pool in this hotel. One thing that must be considered was, the towels that served in the room were not clean anymore. If you want to travel in Seminyak or Canggu and need accommodation that is not too expensive, Bali Deva Apartment can be an alternative of your choice."
"It's too good to be true to found a cozy place with that price, only at Deva Bali Apartment."
"The staffs were nice, the room was clean enough (actually there was a lizard on the couch but it’s okay). 
At that price, we got a breakfast (Fried Rice + fried Egg). 
We went out at night to Seminyak (Kayu Aya street) with car, and it only took 10 minutes. 
Deva Bali so far is the best hotel under 250.000 rupiah at Bali"
"My Daughter has stayed at Deva Bali several times. Location is good with several nearby places to get food, some warungs that have lower priced local food too."
"We are needing to be in Seminyak each week for buying. We stay at Deva, if we can get in. Always full. So easy, so simple, lovely staff, great bed, great price"
"The experience is definitely exceeding the expectation for how much you paid.  If you book a whole month, it's actually cheaper than most fully furnished apartment in Bali.  It's a bit distant away from most happenings, which is plus for me because it's so quiet at night, but if you are a tourist ... hm ... But price is so reasonable, WI-Fi mostly strong and stable, very clean especially the floor (though a bit humid due to funny bathroom design), still highly recommended if you have your own mean of transport."
"Deva is my second home, i always stay here everytime i come to bali. They have nice staff, spacious room, not in a busy area. Everything is perfect."
"Highly recommend Deva Bali Hotel for great and affordable, clean ang nice staff .. thank you so much"
"Deva always been my favorite place for stay everytime i'm going to bali., The place was so neat and clean, the staff was super friendly, they have a small rooftop too."
"Always stay in Deva everytime i'm going to Bali, they have excellent location, helpfull staff and spacious room."
"The location is perfect between Canggu & Seminyak, i don't know how many times i suggest my friends & my family to stay in Deva. Will come back soon!"
Very happy with our stay at Deva Apartments. Especially the lovely Asti. So helpful and friendly. We will be staying again in the future.
My daughter has stayed at Deva many times and still likes it in comparison to many other places.  The kitchenette is the main better point. Staff know my daughter well and she always gets welcomed back. The location is good too with several low cost places to eat. And also there is a meat shop and veggie markets within  walking distance - and thus my daughter made good use of the kitchenette.
"Nice studio apartment (with your own kitchen), comfy bed and pillows. We had 2 very good nights sleep there. It’s quiet, nice area with supermarkets and warnings nearby (3 mins walk away). Staff is nice, especially Asti from the reception who is really caring about her customers.
I definitely would recommend this place. For the price (11€) it’s a real bargain.
Next time We come to Bali, we’ll go there again for sure"
I booked this for my daughter and she likes Deva.  It has become a favorite for her stays in Bali.
"My daughter is a regular guest at Deva, the staff know her well. Again she did some cooking at Deva and she has showed pictures of her nicely cooked food.  It's not Kuta but still there are several places nearby for getting something to eat and getting food to cook.  All's Well."
"Deva was everything we needed. No, not near the beach but we were staying to do business not holiday. A large room, huge comfy bed, good air con. Bonus  rooftop was good to relax on. We will return."
"Sockets hanging out of the walls, smashed mirror in bathroom balcony 1m x 1m facing a wall and pipework wifi not working only stayed 1 night certainly wouldn't again"
Kamar mandi airnya gak nyala dri pertama check in - check out
"The ambience of the room is nice warm and comfort, the bathroom need more attention for cleanliness and amenity coz they didn't provide toothbrush and toothpaste, please change the photo room as it is in agoda picture, because i didn't get room with the sofa, so i little bit upset about that"
"Deva Apartment has everything you need for such an affordable price. The room I stayed in included hot water, fridge, and a functioning kitchen with equipment and utensils"
"This is our first time to stay in Deva Bali, when we coming to early they prepare our room as soon as possible.. they clean our room as a priority. The staff is very kindness.. but when we coming there, we can't see the rooftop because they have some maintenance. We will come there again next time! 😊"
"The place was run down and not clean, sheets and towels were dirty and the place had a foul smell. Would not recommend this place to anyone."
"Nice place to stay for long stay, clean and well served. The staff are friendly too."
"Staff very helpful, friendly, and kind. Everything is perfect and I got very cheap price thank agoda"
Good
all good
best
Good service
"Nice and friendly staff, value for money and worth because they give you breakfast every single morning and calm environtment"
Good
Good
I like it
Best for budget traveller.  Rent 2 rooms if you're family of four.
i reservation this hotel for one night but end up with 5 nights!!! so i do not think that i have to mention anything so much about here. It is nice and calm and quiet to stay. i Have my breakfast serve in my room every 8-8.30 am every morning. Actually it is a little bit annoyed to wake up to take a food but no complaining for it since all staff so nice and housekeeper also clean my room very well too. Recommend to stay here!!
A/C Not really cool. they had roof top. it's awesome. Car can parking in front of room.
"Asti made the stay phenomenal, she was very helpful and we were very welcome there. There were smokers on the first level whose smoke travelled up through our toilet, Asti had politely told them to smoke at the front instead. Laundry was also promptly taken care of at 9000k/kg. Place is spacious and clean, with daily housekeeping. If you're lazy, grabfood is also a convenient option which we had almost daily."
"hotel rooms according to your needs, comfortable and soft beds, clean and fragrant towels, kitchen sheets, refrigerators and soap and shampoo available, getting breakfast is an additional value, but lacking in keeping the dirty and smelly foot mat clean, the wifi network has  problem, there's no cabel tv, the rest is fun"
Cheap but I wouldn’t stay again. Spend a bit more on a hotel - not apartment. I think there was mould on my sheets. No shower screen so the entire bathroom gets soaked. But it was cheap. Staff friendly
"We only stayed for less than 10hrs, just to sleep and move on next morning. But the aircon sucks, too warm. The door not able to lock no matter what we tried. Had to sleep with the door unlocked."
"The room is very convenience as they provide all the necessities in basic studio room. If you like a quiet place compared to noisy center Kuta, this place is very suitable for you other than Seminyak. They also provide packed breakfast so just in case you have very tight schedule in the early morning, you can just have it on the go."
I love you mba asti
Dont hier a moterbike from hotel this is so ambercing the moter bike owner abuse me and shameless wording  only staff was helpful
Nice place to stay. Thank you
"The hotel is clean and comfort, the staffs are super friendly"
"We had a pleasant stay! i stayed for 4 nights, on my first night my pillowcase smell so bad , so the next day i requested them to change room for me. they manage to change for me.
Staff are friendly
breakfast is provided"
"They offer great service to us as we contacted the property due to our late arrival in the midnight, the property replied to our message efficiently and arrange a late check in for us. The room equipped with a small kitchen and other basic facilities. Besides that, breakfast was sent to the room in the morning. The overall experience is satisfying."
