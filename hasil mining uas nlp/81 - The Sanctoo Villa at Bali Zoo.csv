"Got upgraded to pool access room, and thankful for that since we travel with 1 toddler and 1 baby. Room is clean and spacious, everything works well. Not very big but nice swimming pool. You can go to bali zoo with unlimited free access but you have to take the ticket in receptionist. They informed us to take the shuttle bus from kampung sumatra to the main zoo. Later on the last day a guy in the main zoo show us the very near short cut entry from sanctoo to main zoo. Had we know it earlier sure will save much time and energy. The food from restaurant is delicious, you could dine in resto or order in to your room. On breakfast we ask for baby chair but they only have 1 chair and already used. I guess they sould have more thinking of almost all of the guest are traveling with kids. 
I suggest to prebook the activity in zoo, like elephant ride, by the receptionist. We got 30% off. One thing that disappoint me is the free photo session. They dont informed us the detail, just saying that we have free photo session benefit. So we set the schedule. Only after the photo session end, the photographer took out the package option if we want to take the soft copy of our photo and the free benefit is just 1 photo in soft copy. Mannn…i’m mocked.     Better ask the detail of everything previously."
"Its perfect for holiday with young kids. Its located beside the Bali Zoo, we just walk to the Zoo.
Amazing Villa No. 10, Amazing Room, Bathroom, Pool and located beside river (the sound of the river - makes it perfect).
Bathroom is amazing clean and luxury.
PERFECT WITH FAMILY WOTH YOUNG KIDS."
"The view  in every corner is amazing, friendly staff with fast response, everything is clean and tidy , we stayed for one week and it was amazing. 
The pool is so clean and warm , it is refreshing even to just set. 
The spa is very good too, private room with waterfall view and calm environment with nature sounds, they respect you privacy and ask where u don't want to be touched.
They pay attention to the details very well. 
The only problem is ants but this cannot be handle as you are in jungle 😁 and they still do their best to get rid of them. 
Great vacation there"
"We arrived at the hotel late in the evening, actually we book the suites room for 2 days,  but the front liner officer told us, that we've got free room upgrade into villa with private pool, what a wonderful surprise. the villa itself was stunning with spacious room, wardrobe area & luxury bathroom. The upgrade suppose to be only for 1 night, but they're helping us so that we can extend our next-day booked in the villa too. So far this is the most pleasant hotel during our family holiday in Bali. Thank you Sanctoo and definitely would go back there in the upcoming visit to Bali."
"Loved staying here! 
We stayed for 2 nights and it was a lovely stay. 
The room we stayed in was spacious and clean, the bed and couch were comfy to lay about on, the bathroom was huge.
The staff are so friendly and accommodating. 
Pool was great for my 3 year old it has a shallow side and a deep side for which is great.
Buffet breakfast was delicious lots of choices to choose from.
The location is great the zoo is just behind sanctoo you can walk if you like it’s that close.
Would definitely stay here again if we ever needed accommodation out in Ubud!!"
"I think it’s the best value in Ubud. The hotel room is big enough for 2 adults and one child. My daughter slept on the sofa bed. The best thing staying in Sanctoo is we can still visit zoo on the next morning, enjoy the playground in the zoo.  Highly recommend this hotel to everyone!"
"we are family with 2 kids, when we booked thru agoda, it asked us to add an extra bed, but it's all worth it. the room itself was pretty spacious, very clean, there's hand sanitizer available in the room and free masks too! love the bathroom-nice ambiance, especially the soap (smells really good, like the one usually used for Balinese spas, having jasmine or aromatherapy kind of).. then we love the pool as well! some more, they will offer you a family picture taken by a pro photographer! which of cos, will be a super memorable gift you can bring home.. :) the price is incl.  an entry visit to the bali zoo for 4 of us, which is awesome! highly recommended hotel for all of you!"
"Stayed 2 nights. Great hotel right next to the zoo. Beautiful pool. Suites are so big. 
Breakfast average. Food in restaurant average and cold. 
Building work going on to extend restaurant, but didn’t worry us 10 am to 5 pm. Booked breakfast with the orangutans which was amazing and got 30 percent discount through booking with hotel. 
Found a lovely restaurant and mini mart 5 mins walk from hotel. 
Would highly recommend this hotel if you are planning on going to the zoo."
"Enjoyed our 3 days 2 nights stay tremendously. The stay included a free pass to the zoo and I highly recommend to upgrade the breakfast to the one at the zoo with the animals which include elephants, orang utans and other cute animals. My children enjoyed the experience greatly. We stayed in a villa with a private pool. Villa was huge and kept clean. Staff is incredibly polite and payltient."
"Staff unbelievably helpfull, even went to the shop and picked up a packet of ciggies for me, made me and my girlfriend feel very comfortable and safe, with the free zoo ticket made a lovely day, and the elephant mud fun was fantastic experience which was made very safe, animals well looked after unlike some other countries
Would recommend to all my friends visiting bali"
"Stay for 3 nights and all of the staff were helpfull and give usefull advise.
Menu of restaurant were limited.
Breakfast was good and healthy.
I have free access to the zoo anytime and got free photo for souvenir.
I will be back in the future."
"We stayed 2 nights at garden view villa with pool, the room was so gorgeous, spacious, clean and comfortable. All the were attentive, friendly and fast responded to our need. We will definitely back to Sanctoo next time👍👍"
"Receptionist during my stay was great! She will call you by your name during your stay! She can memorize all the guest during the stay! Great hotel too! You can access the zoo with a free pass! 
Great accomodation!"
"I would love to recommend everyone with kids to stay with Sanctoo. Not only for its location that’s adjacent to Bali Zoo, but also what I love the most is the helpful and super friendly staff. They really treat visitor very well. We also got free photoshoot session, the result is amazing! Thank you for the hospitality, Sanctoo"
Best staycation ever. Glas we choose this hotel as our stay in Ubud. The staff are very nice and they offerred excellent service. One of the best experienced I had here. Excellent hospitality!
"Sanctoo is a great choice if you’re planning to go to Bali Zoo, especially to those who have kids.
It’s really close to Bali Zoo, you can even walk there for less than 5 mins. 
the hotel itself does not offer much facilities, other than a nice pool, however you are free to go back and forth to Bali Zoo anytime you like during your stay.
anyways, staffs were outstanding. especially the  restaurant team (the woman from the restaurant on our first and second day was very nice and helpful)."
The staff was welcoming and wonderful from the guard and the reception actually the reception was outstanding they upgraded our room because it’s our honeymoon to a Villa and they were nice all the way I will definitely stay there again .
"The breakfast was delicious and full of variety, the food was excellent everytime you order, especially the local food.
The hotel room was very spacious and always clean,  also the furniture was well made.
The amenities were really helpful .
The staff was extremely helpfull, friendly and always ready to help
The emplacement is very good you are close to a lot of services and stores as well as sanctoo zoo.
The hotel offers you the possibility to book actiboties of you desire."
"Sanctoo is a great place to stay for a solo traveller, couple of family. The rooms are clean and fresh with good facilities within the hotel. The pool is large and a great place to relax."
A perfect place to stay escpecially if you plan to visit Bali Zoo. You will get complementary tickets and the zoo is walking just next to the hotel. We had a great time during our stay 👍
"The room so spacious, comfortable, my family really enjoyed stayed in sanctoo. Really recommend if you want to visit bali zoo, just the next door from bali zoo."
"We often visit Bali and usually stay either around Ubud centre or beach area. Although this is not that far from Ubud centre (in Gianyar area),  it also has the serenity and green lush ambience.
We're traveling with kid who will spend his most day at the zoo and yes, we'll get a free unlimited entry to the zoo when staying in this hotel.
Green lush trees, peaceful villa and rooms is their signature. But, the best part is their spa, it's reasonably affordable but the service is a 5 star. Massage is great and one of a kind and the spa facing the river and the nature, o my goodness!!!"
"The place is clean, the room even the cheapest one is spacious and complete. Worth the money! Also you will get free unlimited access to Bali Zoo."
"Kamar luas dan bersih, cocok untuk family. Kamar mandi terutama bagus banget, luas, lengkap. Will definitely come visit again."
"2 min walk from zoo 
Great elephant mud activity 
Nice shallow pool 
Good breakfast 
Reasonable price 
We had adjoining rooms"
Nice and clean room with super friendly staff.
"The other side of Bali which is also amazing. This place is a magnificent retreat for you and your family to enjoy. The zoo is a fun place to go with your kids. The staffs are all very nice and helpful. If you happen to stay in the villa, that was a very beautiful place to spend the night in. I will certainly come back again."
I would definitely recommend this hotel. The location is quiet and peaceful. Many thanks to all the staff for their wonderful service and attitude toward us.
"very good service and polite, helpful, environment very good too"
"Probably the most impresive Hotel that i've ever stayed in my whole life. Breakfast good, Bed is big, CLean, all time free pass to Bali zoo (kid likes it verymuch). Free photo session 15mins. Excellent!!"
"I cannot express enough how much we enjoyed our stay at Sanctoo.  The room was spacious and clean, the bathroom was massive and the staff were fantastic."
"Wonderful place,close the nature,the staff was pretty good and friendly.Me and my girlfriend recommend for anyone that think to stay in Sanctoo. 🙌🏻🙌🏻"
"Hotel restaurant is small and provide limited choices for breakfast. However, food price is reasonable. Room is big with a tub in the bathroom and an attached terrace. However, an incident happened during my stay when I went to bed. Some lights flashed through my curtains from the terrace and when I checked it out, nothing there outside. And after I checked, it stopped happening. It made me feel a bit unsafe and there isn't bolt in the room."
"Can enter Bali Zoo anytime and enjoy the zoo, the private pool in the villa is good and we truly enjoy our stay."
"Room is spacious, foods is delicious and quite affordable. There's a Bali Zoo which my kids quite like it, especially it has shuttle between the two sites. My kids  also enjoyed the ice cream gelato."
"We really love this Hotel. For the hotel rooms, the ambience, the facilities, the foods ,EVERYTHING! 
Good value for money.  
The staff is the most amazing part about this property. Everyone is consistently SUPER HELPFUL."
"We love the place very much. The kids were happy with easy round the clock access to the zoo, breakfast with orang utan and the pool. Dining experience was pleasant. Service was outstanding!! Thank you. The spa is so relaxing. We will come back during school holiday."
"Best hospitality, very nice room and facility, very relaxing spa with tranquility, unlimited access to zoo, free photo session with professional photographer, nice romantic dinner, we’re very happy to stay here and would love to go back. highly recommend!"
"great service, cheap but superb food, very close to the zoo, convenient for the family with a baby or a kid. The resident of this hotel can get exclusively discount for breakfast with orangutans. Awesome experience! Cannot miss it!"
Happy with our 1 night stay at the resorts
Best place to stay for visiting the zoo. Very clean and comfortable. Great staff. Big room with soft comfortable bed.
"Lokasi strategis, Bersih & All staff are friendy. Thank you sanctoo"
I loved the kind and helpful nature of every staff from receptionist to housekeeping. Would highly recommend
"Very clean room, friendly staff and good breakfast, a good place to stay and enjoying the pool"
"Nice place with great Staffs. Location is still good for those looking to be close to the zoo but not considered the central of Ubud. Room is nice and staff manage to keep clean however many small ants in the room regardless of maintaining the cleanliness. Nice to walk, fabulous spa with great price and awesome bonuses for staying with them such as free zoo admission, breakfast included... recommended for anyone who are okay to be a bit away from Central Ubud and not worry about the ants."
"Whole place was amazing, highly recommend all the animal activities. Value for money was amazing thank you"
We can go to the bali zoo for free
"Spacious and comfy room, great facilities, friendly and helpful staff…"
"Right at the zoo! 
Good rooms.. Conpact resort!"
Location near Bali zoo just steps away. Villa with private pool just nice. Simple breakfast but OK
"Stayed at Sanctoo for 4 nights, 5 days. Probably the best luxury stay I have had so far. The staff is extremely supportive, gracious and nice. Especially appreciate their help in cooking vegetarian dishes off the menu. Totally loved the ambience, the comfort and luxury that Sanctoo offers."
"A good property for relaxation, with excellent staff services. Not far away from city center but  once you are here, it is far from the crowds."
"You'll love it! Clean, beautiful, good food, walking distance to zoo!!"
They gave best service with all the activities inside the hotel
Thank you for your hospitality sanctoo team really wanna see you soon
All segment perfect for your family
"Location, staff, facilities are superb"
"I would give more than 5 stars if possible. Enjoyed everything from Sanctoo, thanks to Bu Julie and team for the excellent hospitality."
"After visiting various natural scenery in Bali, we brought our kid to this hotel. The location is really fantastic. Great value for money and free entry to the zoo each day Great value for money and free entry to the zoo each day and was just a short walk away. It only takes 3-5min to walk to the zoo. 
Great resort."
"+ Nice view, very well cleanliness, spacious room, very good and friendly service, xtra 20% disc for sanctoo spa and it was amazing treatment and the view of spa, free photo w/ photographer, booking 4 room and close by also request for best view and connecting room and they accepted it was so nice, free entry for bali zoo.
- Extra 100k for child above 6yo, but the variety of food is very disappointing, the taste and variety is not worth it for that price."
"Staffs are the best, so helpful throughout our stay. They even included my 7-year old in the special Independence Day celebration. The zoo visits was also a higlight for my daughter. Would definitely reccomended for family with young children."
"Beautiful , peaceful place to stay at. Wonderful staff and lovely rooms"
"It is a nice Hotel for us with young children because located beside the zoo and got a free entry ticket.  In the zoo, we can give food to crocodiles, elephants, and tigers. Nice experiences for us and our children."
Only thing I can pick out is the sliding doors have a gap but we asked for a lot of Mosquito repellent the auto ones in the outlets. Breakfast and the restaurant was rather disappointing food wise. But I would come back for a romantic and relaxing stay.
Situated inside the zoo is a very good option for family with children
"My sons really enjoy the stay, all good, staffs, facility, cleanness, rooms, only one thing. Maybe the breakfast variant could be make it more complete. That's all, will come back when my second son can walk 😄 Thank you so much Sanctoo"
"I would recommend staying here for a family with young children. The Zoo is right next door. It's clean, so many activities at the zoo and we got free daily passes when staying at the hotel."
"Comfort room, definitely will back again to sanctoo."
"Staff very friendly, facilities and food still good"
"Clean, spacious rooms. Friendly staff. Free Bali zoo tickets. Will come back."
Spacious room with a nice view. Value for money.
"(+) Overall, our stay was comfortable. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Housekeeping was great - it is nice to go back to a clean room after a full day of activities. Breakfast spread was decent as well.
(-) Location-wise, it is about 20 minutes away from  Ubud city center - travelling to and fro daily into the central area for dinner can be quite a hassle (traffic can be quite bad). On the flip side, we kinda liked that the location provides a quieter environment... so this is pretty subjective. The plumbing system for the sink needs major reworks - it gets flooded easily. Lastly, we requested for airport transfer services and were not informed that a slight detour would incur additional charges. If we were to grab/gojek ourselves to the places, it would have been cheaper than what the hotel charged us."
Lovely resort with lovely staffs! Really worth it with the price you pay. Room is also very good! Nice!
"It was really nice well maintained. I think the staff were overly eager to help since we were their first tourists since Covid. 
Either would recommend."
"My overall experience at Sanctoo Suites was very pleasant, especially since I brought my nephew along. This family-friendly property is a great choice for relaxing as it is located in a quiet area, that away from the noisy tourist zones. The staffs on duty readily helped us and I was very impressed for their hospitality. It was a sweet gesture when they gave us a birthday surprise during our stay there. Additionally, their in-house guests also get free access to the Bali Zoo, which would certainly be an interesting experience for children. If there are things that need to be improved, I think they need to add choices to the breakfast menu (although, I did realised that the COVID-19 pandemic situation has contributed to this policy). However, I can conclude that I really enjoyed my short staycation there, and I would definitely recommend Sanctoo Suites."
I wrote a long review but this site had errors and it was lost. Not doing it again - sorry.
"The hotel itself was clean and tidy, well kept and had a nice pool. It’s good value for money considering you have the zoo next door. The staff were friendly and accomodating. Very basic breakfast options. Good for a family with young kids considering it’s next to the zoo.
It was nice to get a discount on the elephant mud experience as a guest of the hotel but they get you with the photos by charging $150AUD to put your photos on a USB on top
Of the $100AUD discounted admission."
Their staff and service are amazing! Far from everywhere except the zoo but we had a really good time there
"Should have ur own vehicle if wanna stay here. Because bit far from everywhere (can't by walk) But the ppace so nice. The swimming pool even not cold the water, good for me to dip in. But so baf the zoo actually not much animals. But i can see the animals super healthy."
Love this property 5 stars my kids love this and also we love this 10/10
Beautiful place .. Totally worth it!!
Staff very friendly and welcome. Room is big and clean. 2 mins walk to Bali zoo. Can hear animal in the morning and during the day. Highly recommended for families with kids.
Very peacefull
Excellent customer service
"You get 2 free entry to the zoo. Room is clean, staffs are friendly, but breakfast needs more work done."
"Hotel ambience was calm and soothing. Staff were extremely hospitable and friendly. Facilities at the hotel was complete. I stayed at the 1 bedroom river view villa. Although there is no view of the river, I can hear the crashing sounds of the river. ;D Will definitely return and recommend this hotel to my friends and families. Thank youuu
Best,
Yvette Febrina"
"Nginep disini Free tiket Bali Zoo 2 hari, kamar luas dan bersih, ada bathtube, recomended"

Very Good hôtel
Amazing stay. They even give us complimentary photo session. Nice place to stay for family with young children
Room was awesome and staff was very helpfull.

"thankyou for the best hospitality, great service, complete facilities, clean, comfort, staff so friendly, thankyou for make my staycation perfect"
In-house transport us very expensive
clean and good👍
"Nice stay, direct access to the zoo, 
Very fun"
"I had a pleasant experience staying at Sanctoo. I stayed  at the villa, the room is big, nice pool and super bathroom.. really big. 
I stayed with my 2 toddlers, it’s just 2min walking distance to the zoo. So our daily routine was like pool, bathtub, zoo and repeat. And yes, staffs are really friendly and helpful and nice. Thank you for the hospitality. 
The only thing is, for family stay, the villa could use more lighting. And I wished the resort have kids club. Would be perfect."
"Nice place to stay with young children, because it's near to the zoo"
"If you love visiting zoo, then this is the right hotel for you!"
"Stayed there on the weekend that it was a bit packed. Some of the families with children chose to swim at the same time made the pool a bit too crowded.
Other than that, we loved our stay at the Sanctoo."
"I’m staying over for 2 nights and it’s on my mom’s bday, I initially asked for birthday arrangement through chat, and they mentioned free cake only, but on the day, they went beyond, decorating the bed with flowers and cute little towel animals.
The staff is very polite and trying to accomodate to your needs and questions. They’re also very friendly and it feels genuine.
I’m happy with this visit and it’s memorable stay indeed.
Thank you all sanctoo staff"

"The hospitality was great. The staffs are also nice & kind. I was stayed in the villa, everything was ok. Nothing to complain at all. 
Surely will come back next time.
Thank you so much!"
Bali zoo is the highlight of the property .. staff is very helpful
Good hospitality !
"- staff nya ramah2
- happy banget bs ke zoo unlimited 
- Breakfast standard
- Bed dan daybed terlalu empuk
So far so good :)
Thank you"
"Loved how modern the rooms were and the friendly staff at the restaurant.
However breakfast was very disappointing with little options reminding me of a bed and breakfast rather than an expensive stay. Bread was frequently finished with staff only replacing once a guest informed them. Would have preferred having breakfast elsewhere."
"Best villa i ever stay 👍🏻
Pelayanan yg ramah & helpfull, breakfast jg beragam dgn rasa yg enak. Protokol kesehatan selalu diterapkan, tdk perlu khawatir membawa anan” staycation dikala pandemi"
"I like how the hotel does follow the health protocol especially during breakfast.
Room is clean. Its located next to Bali zoo with just 3 minutes walking distance. The spa is amazing, good value for money, relax while enjoying the sound of waterfalls"
"Value for money if you're with children and looking to go to bali zoo.
Staff are very friendly and accomodating
Food prices are reasonable"
It's fun next to bali zoo....
The property is awesome and when you are kid the access to zoo is like so easy and fast and stay at the hotel has free access to zoo is very comforting
"Its well maintained new clean hotel. Staff is great and I recommend to take morning walk, had a great conversation alongside. However, there is nothing next to hotel, closest cafe was 15 min driving. Zoo was not impressive. Its a great hotel for families"
"We were stayed in Villa by river. If you feel comfortable with river sound during the whole staying pls book this type of villa, otherwise, pls don’t. The river sound quite loud. All of the staff very awesome and friendly. Always smile and helpful. I just feel not comfortable with the lighthing in bathroom and villa. it’s quite dark. The rest, no issue. I’m very happy with my stay."
"We had a lovely stay at Sanctoo in the river view villa. Free access to the zoo was amazing!
We also did the orangutan breakfast and elephant experience which were amazing.
Would definitely stay again"
"The room was beautiful but for the money, I have stayed in just as nice for half the price. The price is high up to the proximity to the zoo. But menu is expensive for room service and any extras. I had breakfast with the orAngutans. Was ok but not allowed to touch or really go near any of the animals and food was ok. I have previously stayed at the Bali wildlife villas and would definitely recommend over sanctoo. Zoo was fairly small."
"We have stayed at several villas over the years. These particular villas are amazing. Plenty of room inside and out!
Would prob recommend a 2 night stay min just to unwind and enjoy. 
Fees also include entry into the the zoo.
The zoo atm is not very big but extensions have begun and should be better with more animals in the near future. Souvenirs and food is quite expensive."
Spend 2 nights here very worth the value. Location right next to bali zoo and area in middle ubud and denpasar so can still order online food not so far from both area
