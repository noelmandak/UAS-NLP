"The whole hotel/villa was very artistic from the hotel to the rooms, it was designed by a very good architect. The staff was very attentive, professional and friendly. Breakfast and dinner menu was AWESOME, it’s better than some restaurants in Ubud. They even provided room service for breakfast and packed our food on days we have to leave earlier. They have a Harman Kardon speaker in the room which we enjoyed very much. 
For this price of $70/night, I think it’s equivalent of a 6 star hotel. Our stay was impeccably comfortable we will be back without a doubt! Thank you for making our stay so great!"
"We stay for 2 nights in this beautiful design hotel, it’s said by the staff that this hotel is designed by the same designer from Desa Potato Head. Great service, clean room, great ambience. The only constructed criticism is for breakfast, I think the food flavour for the main dish, can be elevated a little more, but all love for the hotel."
"I highly recommend Titik Dua.
I can tell this is an artwork:)
Also there foods are high quality.
I would love to stay Titik Dua  again!
I wanted to tell their staff that I really appriciated :)
Thank you for making my trip wonderful!"
"What a memorable experience staying at Titik Dua Ubud! Aesthetically pleasing, every corner of the place is instagrammable. Every tiny little detail of the place is well thought and well executed. As someone who values great branding and architecture design, I am lost for words to describe how pleasant, enjoyable, and fulfilled my experience staying at Titik Dua has been. Will def come to this place again whenever I am in Ubud. Keep up the good work!"
"1st. Its made by my favorite architect Pak Andramatin. This was my reason to stay.
2nd. Its not only an instagramable hotel, but the touch the service is very personal. 
3rd. Underestimate for the breakfast, its not buffet, but its really yummy! The presentation the food it self, really great. Im a bit upset with the time to serve, however the surrounding of the hotel worth 💙 surely will come back"
"i dont typically give reviews and also recommend people hotels to stay. but this one is an exception.
used to hear that the main spotlight of the place is the architecture and minimalist interior. but you guys should come and experience the hospitality of the titik dua team, and also how comfortable it is staying here. 
one of the best stay ive had in years."
"We had the best time here during our visit to Ubud! The staff were super sweet and they surprised me on my birthday with the loveliest cake and flowers, and both my husband and I really enjoyed our stay. We love the overall vibe of the room and the hotel, the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff, the wonderful breakfast, the chill pool, and basically everything! We surely will stay here again the next time we visit Bali :)"
"I recommend this hotel to everyone. It exceeds expectations.
Pros: excellent staff, thoughtful design, tasty (vegetarian-friendly) food, low-waste water and coffee refill system, affordable laundry service, cleanliness, peaceful atmosphere within Ubud.
Cons: construction and other noise can be distracting during the day, the entry and exit path is long."
This hotel is superb! We enjoyed our 2 nights stay in this hotel. I really love the interiors and the building itself. It's very quiet and you can totally relax on your vacation. Easily accessible by Grab/Gojek. Staff are friendly. Surprised that the Breakfast was very good also! We regret that we missed the breakfast on our 2nd day since we were out for a tour. I wish we could have eaten tho but overall very nice hotel!
"Spent 2 nights of our honeymoon in Bali at Titik Dua Ubud! It was love at first sight when we saw the beautiful architecture of the building, with lots of greenery and open space. The room was also really cozy, we love the little details like the nice Sony Tv where we can watch Netflix, and the Harman Kardon speaker, comfy bed and high tech toilet.  Also, we love the breakfast and dinner, delicious food at the restaurant by the pool. Overall, really satisfied and definitely recommended! ☺️"
"This hotel is gorgeous. From the walkway that takes you to the hotel lobby, the unique lift, interesting doors, and amenities, it's a lovely place to be. Super zen. Super peaceful and away from the busy roads of Ubud.
The staff was super helpful. Shoutout to Era for checking us in, and Anggung for checking us out at 4am in the morning. For someone who hates picking up the phone to make calls, I am a big fan of their room service system where communication is done via Whatsapp. Their replies are prompt and they get you what you need in an instant. If there's one thing to call out, you do hear a bit of noise from neighbouring rooms– especially when someone in the next room showers. It's nothing disruptive, just a small thing to note.
Do try the food at the restaurant too. The steak was delicious. The Beef Ribs Belado was also to die for. Superb service too. 
I'll definitely come back to this place in the future. It's a shame that the restaurant on the 3rd floor wasn't open during our stay. Looking forward to its opening!"
"Loving this architectural hotel to bits, the door to the room itself is sleek and fancy, super love. 
The breakfast were excellent and the Bluetooth speaker in each room is super thoughtful. Would love to stay here everyday 💕"
"Gorgeous rooms, modern, clean . Beautiful staff who couldn’t do enough for you. Especially Agung ❤️ Pool area divine and so quiet with only 22 rooms. Restaurant great even vegan options for us . Definitely recommend"
"I went there with my family, and we really loved it!! The staff were amazing and so kind and helpfull. Will recommend this place to everyone 🙏"
"You will be wow-ed by its aesthetically designs. Its everything.
The bed is comfortable. The shower as well, the toilet is using Japanese kind bidet, love.
The breakfast is nice. The staff is awesome."
It’s a very chic boutique hotel. You can feel they care about every detail. The room size is a bit small but perfect for solo traveler. Not to mention their good value and fantastic service.  I love their in room filter coffee kit. Would definitely recommend it!
"Nice clean creative hotel. Very quiet and relaxed, friendly staffs. I would recommand this place"
"The hotel was exquisite -- impeccably clean rooms with chic design and details, helpful staff and professional management, delicious food, tranquil environment, and a funky cool art gallery! I loved everything and highly recommend staying here."
"The modern design and architecture are exceptional, every corners are eye-pleasing. Spacious room and great amenities, there’s even a Harman-Kardon speaker inside. Breakfast are delicious (I recommend the Nasi Uduk). Wish we could stay longer, will come back for another visit!"
"We loved staying here. İt is interesting and so very comfortable. The staff were excellent, yummy breakfast with local options and good espresso. 
Using WhatsApp to communicate was great to as we could ask questions even when not on site. I really enjoyed this modern take, even though I usually go fir more traditional looking hotels. 
Memorable."
"Best hotel we ever stayed at, such helpfull staff and clean rooms !"
"The hotel is cozy and the right size to just rest, relax by the pool and read. Modern style hotel but warm atmosphere.  Big comfy bed, good breakfast, and amazing staff; all at reasonable price.  Will always come back here when in Ubud"
Service is lovely. The space is wonderful. Just walk around to see the different angles and light. The food was very good and had a great range of options. Loved my breakfast every morning. Try sitting by the pool or in front of the bar or at the table behind the sunbeds. The products they use in the hotel are also lovely. Great scents. Would definitely go back. The only thing is that I wish there was a little path around the stream down past the pool for walking with a coffee in the morning.
"As this my first time solo travel to Ubud, I had an exceptional experience stay here! Thank you"
"Love the ambience, feels like in private hotel. Suitable for chilling & relaxing. Love this place ❤️"
"Best architecture design, helpful and friendly staff, good breakfast food quality. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. We will repeat the stay"
This hotel is new & very high tech. The room isnt big but enough for couple. Also very clean. The amenities also used premium ingredient. We love everything about titik dua ubud. Thank you titik dua
"all staff greet with smile and very helpful. The breakfast also nice, and located on the main street and near to every hype place in Ubud, but quiet at the same time. The plus point, there's an art exhibition during my stay. Minus point, the elevator seems need a proper one."
"The property has a very nice design. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room is perfect for 2, not too big nor small. Will visit again!"
"the location is very near with makbeng ubud, around 20-30min to ubud centre. Love the architrctural of this hotel, the elevator and room door is unique. The breakfast also taste so good. Highly recomended for those who loves to take  picture lots of beautiful spot."
Clean n very owsome hotel
"new hotel everything is fancy and new, breakfast was delicious, nature is great, staff is so helpful."
"We like the quitness, design, and the food also fantastic. We really had a great time while stay ini titik dua. Every corner is nice touch from the designer."
Very Art and modern hotel. The staff very helpful and the food very yummy
"Pros : unique door, modern room, nice bathroom, sony tv with netflix and spotify, helpful staff via whatsapp and face to face
Cons : front of the hotel is a bit dark at night (a bit hard to find if you come back at night)
All in all, i would definitely come back to Titik Dua if i come to Ubud again 😁"
Unique and good place
"Great hotel! The architecture is absolutely beautiful and the food is great. Very close to Ubud centre as well so it’s very convenient. Certain design in the room do not make sense, but not a deal breaker."
"Well designed hotel! We love the atmosphere of the place, very much comfortable and clean. Friendly staffs and good hospitality. Overall, thank you for being a good example of well designed hotel. We surely will come back again."
Very Clean and modernize!
"The best bathroom experience!
They have an American-grade toilet bowl with bidet spray and warm temperature control for the seat. I was suffering from food poisoning & diahhrea and this was super timely. The team took great care of me and my meals when I was sick. Loved the timely communication through Whatsapp. We even coordinated an ambulance pick-up to the nearest 24hrs clinic. They have a really cool roofless lift as well. 
Located beside the forest, there are inevitably tons of mosquitoes by the pool. Everyone in the different areas was clapping & smacking for the mosquitoes in unison.
Best to dine and drink in the room. However, the wooden table & chair in the room are not comfortable."
"Not your typical balinese hotel. Titik Dua's design, decor and amenities is very Japanese inspired. Great hospitality and lovely breakfast options.  A couple more amenities in the bathroom would be nice. But all in all a great stay. Definitely recommend."
"One of the hidden gem in Ubud, with the modern architecture and unique experience of staying in one place"
"Nested in a quiet place, very nice architecture , new rooms and good amenities"
Small hotel but its worth the money. Staffs were super. Bfast were excellent.
Designer hotel. Modern . New. I live it.
"semi private hotel, not crowded with only 18 room
good service
you must try the restaurant food especially Seafood risoto is the best"
"I can not fault the hotel at all. The service is amazing, the staff are friendly and the room is beautiful. A little tucked away from the city Center but the outlook semi jungle is amazing. I would recommend getting a scooter if you want some hustle and bustle but the tranquility of this place is what I was looking for."
"Nice view and compact room for solo traveler, I think if it’s for 2 person the room is prettu small. But I like the hotel concept and design"
"Had a wonderfully week at Bali! 
First stay at Ubud at the cool boutique hotel Titik Dua, interesting architecturally,  build behind an art gallery, guests have to go up and into a 45m-long, high bridge to reach the lobby. 
Love the drip coffee in the room, bed was comfortable, staff were helpful and cheerful, small selection of breakfast items but delicious. Great value for money."
Very close to some favorite places for meals.
100% recommended
"All was good, but the lackness is few of the menu of the breakfast is sold out everyday."
Great great hotel! Super chill!
"clean, good service, good breakfast and best pool !"
"Bathroom is really clean. If Aesop opens a hotel, I guess this is it. Sounds from the nature may be pretty loud for some, but that's the beauty of this place since it's situated near the forest."
"I really enjoyed my stay here, the hotel design was so unique, the room was good, the staff were so friendly, the breakfast was also good, fast check in and we could communicate with the staff by whatsapp. The only down things is the internet and the tv channel, i hope the internet and the tv channel could be improved."
Staff and hotel deisgn are execelent! Will be nice if they have a gym
Very love the design
"Rất đẹp, độc lạ"
"We stayed 2 nights at Titik Dua.
Love the architectural & interior design of this hotel! All the details & sequence starting from the drop off, the bridge, the lobby, corridor, the room & pool view are stunning!
The breakfast was ok and the staff are very helpful and friendly."
Love the industrial minimalist interior. Room is very clean
It's nice place to have a cozy vacation with family.
"Went here during my bday month…. Very friendly staff, received a lovely bouquet n bday cake. Food also good, i love the room service n their oxtail soup and fried rice"
"Luv the minimalist design, friendly staff"
"Staff deserves 6 stars. The architecture is stunning, great place for a short getaway. Oh and the breakfast and dinner was fantastic!"
A nice hotel but not recommended for elder and family with young children (IMHO)
Look I got sick when I was there and they really were so nice and helpful but 1. If you're going to use the pool you'll have an audience of non pool people just eating because the restaurant is under construction. 2. The bugs in the trees are so loud they're deafening didn't have a moment of peace. 3. The location makes it difficult for walking and it's far from the city center
Hotel nya nyaman pelayanan ok
"It’s like combining high tech in ubud lush nature. Stay in ubud with style. The minus only the communication with whatsapp when we need anything. I think it’s more convenient to call. And theres no trash bin inside the room. Other than that, everything was perfect."
"Super good deal! Nice place, nice service, nice location. Aesthetic room"
A true oasis of perfection and relaxation  in the overwhelm of ubud
We had a lovely stay at Titik Dua! The staff is incredible! They exceed our expectations! I definitely recommend this hotel!
Enjoy my stay here.
"Loved the architecture and concept of the place! Very serene and classsy, great for couples or female best friends."
"Breakfast great
Staff great
All entire hotel so modern..
Lobby very casual.."
This is close to the city n no problem at all.
New and clean hotel. Close to Ubud Center
It is the best hotel for the price. The hotel interior and clean interior that seemed to be in an art museum were flawless.
Love our stay here. Everything’s perfect!
Good staff with excellent service. I would definitely comeback and recommend to friend. The hotel has unique architecture and not to forget the breakfast also good
"The staff was so kind, helpful and friendly. Really love the ambience of this hotel, so peaceful and feels like home.
Definitely will go back soon!"
"Great hotel, nice room , food was excellent"
"A hotel in Ubud, Bali with amazing architecture. Designed by Indonesia's leading architect Andra Matin. You'll amazed by the building façade and silhouette.
The breakfast is great and yumms. 
 A total of 18 rooms, so the hotel is not crowded and you will have a peace of mind. Coffee and tea in the room are so good too.
Located near convenience store, Indomaret.
The hotel situated not far from Ubud city centre and the staff, Ms Eka will treat you well. With her warm smiles and epic Indonesian hospitality.
Truly a gem. #architecture #ubud #bali"
"Wanted to visit Andra Matin's work, booked a stay at titik dua while I was at Ubud. Comfortable room with great amenities. Comes with breakfast that was amazing as well."
"Comfortable, spacious and clean hotel. Worth the money. Pretty aesthetic. There are small shops nearby and you can get food easily too."
"If you're into minimalist decor then this hotel is for you. I enjoyed the room, the quietness and the services via WhatsApp. The location is a bit further from Ubud Central and not walkable (no sidewalk) so you would need transport."
"Small detail is everywhere 😊😊
Speaker at room. Is bonus 👏👏"
Very clean & unique hotel.
Not the best location but still can walk to Ubud strip. Nice pool. Room is compact but does the job. Staffs are very friendly and nice. Most likely will come back.
"5-star accommodation.
It can be difficult for drivers to find at night, but you can't miss the building with its distinctive hallways.
Beautiful building, cool swimming pool and smiling staff.  What more can one ask?
What's even more surprising is that the hotel’s restaurant is a Michelin Star.
Do try ceviche (and many others also).
The staffs are very efficient, quickly reacting to inquires through WhatsApp."

Perfect!!
Great!
"Volvimos a Titik Dua por segunda vez durante nuestro viaje por Bali ya que salimos muy contentos de nuestra primera estancia. La segunda vez ha sido aún mejor, nos volvieron a tratar igual de bien y mostraron su alegría de volver a tenernos allí. Nos recibieron con un pastel de bienvenida, nos dejaron realizar late check out, nos consiguieron una Scooter (no la conseguimos en ningún rental).... todo genial, siempre con la mejor atención. Volvería a alojarme aquí cada vez q visite Ubud."
Nice place
nice place n design
"Nicht nachdenken, einfach buchen. Das war so ein toller Aufenthalt, ich weiß nicht wo ich anfangen soll. Hier passt einfach alles! Super Essen, tolle Architektur, hochwertige Zimmer, super Personal. Wenn ich wieder nach Ubud kommen sollte, werde ich mit Sicherheit wieder in dieses Hotel kommen!"
"とにかくエントランスからびっくりするくらいの建築アートのホテルです。
交通量の多い街中から一転、とても静かな空間で、客室も、館内もどこを切り取っても美しく美術館にきたようなホテルでした。
一泊の滞在でしたが、朝食は11:00まで、チェックアウトも12:00までなのでとてもゆっくりできます。
館内を回ったり、プールでゆったりしたりとホテル内をゆっくり楽しめました。
私たちが訪れた際は、宿泊している人が少なかったのでとても静かでした。
ただプールからの音は少し響くので、人が多いとうるさいかもしれません。"
整體服務非常好
"신혼여행 첫 숙소로 선택했는데요!
새벽에 도착해도 친절하게 맞이해 주시고 방도 너무 깨끗했습니다! 다음날 바투르 투어도 직접 연결해서 예약해주시고 아침까지 싸서 주시는 좋은 숙소입니다! 발리오면 꼭 이용해보는걸 추천드려요!"
다음에 발리를 오게되면 꼭 묵을겁니다. 위치도 좋고 위생은 발리에서 최고였어요 가격대비 최고!! 디자이너 입장에서 건물 디테일도 너무 마음에 들었습니다. 그리고 위쳇으로 대화하면서 직원들이 세심하게 챙겨주는것도 좋았어요. 특히 밝게 웃어주던 Iyu가 생각나네요 ^^ 행복하세요
"새로운 건축적 공간은 신선했으나 정작 에어컨이 고장나서 거의 밤 12시가 다 된 시간에 방을 옮겨야 했음. 그 과정에서 직원응대가 미숙하였고(시설관리인과 연락이 안 된다는 핑계를 댄다거나, 선풍기를 갖다주겠다거나) 옮긴 방이 호텔 입장에서는 더 상급이긴 했지만 샤워시설이 방 한가운데 노출된 욕조에만 설치되어 있는 등 커플이 아닌 이성친구간에 공유하기에는 부적절하여 불편함이 배가됨"
"머랄까? 이 편안함. 이 안락함.
아쉬운거라곤 욕조가없다는거 말고없다"
한국에 좋은 깔끔 시티호텔인줄알았네요. 정말 이쁘고 좋아요.
늦은저녁에 도착한다면 최고의 위치숙소임
"장2단2 꼽아봤어요
댄항공 새벽도착해서 레이트체크인인데도 너무 친절하고 조식도 포함된 가격이 믿기지않아요
대신 방 크기는 감안해야하고 조명을 다켜도 어두워서 조금 불편쓰 위치는 와안전 가깝지않지만 그래서 조용하고요"
"For this price, you can't get a better hotel. Very modern. Of the 4 days we spent at Ubud, we were the happiest while we stayed at Titik Dua Ubud. 
한국 사람들에게, 
이 호텔 진짜 가성비 갑 입니다. 나중에 발리에 돌아온다면 이 호텔에 다시 가고 싶다는 생각이 들어요! 진짜 깔끔하고 스태프도 정말 친절해요."
"위생상태, 가격, 디자인, 직원들의 서비스 모두 좋았습니다. 또 방문하고 싶습니다"
청결도가 너무 좋고 직원들의 친절함도 너무 좋습니다. 여러 숙소를 이용했는데 티틱두아 숙소는 손에 꼽는 숙소입니당!
다 좋은데 방음 약해요
직원도 친절하고 시설도 매우 좋았다. 조식에서 시켰던 나시고랭은 별로였지만 오믈렛은 맛있었음. 생각보다 벌레도 별로 없고 좋았다
"가격대비 만족도 극상
직원들이 매우 친절함
유일한 단점은 애매한 위치"
지금까지 지내본 호텔 중 최고 였습니다. 강력하게 추천 드립니다.
"건물자체도 예쁘고 룸도 좋아요! 커피랑 티 내려먹을 수 있는데 너무 맛있고, 조식도 진짜 맛있어요!"
"위치는 걸어서 어디 가기엔 좀 애매 하지만, 호텔에만 있기에는 음식도 정말 맛있고 이쁜 호텔이었습니다."
"중심지에서는 살짝 벗어나있지만, 그만큼 조용하고, 신식이라 너무 깨끗하고 쾌적하고 직원들도 너무너무 친절합니다. 아직 사람들이 많이 없어서 붐비지도 않고, 1박만 하는게 아쉬울정도로 좋았어요 :)"
한국인들이 좋아할 호텔 깔끔함 / 뭔가 독특한 호텔 구조 화장실 컨디션도 좋고 다 좋음 / 조식 맛있음 / 우붓 중심가랑은 떨어져있어 택시타고 왔다갔다해야함
"일단 우붓 시내와 거리가 가까운 편은 아니에요. 걸어서 갈 순 있지만 워낙 인도가 제대로 안되어 있다보니 위험하다고 느꼈어요! 그런데 호텔 직원분들의 서비스가 너무 인상적이였어요^_^친절하시고 음식도 너무 맛있었고 부대 시설, 청결도 모두 만족했습니다. 우붓시장은 너무 시끄러웠지만 호텔은 조용하고 힐링 그 자체였습니다!"
조식이 맛났어요. 체크인 체크아웃이 빨랐구요. 호텔 관계자 모든 분들이 친절해요.
"위치:우붓 시내와 걸어서 15분/그랩으로 3-4만 우리나라 기본요금정도
방: 신축 건물이라 전체적으로 깔끔하고 인도네시아 유명한 건축가가 디자인 해서 그런지 매우 세련되었다. 수영장도 굿!!
음식:음식 대체적으로 다 맛있고 특히 시푸드 락사 꼭 드셔보세여(해산물 코코넛 커리)
현재 발리로 사람이 많이 몰리지 않아서 가격이 저렴했지만 정말 깔끔하고 좋았습니다 강추"
