"It was a nice stay, and the staff was absolutly splendid. I also talked to the owner, and it was one of the most insperational talks I have ever had. The values and belifs of this man was something els. Also he is trying to start a orphanage which is so big minded with the largest of hearts. Thanks for the stay"
"The location was amazing, near to everything, there is a supermarket just down the corner, near to food and also the beach. For the price it command I think it is very worth it."
"Enjoy and so relaxing stay here, so good environment with good and very helpful staff who assist and helps alod on our stay with them.  I personally love the views and the service that I received from them. The staff named “Satya” provide the best of best service to us."
I stayed just for 1 night because i wanna go to nusa penida…but the room was just okay for that kind of price! The staff were all so nice
I enjoyed my stay here. The room and swimming pool were outstanding. Thank you to Ms. Kilin and the rest of team for the great hospitality. Keep up good work!
Nice hotel with great location not far from the beach and easy to fid place to eat and also affordable price
"Great hotel for a very reasonable price. I am staying here for 2 weeks and enjoyed very much. Best location in Sanur, and you can find many very good restaurants right next to it. It has a pretty good clean pool. After difficult time during COVID, the hotel is recovering well. Looks like already fully staffed now, and staffs are kind and helpful. Good parking, free refillable drinking water, sizable room, not pricey at all. Highly recommended! I extended two times here. Sanur is also the best town in Bali if you ask most foreigners living here for a long time. I will try to add more photos for it next time."
"This is a great hotel to stay in around Bali. Comfortable, affordable and accessible. Will definitely choose this hotel again when we get back in Bali"
Good location with nice staff and clean enviroment
Staff are friendly and dedicated. Modern facilities with relaxing views and atmosphere.
"I was staying here for only one night, got mad cause my car was stuck and couldn’t go anywhere till another guest move the car, but the staffs was extremely helpful and friendly, thanks"
The hotel is definitely a budget hotel which doesn't make a big hole to your pocket. The hospitality was good. Many good restaurants (including an Indian restaurant) and the breakfast places are in the vicinity.
"The breakfast was really nice and fresh, the view from are room was nice. Best thing about the stay was the proximity to the market and the beach. It was convinient to rent the scooter and the staff was helpful too."
"The staff is nice, and the room is clean. I love staying here."
"We are very happy to stay at Abian Harmony Resort Hotel, excellent cleanliness and very nice view from my room to see outside."
"Friendly and accommodating staff. They are doing some renovations, so one of our rooms was nicer than the other. It felt safe to be there with our two small kids. Would come again."
Choose this hotel if you are looking for a stay without having to count a lot of bucks. Many great restaurants and the breakfast options in the vicinity.
Ideal place for a quick stay before going to Penida Port the next day. Staff was super nice they offered me an upgrade as I booked a super tiny room but I came with my old parents and they wanted my parents to have a better sleep in the deluxe family room. The garden and swimming pool look amazing but we didnt have time to enjoy them. The only downside of the place is that the bathroom amnities seems oxidated by the salty sea water.
Excellent Value
Room air conditioning was the best I’ve had in Bali. Breakfast really nice. Day spa fantastic. Would definitely recommend.
"Staff were friendly, pool had a bar so could order drinks in the water. Rooms were good with balcony overlooking the pool."
"Booked this hotel upon searching nearby area for a good place around Sanur which is affordable yet not too far from jetty (to Nusa Penida). Late check in due to hurdles at Ngurah Rai Airport (2 hours).
Surrounding area was calm and not too busy with tourist (at that time, Sept 2022). Since too much time wasted lining up at the airport, missed my chance to explore the area more.
Upon checked in at around 1800 hrs, told to stay at the lobby while the room prepared. We looked around, and went to the pool situated not too far from the lobby. I'd imagine the area is serene in day time. Room was at first floor, which one had to use a small elevator to get to. The room however, was spacious.
As a party of 3, the bed size and arrangement were good and there's still good chunk of space left. Clean bed, nice interior, fast WiFi... well, what else could we asked for as we're checking out early to head for the jetty.
Location-wise, it's nowhere near good joints to enjoy the night. But you'll surely enjoy the morning when you woke up next day."
"We stayed 2 weeks. The staff were amazing ;friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Lovely pool. Hotel in perfect location, in the middle of shops and restaurants. Spa in hotel also fantastic. Will definitely stay again."
Beautiful grounds with a nice pool. There are many places to relax & enjoy a coffee or read a book. The rooms were large & the bed was comfortable. There are many shops & restaurants within walking distance.
Nice Hotel!!
Lovely place
"staff are exceptionally helpful and polite, rooms always clean, can't beat the price and its in the middle of everything you need in Sanur."
Comfy little place close to everything.  Walked almost everywhere.  Staff was very friendly.
great value
"Pros: 
- Good location, near many interesting places, 
- Our second day room (#107) was clean and comfy.
- Friendly staff and service
- Reliable hot water stream
- Nice pool
Cons:
- Our first day room (#102) was old and moldy. A rain water gutter pipe output was placed directly on top of the room door. So obviously it became a waterfall in front of the room when it was raining.
- The water tasted like greywater."
Clean and comfy
Clean and nice facilities. You get more for what you pay. Recomendable:)
"Abian hotel is well located near minimart, cafes, and restaurants. Quite a vibrant area in Sanur. It provides enough parking space for anout 10 small cars.
Room amenities are very basic and room was clean.  However, this hotel definitely needs room refurbishment. The wing that I stayed in does not have a lift so limited mobility people should ask for the other wing.
Staff were friendly.
It is a good hotel to stay if someone has something to do in Sanur or Denpasar area."
Just stayed for 1 night. Great little place with a nice pool. Basic but fine for a short stay
"Close to the beach, around 5 min walk.  Lots of restaurants nearby. Good option before going to sanur Port the next morning."
"We stayed here for 5 days over the New Year.  For the price this place is in a great spot. Has a good sized pool. Breakfast is adequate to get you started for the day. If you want a buffet or expect lots of different foods then this is not the place for you. The poolside room that we stayed in was  cleaned and cool through out our stay. There were some maintenance issues but once we spoke with staff they got fixed. No big deal. Just ask, they are helpful."
Location is great. Near to everything I needed.
"Got a free upgrade (which is amazing) but every morning there's no water in the room and I need to start my day at 7am every day. The sink is too smelly and every morning there's working guys going on. after 10 days changed the room again but this time the wifi is not working. Every day always hv 1 problem at least. The staff was great! no problem with their attitude, I can see they work hard to explain to the guests about the problems. But I think the manager should the one to blame and take action on this. He/She can't manage the hotel properly."
"Best budget hotel in Sanur. Although towels need changing, not bright white anymore. Looks old. The sheets also smelled like it was sun dried. Pls use fabric conditioner next time. We were out all day anyway so sleeping was okay. Was able to sleep well. Massimo Gelato very near too. Pharmacy and Medical Center very near. Sanur beach better than Kuta, so skip it. Go to the beach and eat at La Playa, the best resto! Was also near a supermarket. Best value for money. Make sure you book it on sale without breakfast, just have breakfast outside, way better. Starbucks is also 2km away, you can ride grab. This hotel still deserves the 8/10 rating."
"Being off beach, it has to be good quality, and it was, and the beach is only a 10 minute walk away mainly down a quiet lane.  I needed it as an economic two-night transit point, and I commonly do this in Sanur but I got better value than previously at other places nearby."
"I came to the hotel so early like 3 am, and the staff so strict to let me check in at 2pm. Another hotel will let me check in even the clock show 11am. Not so kind behaviour but I understand the rules. So i sleep at the lobby instead until 2pm. For the rest,no free breakfast, the room was good, small pool in the center which i think kids gonna love it. Not a good hotel for me but just for rest n sleep, it should be fine."
"Very happy with my stay at Abian, the staff are fantastic and helpful and the place is really serene and peaceful, while within walking distance to the beach and many restaurants and shops. I originally only booked it for two nights but ended up extending my stay twice! 
The room is comfortable with a balcony facing the pool. The pool is mostly idle so it's quiet and peaceful. It was a fantastic escape for me from the Ubud noises. The AC is fantastic, and the staff are just great. Perhaps a minor complaint would be that there is greenish mold (?) on the shower head and handles, and the shower somehow tasted salty. Not a big issue, something I can easily overlook. 
Would definitely stay again if I ever come back to Sanur, thanks for the comfortable experience and hospitality!"
"Hotel is clean. Brekkie was fair, like the american breakfast although the size quite smaller now :D. Close to many café and warung. Walking distance to beach side cafe as well such as Lila Pantai , Nelayan etc."
"Great location for restaurants bars and local shopping.
Very nice pool
Modern rooms
Internet and TV channels better than most"
Peaceful. Good value.  Clean.
Best price with their quality
"Very clean and comfortable room,"
"Abian harmony hotel is a simple hotel. 
Amazing staff and owner very friendly its  central to beach and all eateries.
We had a wonderful time in a deluxe pool room thanks will be back."
Great for a short stay or break. Near ferry terminal.
"Good hotel with amazing potential but sorry very bad maintenace, spa not really nice and damage. buffet miresable and instalations are very broken. Let's hope one day someone take the control of the hotel and will be a  fantastic place...."
"Great if you need a stay close to Sanur port
I went in a group of 3, there was a slight miscommunication and was only provided for 2 pax. The staffs returned with an additional bed, that solved the issue. The next one was the water, it tasted weird when brushing teeth. Hotel provided bottled water, I'd recommend you use it for mouth rinsing."
"The room was comfortable, with a bit of humid smell due to the air conditioning. Rather than that honestly for that price the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Nothing fancy but I wasn’t looking for something fancy. I didn’t use the swimming pool but it’s nice to have it. Staff gentle as usual in Bali"
"Close To great restaurants and short wali to the beach, great for budget travellers!"
"Highlights are the staff and (for the money) location.
Plenty of restaurants in the area. 5 mins walk to the beach.
Pool, due to partial shade, is the perfect temperature.
I dont know why the owners fail on the maintenance side.  Abian needs some TLC and paint.
Avoid the rooms on the street side, which unsurprisingly have traffic noise. I moved to another room after one night. Much better.
A note for management - the volume of the music at the pool could be lower."
"Nice place.
Staff is friendly.
We got a room on top floor with a view towards the street.
Only negative thing is the walls are paper thin, so very noisy."
Hotel is a bit aged
"We stayed at Family Room (1 king size bed & 2 twin beds) for a short stay because we want to go to Nusa Penida early in the morning.
Pros:
- The location, short walking distance to beach, restaurants, mini market
- Although it has small pool, it is decent for kids to swim for short stay
- The room is big
Cons:
- The front office staffs are not that friendly, comparing to majority hotel in Bali.
- There are no sufficient toiletries. You better bring your own."
"The location is very strategic, plenty of shop / cafe / restaurant just step ahead from the hotel. The room its self it's not really clean, the bed sheet that we were slept on got a pen mark, and the shower head were moldy too. Staff were great though."
"- room Cleaning need to be improved on the overall cleanliness. Still has dust.
-Overall good stay."
"The Good
This recommendation goes to the receptionist girl who is still trainee but try to help us bringing our luggage to the room though the senior stopped her with the meaning that is not her job. Thanks to you. Keep up the good work!
(Don't listen to your senior and keep helping)
The Bad
No bell boy. Sorry! help yourself!
To senior receptionist, please don't treat your junior like that and stop that manner in front of the guests!"
Great place to stay great location and very friendly and helpful staff
"This hotel is for budget conscious travellers, clean, adequate and located conveniently for convenience of amenities. Recommended."
"Good location 5minutes walking to beach, friendly and helpful staff, spacious room
Bathroom have unpleasant smell, buildings need improvement (maybe due to covid situation) 
 
My rooms was 4th floor but elevator only goes to 3rd floor so had to use stairs
Awy with great location and great staff is passable"
"My overall stay wasn't really pleasant. There was no warm water, the elevator was not functioning and my room was at 4th floor, which was very tiring to go back and forth. The remote TV wasn't functioning, can't really enjoy the TV. I stayed 2 nights and the second day nobody cleaned my room. Asked for slipper and they say they don't provide slipper, so I had to buy it from nearest minimart because I am a hygiene freak and I can't stand dirty floor. But the price is fairly cheap and location is very good, good restaurants are just walks away. Circle K is just next to the hotel. Overall, you really need to improve the quality your service."
They count by piece not by weight. The tap water is salty. Renovation very needed.Very old hotel.
"Good location, near many restaurant and shops. Room is quite big but not so clean, it felt damp, furniture look old and not good quality. Water drain in bathroom is not good."
"Was probably a good spot 10 years ago. But not now. Great staff trying to prop up an aging hotel.  My big 5..
Location..good
Shower.good
Aircon. Average
Fidge.... there!!!
Tv.. good channels
So it ticks the boxes for a cheapest stay which suits me.
BUT... 
My low 5
Gardens..poor
Rooms..poor to average size and amenities
Rooms..smell of mould. 
Pool..very average size and accessibility 
Ambiance....zero
Value for money... 4 /10
Sorry...the staff are great but out of their control."
Great location.
"They tried to give us a sub standard room first. After we got the room we were supposed to have, I asked to change all the towels, they were badly stained and very old.  We had to flip the mattress as it was so sunken.  We found various items belonging to the previous guests.  The ceiling was a mess.  The bathroom needs attention.  The cleaners need training.
We stayed in room 108."
"Great staff, working in a spartan noisy poorly maintained older hotel. Not that clean !
Skimpy breakfast. Uncomfortable furniture."
Will be back again
"Bathroom shower had bad smell , ac was not working properly    
Apart from that was a nice stay."
I recommend it.
"Not as good as it looks on pictures, bathroom was not really clean, mirror was… well, foggy ! Shower sink was full also !
Some noise for the corridor in late night and early evening. 
Too bad because staff is really nice and helpful, it’s close to the beach and all shops and coffee places. 
Hopefully I booked it with a huge promotion, however I would have asked for a partial refund or an upgraded room…"
"It tries to have a nice garden but doesn't get the harmony part right.  Facilities and rooms badly maintenance and renovation. Some bathroom fixtures are aged and wobbly. Overly strong bidet spray not adjustable due to the tap being seized.  
 The pool has a strong chlorine smell that stays on yoir body. Half of the pool side rooms dont have a porch with chairs. The place is relatively cheap with good parking and a great location."
"Stayed 6 nights here. The first 2 nights in room #323 were horrible. AC turned off itself every 50 minutes. Called the technician 4 times and there was nothing he could do about it. 
The floor was sticky, the room was damp, the entire feel of the place is so crumbling (pictures on Agoda must've been taken decades ago). The bathroom stinks and the water is dirty and salty. 
Moving to #219 after 2 nights, I felt a bit of relief as the room was in so much better shape. The AC is comfortably cold, the bed was so much more comfortable. 
The staff were quite reliable, but they don't seem too happy to serve you most of the time. Some staff were friendly tho, but in general they might not be hospitable. 
Overall, if you're on a tight budget, this hotel is an OK choice considering the location. But for what I've experienced and the many other options available, I would hardly consider staying here again."
"Value for money, but the tap water is salty and the elevator is dead so better not bring elders or people with disabilities."
"Management can be unhelpful and communicate poorly - problems checking in. Told the room booked online is not available and they try to put me in a twin room, which is smaller and cheaper than the one you booked. Bit of a scam - as they claim to be unable to contact Agoda to confirm rooms - even when booked a week in advance - so don't expect to get what you booked. Rooms are run down, aircon doesn't work and is noisy - gets hot, and difficult to sleep. Bathrooms are moldy and rooms can smell. Changed my room twice after arguing for 30 minutes. Sun loungers are old and dirty - the pool has a lot of sand and dead leaves on the bottom - clearly, never get cleaned. Wi-fi is dreadful - no speed and constantly disconnecting. Younger staff and non-managment staff - such as cleaners, reception etc are pleasant/helpful. Management just tries it on to see if can put guests in cheaper worse rooms. It does not match the photos online at all.  Avoid. There's better available for the price."
Actually I didn't get time to stay there but it would have been nice
"We arrived at 4am, had to wake reception, no greeting filled in paperwork and was given the first room behind office, requested double got two singles, said we could get a double room later that day.  Moved to double room. Room was much better but still needed attention."
"I booked Deluxe Room Pool Side
and strongly request Room Near Pool 
at Ground Floor 
but I was shooting to Third Floor Room113.
,it was the last room walk away from Elevator.
Ps. As Deluxe Room have Bathtub 
but Room113 just has only the shower, NO BATHTUB.
Last day, 16OCT at Morning Time,  at 0700am.
the water pump was broken , so Not taking shower.
Next time I will try to stay here again,
If this situation happened as the same.
I should not return. Forever."
It's an older type hotel which needs some upgradation
The room was quite different from the photo published on the internet. The room was a bit dark. Cleanliness was just average. But the staff were great and very helpfull. Thank you
"Nice hotel, good location, good staff...tired, needs refurbishment.
Wi-fi very poor.
Lift was broken for 3 weeks, issue when your on the 4th floor."
"Although we booked a connecting room, the hotel provided us a family room. Also there was no bathtub in the room. Hotel guide showed the drawing of bathtub."
"My partner and I decided to use the hotel laundry service. All other places we have used have been a fraction of the price.
They charged 350k IDR and after that I see 3 of my lighter coloured t shirts have blue stains all over them. Very unfortunate. Other places will take better care and are a lot cheaper."
"(-)Bad front office service. Check in process took a long time and they demanded that we pay extra 200K for our child although we used the existing beds. Cleanliness and hotel condition definitely needed to be improved.  Towels scattered every corner of the hotel whenever it rains. Some of the hotel staffs were not friendly.  I booked the pool view room but got the washing machine view. 
(+) Many cafes and restaurants in walking distance. You could just walk and enjoy the vibes of Bali"
"Unfortunately this hotel has seen better days. Very good location but most rooms have mold. Staff is friendly and helpful so if you are looking for a budget stay is ok, otherwise look elsewhere"
"We stay for 3 nights, the building and facilities need a serious upgrade. Although the housekeeping does an excellent job of making sure they tidy your bed and room every day. But, the hall is dirty esp on levels 2&3. The shower and sink have salty water make you question where it comes from."
"We came from Amed and stayed a night to be closer to the airport. You get what you pay for. If you're used to nicer places then you won’t care for it. If you're on a budget, you can't beat the location and price. It's not bad and it's not great. It lands in the just OK spot."
"hotel cleanness rate 3/5, the room quite dirty. the bathroom not clean and the floor at bed room feels sticky and the air in the room is damp and not fresh because the air conditioner not working well and  it takes longer to cooling the room. 
Hotel staff 3/5, no breakfast provided because we had to checkout 7AM in the morning, which is breakfast ready at 9AM."
"I book online via Agoda and there is the option you can get twin sharing or Double room but when we went to checkout we got twin sharing as we was couple that was hard to understand. And many problems with the room but soon after complaints they changed the room but next morning we don't have the electricity in only our after i see everywhere is the electricity but not only in our room.
So upset with my stay."
Not much happening in Sanur.  Not too much space around the pool for sunbathing. Average room nothing special.
"my first room was a disaster, dirty, and the bathroom smelled, there are no elevators in some parts of the hotel.  the second room i got was way better, cleaner, but the drastic difference from one room to the next ....but it was in walking distance to to shop and restarants, i enjoyed a couple of the best meals in this area."
"On my last morning, A MAN opened my door without knocking AT 8.20AM (no security lock inside the room). I was terrified, screamed, they realized I was in the room and left.
The door to the balcony was tricky to lock, you need to be careful or else it can be opened from outside. Also when it rained heavily, the water flooded a part of the room.
My bed garments had some stains. The towels were in a gray-ish colour which gave an unclean feeling. Only the overhead shower worked, the removeable one didn't, I'm sure housekeeping knew that because they couldn't wash the sand off the bathroom. I ended up walking in a sandy bathroom for 2 last days of my stay.
Room is not soundproof. People slammed their doors at all hours during the day, making my bed shake (no I didnt exaggerate), sometimes there were hammer sounds from room above so loud. They must be renovating or just doing housekeeping.
They put slippers provided in room details, but there were no slippers. Inconvenient for a beach town."
"The maintenance of the hotel is obviously no good. When I went there the lift was broken. The hot water was not working too. Somehow, no one bother to tell you about that."
It's be nice if more variable menu breakfast and the towel should be renew
"the staff is nice, but i requested for double bed only to be given 2 single bed on both my bookings. 
3am in the morning the electric fuse got broken and i ended up waking at wee hours to find the phone not working and have to walk to reception to informed them there is no power in my room.
to my horrror on my last day while checking if i left anything on the bed to realize the bedlinen was not change as there is stain under the comforter, the towers provided looks like it have been used for ages and was never clean."
Photos of location on Agoda not accurate. Smelly bathroom. Property needs renovation or at least update.
Has not been maintained during covid. Air conditioning poor tv selection terrible compared to previous stays.
"I have to say that this is the worst hotel I have ever staying in Bali. We arrived at hotel at 530pm but the room were still not ready (check in time is at 2pm). We have to stand there to wait for the housekeeper to set up the bed after a tiring day. 
I booked a room for 3 person but apparently is not suitable for 3, it is very small. 
The bed also very smelly when we first checked in, we approached staffs and feedback for this, but were told by the staffs that there is no extra bedsheet to change. But ended up there is. 
The most frustration part is the room they give to us, the wall is leaking, the floor is always wet and cannt be dried after we slept first night. The bed was all wet after the first night, absolutely not suitable for people to stay.
I think it is really depends which staff you approached. On the second day, we had a very helpful staff to settle the issue by changing a room for us. 
The facilitation is very old. And also be aware, it is very noisy if you stay at the ground floor facing the pool side. 
Overall, it wasn’t a pleasant staying there and I don’t think I will ever come back to stay there. 
For those who is planning to stay here, make sure you get a proper room."
"When I booked on line I only had one choice of a room so that’s my only option I booked and with a double bed. When I arrived I was told only single beds available but I could pay more for a double bed. Then one of the staff gave me a card and said next time book direct. There won’t be a next time the place is nothing like the pictures very run down old inside. The bedroom paint falling off the walls and the shower and basin water was so salty cleaner at the beach I think.  The restaurant for get that one. As for the noise of slamming doors and people talking in the corridor at 11pm at night
I’m sure there is better value after I paid the extra it wasn’t a cheap place only in looks."
"a hotel for lovers of rusty iron, available in the bathroom starting from the sink faucet, faucet in the bathtub and shower."
"AC not working at all and I need to sleep a night with air flow only. Wall to bathroom bubble, ceiling shower dirty, front office staff didn’t gave clear information about the direction, room number and room facility"
"First. 
I didn’t ask about breakfast during the check-in because I was pretty sure my stay is without breakfast. But then the staff in the reception told me, without me asking, my booking comes w free breakfast. I even asked triple confirm with him if the breakfast really included. He said YES, and highlighted me on the breakfast timing and stuff. The next morning I came down to have my breakfast, suddenly the staff in the restaurant said my room doesn’t include free breakfast. She even checked with reception. I told her the reception boy yesterday told me it is included even after I confirmed few times with him, and said I can come down to have my breakfast. Until the waitress called duty manager come to my table, and the duty manager said it is exclusive of breakfast. It was pretty disappointed with the guy receptionist confirmation, when me myself pretty certain my booking is without a breakfast. He could’ve make certain of my booking. Bad communication. 
Second. 
The door was so difficult to open with the key. And it seemed like an abandoned door. Not access card; they re using ordinary old-style key. I tried few times. Until I need to go down to the reception and asked for their help. Bad. Very bad. 
Third. 
The room was old. With dirty walls. I asked them how old is the property, they said it is just built on 2019. But it doesn’t look like one. Really I don’t like Abian Harmony. Online picture tells lie. 
Fourth. 
The water heater was not functioning good. Not warm, at all. And the tap water was salty and smelly. I wasn’t convinced with Abian Harmony, at all. 
Am a frequent flyer to Bali every 2-3 months. And am not gonna stay in Abian Harmony anymore and I won’t recommend tis hotel to people. Honestly."
We had a late check-in and were assigned to Room 215 for a night. The room looked unoccupied for quite sometime. The tap water was salty. To shower and wash up in salty tap water just felt so wrong. The towel rack mounted on the bathroom wall and the shower head were rusty. The lightings in the room and the bathroom were very dim. The bath towels provided looked old. The tiled floor was sticky with sands. The king size bed was firm but felt like there’re bed bugs as skin gets a little itchy over sometime. We checked-out in less than 12 hours.
Need renovation on many sites of the hotel
Rooms are outdated with mould. Fan in bathroom is like a helicopter. Room had funny smell to it.
"Our check in was at 2am - got a room with a broken AC. Sent maintenance instead of changing rooms at first. Then changed rooms — at 3am. 
The breakfast didn’t make sense. The American option was a good portion but If you got anything else on the breakfast menu the portion size was 1/4 that of the American breakfast option.  
The bathrooms were very smelly. The water was salty coming from the taps.  
Staff were very pleasant — only good feature."
"Weeks before, i call the hotel to check my resv, and ask about the transit room type means,the guy who’s answering my phone said that it is okay i can have a full 4 nights stay w/out mention any charges. When i arrive, the front desk said there’s no reservation under my name, and i show them my phone to show my booking confirmation from agoda. They are so rude they even said “do u think its make sense u only paid this amount for 4 nights in a hotel?!” Its is make sense to me coz i got that kind of promo a lot before. I just dont agree that u can speak that way to a guest. They allow me to stay only 3 nights and add an extra 80k. So i need to find another hotel for the 4th night. Im just really tired and my toddler child is already sleepy. And they put me on the third floor at the very end of the hallway in the corner, and the elevator was out of service. So everytime i need to carry my child back up and down to and from third floor. The room lay out also odd. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone, not because of the property, but because of the staff services. As long as 3 night stay i only found 2 friendly staff. Mostly the only nice to foreigner guests, but not so nice to local guests"
They need to improve in readiness and cleanliness
Blood stains on sheet. Dirty yellow pillows. We left and found another hotel.
"Room is not clean. we booked a single bed superior room but they gave double bed room but there AC not worked so we asked them then they changed the room and gave single bed room, even in that room also AC not worked properly we suffered whole night, without sleep."
Its is not good for couple its hotel is full of seepage
"Booked for 2 nights stayed 1...not my cup of tea. Dirty, old, uncomfotable bed, lumpy pillows Deceived by the pictures."
"We stayed at Abian Harmony on two separate occasions in Feb 2017.
The hotel has around 70 rooms which are kept spotlessly clean.  We were made to feel welcome from the moment of check in by the hotel's fabulous staff who could not have been more helpful.
The rooms are quite large and all appear to have a balcony, most of them overlooking the pool area. 
The Abian Harmony is located just a few minutes walk from the beach and a short bemo ride or 5-10 minute walk to the centre of town.  That said, there are a number of good quality restaurants in the street outside the hotel.
The pool is quite large and has a children's area making it a great option for families with younger kids.
We will be back in Sanur next month and will be booking into Abian Harmony again.  This hotel is great value for money."
"I stayed at Abian Harmony Hotel for 4 days and 4 nights, in a 3-bed room with 2 friends. The room was huge! There were 2 sinks separated from the toilet and shower, a wardrobe, cabinets, a couch, and a balcony. There was more than enough room for the 3 of us to feel cozy and not too cramped. The balcony overlooked the busy street but we couldn't hear any noise in the mornings or evenings. The staff was friendly and very attentive with any room needs or questions that we had. We asked them suggestions for restaurants, touring, and activities, and they told us the good places where locals go. Our package included breakfast every morning - a dish chosen from a menu along with unlimited fruit, salad, toast, coffee, and tea. The hotel is right next to a money exchage, which was really convenient for us. Grab and taxi drivers often knew ""The Abian Hotel"" so it was easy to navigate. Overall great stay!"
"After a very bad experience on a week stay at a previous accommodation, we needed to find a place for the last 2 nights, at very short notice for a party of 10 people, 2 children & 8 adults. We were welcomed By Gus, Julia & a large amount of extremely friendly staff. For a low budget hotel, the level of service at the Abian was exceptional, nothing was too much trouble. The facilities offered are fantastic, from the restaurant, pool, spa even the help on hand with helping organise day trips & tours. We required a late check out of 6:30pm. For a minimal charge we had a room with beds, cot to put the baby down for a sleep & somewhere to freshen up/shower during the day. There was construction work in progress at the time of our stay, which was dealt with by the staff & did not hinder our comfortable & pleasurable stay. They also offer an airport shuttle service at a very reasonable price. Many thanks to Gus, Julia & all the staff, keep up the fantastic work guys. Darran, Fiona & family."
"We stayed at the Abian Harmony for 10 days in June 2018, the staff and service were excellent, always friendly and helpful'.  The Hotel location is great with excellent restaurants very close to the hotel.  A great place to stay and relax."

Massage and spa packages were very affordable but not up to the standard. The hair spa I did left my hair coarse and dry. The therapist who did the hair spa used really hot water to wash my hair, which made me wonder if she even understands what hot salty water of sanur can do to the hair. I didn't feel like she was invested in giving me the best results. 
Good massuese. But it also depends. My friends thought it was just okay. I thought mine did a great job"
