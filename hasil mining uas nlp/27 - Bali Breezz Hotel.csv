"this is my second time staying at Bali Breezz and i still have the same feeling - feel at home..  it is comfortable, healthy (because it's surrounded by gardens), can swim anytime - unlike in big hotels where the use of the pool is in limited time, clean and all the staff are friendly.  I will always recommend Bali Breezz to everyone who wants to travel to Bali. thank you BB..!!"
"A big shout out for the lady who works at the restaurant, always smiling, polite, keen to help. 
We had an amazing time at this place since from the minute when we arrived there. Everyone was so polite and helpful. Can’t wait to get back 😊"
"We were staying in a Deluxe Room for 7 days and decided to extend 2 more days. Spacious, very clean, breakfast was very good (you have a lot of options) and the staffs very helpful and friendly. Highly Recommended!"
"Excellent value for money! The area is very tourist friendly, the beach is very close to the hotel ( a 1min walk), everything’s super clean in the room could stay there all day it has everything you need, great breakfast options, it’s even close to many spots that have great seafood ! Communication with staff was pretty smooth, they helped with everything..Loved my stay there and will definitely go back !"
"I only stayed one night but I vowed to stay here again. The studio room features funky design, the bed is comfortable, the extensive gardens are spacious, the exterior design unusual and interesting with large, mirrored doorframes acting as visual pleasers, several (!) swimming pools, a delicious eggs Benedict for breakfast included in the low price (there were other selections too) and 100 metres walk to the beach. Staff were pleasant and helpful, too."
The staffs were very friendly and helpfull. And the room were clean and neat. Recommended and will be surely staying again in this hotel
"I would like to take this opportunity to compliment front desk team, on the outstanding costumer service they provided to my family. They was very nice, respectful and accomodating. Thank you."
Because the bali breezz Hotel was so cheap we were apprehensive in what it would be like. It was very good. Breakfast was include and excellent. We dined in the evening and was great food at a great price. Staff excellent. Good sunbeds and pools. Close to the beach where in the evening many seafood restaurants.
Excellent value for money the service you would get in a 5 star hotel for a fraction of the price!
"Good. Size rooms, great bathroom. Pools good, need more chairs. Resto good lunches. Staff great and quick to fix any problems.
Best TV we have had in Bali. 
Short walk to beach and all the beautiful beach restaurants"
"Just spent 7 days in this adorable little paradise just around 150m from the beautiful  beach in Jimbaran. Its not very new but very well maintained!
Due to the corona time there were very few guests only but the staff were as present as we are used to, the rooms cleaned as bright as ever and we were served very personally and very warmly. Tks to all of them!
We were not here for the first time and will always be happy to come back!"
"A great place, pretty central in Denpasar. If you're landing late or have an early flight, this place is about 20 mins from the airport. Complementary breakfast available."
Friendly staff clean but shower water pressure not strong other than that very good
"The room was not so spacious but still comfortable, the aircon is cool, the room & bathroom are clean. The pool is right in front of the room. The hotel has 4 pools and the staff are friendly. It   was cool to lying on the chair around the pool. The Jimbaran seafood restaurants are close to the hotel and reachable by walking"
"The Wifi was very fast, very close to the beach for running, and very helpful and friendly staff."
"We stay there now for second time and we will come back again.
It is an little bit old hotel but all rooms, the hotel area and the pools was very very clean. The staff and the management was top - all the time there are friendly and helpfully...
We will come back again :-)"
This was a great find. Very comfortable and a great location. Will stay again.
"The room was nice and pretty modern. The bathroom could be a bit better but it wasn't too bad. There were pools onsite. Property was very big. The breakfast included was pretty good. Overall, would recommend."
"Very near to the beach, good room but not that big if you have children, good service and staff."
I’ll go again for sure. Thanks for everything.
"Charming and chill hotel in Jimbaran just 50 meters from the beach. Easy walk to the fish market - around 1.3 km away and to the endless chain of seafood restaurants on the beach.
The staff and service were great, super friendly and welcoming. The breakfast choice was very good, and the restaurant was nice and reasonably priced.
Apart from a few design issues in the room, like lack of storage and lack of a place to hang wet clothes, the room was a generous size, with comfy bed and excellent Aircon.
I would recommend to change the rain shower head with a hand shower because it's very difficult to wash your feet or to take a shower without wetting your hair."
"Booked the villa, large and beautiful space. Heater takes awhile to start, and as they're cutting cost, you have to order breakfast the day beforehand"
"I enjoyed  a lot, they rent a bike. strategic area. refreshing view."
Very like the friendly staff! Like this place so muchhhhh💯💯
"The hotel is unexpectedly beautiful. The room is kinda small but comfy. The view is perfect! It's a semi-outdoor hotel, so you can chilling out by the pool or the canteen. You can walk to nearby seafood restaurants, just google map it and you'll find it easily."
"It’s a value for money. They include nice breakfast. Rooms are clean and aesthetically pleasing. Premise is well maintained.
The only issue in my room (137) was that the AC didn’t cool the room enough so I didn’t have a good sleep. I guess it’s just problem with my room only.
 Other than that everything else was top notch.  They also have rental scooters so ask them if you need one.
Book with a peace of mind."
There are several small pools which was nice to be able to choose. Rooms are small but clean and had everything we needed for our short stay.
The hotel is perfect!! Highly recommend
"Very near the beach, not far from the fish market, small bungalows, quiet, excellent breakfast. Jimbaran is the perfect place for the ones who hate the mass tourism of Kuta, Seminyak or Sanur and the luxious gated resorts and international impersonal chain hotels"
Very clean place.
"Staff were very nice and helpful. Value was excellent. There were multiple small pools at the hotel. Food there is good, I recommend the breakfast.only a block from the beach but a lot of debri and trash on the beach."
all is good xcept the water
The price and location are very good. Breakfast was fresh and unlimited coffee and fruit at breakfast a nice touch.
"Friendly staff, good rooms, clean pool and the food is amazing!"
Solid nice clean hotel 3 swimming pools lots of green grass and open space near to beach decent breakfast amazing staff
Very cool and good hotel
"The location and the hotel surroundings are very nice. The room is quiet small and it was humidly. But got all the room amenities. Unfortunately the toilet was very smelly.
The breakfast was nice. The staffs were very helpful"
"the hotel was really quiet because i stayed there during the pandemic, the staffs is nice, only the staff guy that is in charged during nighttime is kinda ignorant but the lady was really nice. had a good time staying there!"
"Very good location and staff were nice and friendly The breakfast also is good and our room was comfortable recommend this place ,"
Friendly staff. Near to beach. 3 pools. Fantastic. Will stay again of visit Bali
"Was much better than expected for the price we paid during the high season (Christmas and New year's). Staff was friendly. Very quiet and located close to the beach, which is always good. Breakfast was simple, but to be expected for the price of the hotel."
"Staffs are good, clean, facility. overall good expectance."
Very good place and personal.
"Recommended place to stay in Jimbaran.
 👍"
"Great price & great location near Jimbaran beach. Facilities are a bit outdated,  but clean. The staff was very friendly."
Beautiful property and amazing hospitality
"Got the exec room at usd14. At this prc it's great value. Free American bf set, location very near to some seafood resto, quiet location, strong a/c. Hotel resto serves tasty food tho the menu is limited. Hard to find local Warung food here. During my stay, WiFi was bad. On and off, and often problematic. The hotel is trying to rectify it, tho. The pools are great."
"We stayed only for one night at this hotel and turned out that we had amazing hospitality experiences from the hotel staffs, hotel new renovation rooms and also yummy food from the garden restaurant!"
Super hôtel
"If you want to save money this is the right one for you, with the nice breakfast and fresh fruits, nice pool, very helpful staff, one time I lost an important thing and they help me find it, nice food in the menu. You can take out breakfast. Heater works very well."
"Downsides: 
• located in a dingy, lifeless neighborhood.
• some of the room types may be too tiny.
• the hotel's spa services are priced too high for a 2* hotel.
• not disabled-friendly.
Upsides:
• all the staff are hospitable and eager too help. Kudos!!
• the executive room is spacious and fully functional (TV, AC, Water heater, and WiFi).
• thorough cleaning is done on a daily basis.
• 3 swimming pools.
• near a popular bigul place.
• luxurious breakfast options for a 2* hotel.
Overall, despite paying pennies for my stay, the hotel and the staff performance far exceeded my expectations. 👍"
"Three pools, big rooms and clean. Good value for money and staff are friendly."
Simple hotel in good location in middle section of Jimbaran beach. Good value and quite satisfactory for 2 or 3 days. One of the best options available in Jimbaran.
Like this hotel
"Bali Breezz Hotel is great value, close to a good beach & seafood warungs.  Studio was compact but had everything you needed including good air-conditioning & wifi.  3 pools & a garden Cafe were great.  Staff were lovely. Surrounding area is a little shabby but safe.  Not 5 star but fantastic value."
"… don’t bother with the breakfast (fortunately it’s optional) , the worst upcharge I had in Bali!"
Pools are good to relax. Quiet area at night. Breakfast is nice too.
"Nice place , 3 swimming pools, perfect garden , good breakfast and super nice location"
"its a very nice place to stay with family,  three swimming pool and nice garden, nice breakfast"
"Nice room, good food, and they have two swimming pools! Clean and neat, awesome place with affordable price!"
"Good rates for short/ long-term stays and just a short ride to many attractions or short walk to the beach. Problem is, 5* comfort is room dependent. I loved my studio room 124 design/ layout over the superior room 141, but my gawd, the drainage for the toilet is HORRIBLE. Whole shower FLOODs the toilet and it's marble flooring! Not enough space to hang laundry in both rooms too. The rod/ bar in the studio room 124 is too close too the wall so you can't hang clothes without touching the wall (is it even sanitised....) We had to hang clothes on the chair taken from inside the room, and placed it in the opposite room's lawn space to get sun. Room 141 had tables and chairs outside to drape whatever for convenience, but woe is us should the neighbour's smoke get to them, and I had a heavy smoking European oldie who also played music at 7am! Can smell from the toilet too. Toiletries are only topped up upon request. All rooms came with just ONE TOWEL and ONE teaspoon despite two glass mugs. Staff are smiley/ friendly enough but not all that attentive as in a 4-5* star establishment."
"This has got to be one of my fave low cost accoms now.
All works sans the WiFi - good only at the reception area.
All else is good.
Bfast is basic but does the job.
Loved the sound of the waves crashing in - it's only about 100m away from the sea.
You get to see both sunset and sunrise from the hotel premise.
The studio is small but very doable. 
Ok, they need to provide proper liquid soap though. 
Overall - I am a happy camper!"
I really love to stay here especially with the beautiful garden and swimming pool!
"The hotel is good, but the room hasn't got natural light. There's an open window door, but if you want natural light, everyone passing-by sees you."
"Superior room 141 was pretty standard and felt a little cramped. It was shared with two smoking neighbours on each side, and unfortunately, we non-smokers and laundry that was aired on the wooden chairs and table outside couldn't avoid them. No cupboard but just a rack with three unremovable hangers. Studio Room 124 was chic but had very poor water drainage. Whole toilet with smooth marble flooring was flooded after awhile. No cupboard too, and there were two removable hangers. We hung laundry on the provided brolly (which the previous room didn't have) and a chair, and this side had four units.  Pool is decent, and warm enough at night. Simple breakfast, and staff are friendly/ helpful. Hardworking and smiley Coco (who worked every role since 2013) assisted in an express check in at 7+pm and got us our bike on the second day."
"Staff hotel yg ramah, fasilitas ok"
"perfect location but: no hot water to have a shower, no welcome drink as it says and i asked the guy at the reception if he could order a gojek for me and he said they dont do that..."
Instagramable
Loved the stay here.Fairly good priced.Only Con is that I had to remind the staff to do daily cleaning of the room.
Good value for the money
Avoid standard or deluxe room. They may either be too small or have problems
Good hotel for family traveller
The worst pancakes in Indonesia
"The Bali Breezz is a very economical option and in a good location.
It is clean, well run and has a choice of 3 swimming pools !"
"Bungalows in a nice garden settung with 3 pools. I recommend to go for premier rooms if you like to have a outside sitting area. standard rooms and suites are kinda small and no balcony. The breakfast was good, although it had to be ordered a day in advance. 
The hotel is located near the beach (4 min) and near many great restaurants (if you love fish). They put their tables on the beach in the evening, which was great.
The only negative:
The staff is not as friendly and helpful as in other places, which absolutely needs improvement."
"Pros: Excellent location down a quiet lane. Close to the airport and only 2 minute walk to the beach or a 7 minute walk to Jimbaran seafood restaurant area.
Cons: Bed had sand inside it. Room was a bit dated. The entire resort is in various states of disrepair. Room was not ready when I checked in at 5pm? Weird."
"The management of this hotel seems like an absentee landlord. We stayed in three different room types - Executive, premiere and studio. The Executive was the best - a bit funky with the industrial design but good otherwise. The studio was tiny and the premiere room was very dated. None of the rooms have racks for hanging your wet bathing suit. Some have a clothes line in the bathroom that you can pull out but there is no way that it would dry there. 
Out of the three swimming pools, only one was useable. The other two were “under maintenance”. 
The location is good - a short walk to the beach and beachfront restaurants.
The staff could use some training in customer service, especially at the restaurant. We felt like we were disturbing them when we asked for a menu, or wanted to order food! Breakfast was very good, particularly the coffee and eggs benedict."
Just ok. Dont expect more
Beautiful location and indulge in nature
Need hotel transport to the airport; local taxis harassing online transport
"The room is small, the toilet very smelly..staff is friendly..cannot say much as the price is cheap"
"Tiny pools with mouldy cushions in the sun beds. One pool was all green with algae. 
Bathrooms are open aired so at night with the light on you attract bugs."
"Spacious rooms, damaged entrance door of private pool vila, and very basic Breakfast are the highlights. You need to carry your own luggage to and from the room."
Hotel ok. Good housekeeping. Breakfast in the restaurant awful. I called it the restaurant of empty trays. Absolutely no service from the staff.
"The hotel is located strategically at the beach, breakfast is great.
However, staff is not helpful at all.
Request that were made prior to bookings were ignored and staff needs a re-training to ensure guest satisfaction."
The washroom is smelly. The door cant be lock or unlock easily. It always stuck. Already complain to the staff. But still the same. The rooms are very small for the price.
"I stayed 2 days, 1st night, they provided 2 small bottle of mineral water. On 2nd day, the person in charge said that there was no stock, I have to buy the mineral water. Definitely not recommended. The location is far (I did not really check properly prior booking). My first booking did not go through, then I have to rebook without breakfast. The room was not clean on 2nd day. Even I put empty mineral water bottles outside, it’s still there. Definitely not going to stay here again."
"The hotel is located minutes away from the beach. In terms of hotel facilities,  there is clear sign that the hotel is try to recover from Covid. There"
"Disappointing hotel, smallest room ,food very ordinary, pool ok ,clean bathroom ,no wouldn’t stay here again"
The room doesn’t look like in the photo at all. I give only 1 star for that. Because it is misguiding customers.
The washroom is smelly. The doors have issues and always stuck. The room is very small and not worth the money.
"Perfect place to stay for our last day and night in Bali. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had a deluxe room which was great, spacious, clean, and had a small garden. The grounds and swimming pools are lovely. I read through the mixed reviews but felt they were ungrounded. if you like Kuta, want to be surrounded by large hotels and resorts, this is not the place for you. Jimbaran is a lot less developed and much quieter so once you step out of your hotel the rabbit warren of streets are not that attractive but thats Bali. However, Jimbaran beach is a fantastic beach, my favourite in Bali. There are countless number of restaurants along the beach and a beautiful walk along the beach can take you to any restaurant in the larger hotels if you wish to eat more upmarket. Bali Jegeg staff were great, organised us taxi's whenever we needed them and arranged our transfer to the airport. Its really close! We didn't have breakfast as ate out that particular morning so can't comment on food."
"We loved our stay at Bali Breezz - they can send you a driver to collect you at the airport, which is very close-by (15mins by car). The hotel is well appointed, clean and supplies clean sheets and towels each day. Its located in a local Balinese neighbourhood, 2 mins walk from Jimbaran Bay, where its good to stretch your legs on late afternoon/sunset walks & you can enjoy dinner on the beach. We stayed here on the way to Lombok and returned due to the convenience. Do ask/ book a deluxe room, ground level near the pool - if you want a larger room! ENJOY!"
"Me and my boyfriend stay for 2 nights at Bali Breezz hotel. The place was beautiful, the breakfast was perfect. The room itself was nice and clean. We stay in studio room. There is some minus, the aircon not work well, there is a gap between bathroom door so the hot air from bathroom is going into the room. We arrive before check in time, so the staff told us to wait for 10 mins so our room will ready, but turn out that we wait nearly 1 hour. The provide welcome drink too, but they don't guide us where to get that, so we a little bit clueless at first. 
Over all we have a good stay in a good play and good price too"
we decided to stop for one night to Bali Breeze because it's in Jimbaran and just 15min with a taxi to the Bali airport. The hotel is just 3min walking from the beach (beautiful beach of jimbaran). We can enjoy dinner on the beach where we can find different fish salers (you can order fish by weight or ready to eat fish plate). Our guide book said that it's better to arrive before the sunset to have a good table just in front of the sea but we arrive later (around 9pm) and it was perfect (less people) and we can choose our table. The fish was perfect. Bali Breeze is a good place to stay in transit. During the morning we can enjoy to swim directly in the ocean and saw a beautiful boats parade (every morning they came back with their fish). We order a taxi directly with Bali Breeze staff and we arrived to the airport 15 min later. Perfect to enjoy Indonesia until last minute before departure !
"We highly recommend Bali Breeze when visiting Jimbaran area. The facility was beautiful, tropical clean and the staff was very helpful. We recommend leaving the hotel and making a left to enjoy seafood on the beach in one of the highly rated restaurants. Don’t forget to stop by and visit a few of the local vendors. We booked the 2bd villa with private pool. Highly recommend for families with children. Located in the master suite is an out door shower there was a rooster who sang from early am on just be prepared for the early am wake up! Otherwise we highly recommend"
"penning this review based on the feedbacks given by my parents in their 50s, as they say it was their best stay in Bali. firstly, they loved the laidback vibe of jimbaran and really like the stay here as it was slow and relaxed. secondly, it's priced really attractively so it was a grand stay for my parents. from what i understand, this place is newly renovated so the interiors and exteriors are all very nice, with new beds and all give a good quality sleep."
"Had a great time at Villa Bali Jegeg!

Nice new and clean rooms, well spread out and lots of open space in the resort. 

Beautiful pool that was great to unwind after a hard day. 

Staff were friendly and always able to help. 

The inclusive breakfast was fantastic, the best pancakes I have ever had!

Jimbaran as an area is away from the 'hustle and bustle' of central parts of Bali so it is a great place for peace and quiet or to see the more 'local way'"
deluxe room was a good size and fairly clean.  loved the balcony and garden.  pool was adequate size and we were lucky not many guests using it at the time.  only downside to the pool was there was only 2 sun lounges.  breakfast was simple but nice.  all of the staff were friendly and very happy to help and answer questions. well located to take advantage of the seafood restaraunts on the beach.  all in all a very relaxing few days and would recommend villa bali jegeg if you are looking to stay in jimbaran.
"I’ve stayed in over 30 hotels in the last 11 months of solo travel and Breezz would be in my top 5 overall 
Special mention to Gunther and Bagus in the cafe and Made in Reception for warm hospitality"
"This is a clean and comfortable place to stay near the beach. The location is perfect. You're right near the beach, in the middle of the bay, right near the middle set of seafood stands on the beach. The beach itself is very nice – white sand, pleasant and calm water, not crowded – perfect for swimming or laying out and spending time on the beach. We only stayed here one night, as I truly only wanted to eat at the seafood stands. Our dinner was magical, as we had the perfect sunset and tons of fresh seafood. Since we came to this location only for the purpose of spending some time at the beach and having a nice dinner, the hotel was fine. It was the most mediocre hotel we stayed at during our entire vacation, but it was the same price as the others. It gave us what we wanted – a clean, safe room in the Jimbaran location – but not much else. The included breakfast was also the worst that we had during our entire stay in Bali. Our shower was also not a stand-up shower, but a hand-held shower head in a bathtub. We didn't really get Wifi in our room, either. It was a great place to crash for one night to check out the seafood stands and the beach. The area was pleasantly local, without any hawkers or too many tourists!"
"Great location for Jimbaran beach, just a few minutes walk.
Nice, quiet location, facilities include: three pools (!), flat screen TV, good internet, spacious bathroom with good hot shower, choice of breakfasts, bar/restaurant for evening meals, helpful staff, pretty setting.
Main streets of Jimbaran are within walking distance, but the beach is the main attraction, especially for the locally caught seafood, and the sunsets!"
"What a little paradise in the middle of jimbaran, only 5minutes walk from Jimbaran Beach ( One of the most simple & Beautiful in Bali !!) 
Awesome staff !! Awesome place !!"
"Not difficult to find using GPS when you are driving, you can leave the car at the hotel and take a walk to Jimbaran beach close by. Driving to airport was seamless, the nearby eatery place la was convenient. The hotel is also good, stayed on the studio it look really cool. The rustic design was awesome"
"A very nice Hotel with friendly staff and three small pools (one of them where being repared during our stay). Clean place. Only 2 min walk to the Jimbaran beach which is very nice in the evening. A small restaurant at the Hotel, but several restaurants down by the beach."
"It really is a fantastic place, we spent 5 nights and loved everything about it. The rooms are really nice, lovely decorated and super clean. There is a kettle with tea and coffee in each room, and a flat screen TV with even a few channels in English. The grounds are great,  beautiful and very well maintained, heaps of trees and flowers and grass areas, great for kids.  There are three pools, which is fantastic because even when  there were other guests around it felt really private, as  we always had a pool all for ourselves!
Breakfast was great, and there was free coffee, tea and fruit refills (very different from other places in Bali).  Finally, the staff was  great, very friendly and helpful. Will be recommending this place to friends and will be definitely coming back  :)"
"The room is big, clean and the position beside the pool. For breakfast you have to choose, but free flow for drink and fruits. location near the jimbaran beach. we will stay again because my kids love this hotel"
"it is near to the beach and is a great place to relax. you can take your daily morning and evening walk along the vast jimbaran beach. and if you are into bbq dinner and sunset, the local restaurant nearby offer cheap and good bbq seafood. moving about bali from the villa is great as it is away from the crowded kuta area and you do not have to waste time getting stuck in traffic."
"It´s very close to Airport (aprox 20min) and Jimbaran beach (2min walk). The location is still surrounded by traditional houses, no many hotels there. Room was big, mattress was hard enough and aircon working well. Just one think is unexpected - no doors to the toilet, curtain only. Breakfast has three varietes with three meals each and portions was big and food was tasty;-) Pools are small and the number of deckchairs is limited. Overall, it´s nice budget accomm. at Jimbaran location for reasonable price with tasty breakfast."
"Pros:This hotel is amazing, walking distance to jimbaran beach, which is best spot for seafood..n relaxing . There is 3 pool in this hotel, even for kids..nice family or couples environment..nice breeze..
Con: Maybe should have buffet breakfast..
Tq"
"This plce is quite nice. They have 3 swimming pool. The staff are also friendly and helpful. Its just for the breakfast so limited. But so far I love this place. Oh this place is near from the jimbaran beach, only walk for 3 min you can get to the beach."
"The place is perfect, location from the beach is good,  seafood restaurants are a few steps away.  But some staff are not that friendly. But i lovevl the local people of bali. Good wifi with three nice swimming pool . I suggest to get the premier or premium room for the big space. It is just a simple breakfast and you have to choose a day before."
"Villa Bali Jegeg Hotel locates very near to Jimbaran beach with about 5-10 minutes walk. So you can walk back to the hotel after your romantic seafood dinner. However, don't be too late unless you are with a group of friends because the surrounding is really quiet at around 8 pm and feels not safe enough. The hotel is still under expanding construction. However, it won't affect your sleeping, but dusty cannot be avoided. The superior room itself was average, but its in-room WiFi speed was quite OK. There is no door for the bathroom which has only a curtain to separate. Draining in the bathroom was bad. I did not like the shower because it is directly on you head and cannot be adjusted. Breakfast was OK and staffs were nice. I will give a score of 7.5 out of 10."
Excellent location.  3mins walk to beach. Room is a bit run down  and small but adequate. Good facilities with kids and adult pools.
"Very nice and clean territory with 3 swimming pools. Good choice of breakfasts. Our double room was quite small and old but I think there are better options, at least we had a cosy terrace in front of the room with a table and chairs. The staff is friendly and helpful except of one guy who could not solve little issues."
"Good location, affordable price. 
Lacking: cleanliness, some of the furnitures are already worn out, TV did not work at all."
Is just so so... but with many villa in bali this one is just not worth it.. can find other place that also cheap and have better facilities
"We stayed in the private pool villa. Its  quite tired and in need of an upgrade, but really can't be beaten for the price. 350 metres from Jimbaran Beach and easy walk to the seafood restaurants. If you're after a private villa with your own pool, at a budget price, the Bali Breezz cannot be overlooked."
"The Premier Room is spacious with big washroom. The shower room floor is very slippery, suggest to place a anti-slip floor mat."
Short walk to the beach and sunset restaurant.
