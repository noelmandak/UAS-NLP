"We are looking for an airport hotel but still has access to the city, and this hotel exactly what we need. The price is very reasonable, and the facilities are pretty good. 
They have comfortable room, and also super clean. Their pool also great, and their breakfast is excellent. 
Their location is superb, 5-10 minutes by car to airport but surrounded by mini shop and delicious restos. FYI, one of the best Ayam Betutu in town is just next to this hotel. 
And about the staff, they have amazing staffs. We order deluxe room, but the front office (Tariza) upgrade our room for free! Thank you!
The cons maybe just, seems that this hotel is government event favourite, so sometimes in the morning they are quite loud. But if you stay for ur next flight or just to visit the city, I will strongly recommend this hotel."
"Perfect hotel if you need a layover pre/post flight. I had 8 hours to kill so checked in at 2pm and went to the airport at 10pm.
The rooms are very clean and tidy. Bedding and towels in great condition. 
The pool is sensational! Spent the afternoon relaxing then jumped in the shower before going to the airport.
Airport was only 4 minutes away and 30k on a Gojek car."
"Only Upon booking my room, I informed the hotel that I am coming for honeymoon. Mr Felix// Mr Victor managed to meet our special requirements. Thank you for that. Mr Felix had been really warm in welcoming us to the hotel. He guided us with the local transportation and places to visit to. 
The staff set up our room in a beautiful manner. It was so pleasant.
All the staffs are very respectful, attentive and extremely friendly. They are very rich in culture. Anytime I needed assistance, I was attended immediately.
The food was great. The place in its entirety was so clean and beautiful. Had a beautiful pool view with cafe by the side
A special thank you to the house keeping staff, Mr Wiana. He set up my room (for honeymoon set up) and attended to my room's housekeeping. He is very friendly and warm. Each day when we return to our room after travelling, we get to a very clean and neat room. Even the littlest things, arrangements. I was very impressed and my husband appreciated it too. Thank you so so much.
My husband and I had a great stay at this place. Will definitely come back again and would highly recommend this place to others. :)"
"This hotel is amazing for its price.
Big pool, big bed, very clean and great stuff.
The only small minus is they dont have any kids club for now (previously they do have one).
Overall really enjoy our short stay here."
"We went to Bali for a wedding, so we only needed a place to stay for one night. Although, we had to book for two nights for our flight home was at night. We chose this hotel because of its very close proximity to both the aiport and wedding venue, which was at Kartika Plaza street. Another plus was that they provided airport pick-up. The staff overall were very friendly, especially our driver who picked us up at the airport. We also used their complementary shuttle to the Discovery Mall. The last scheduled shuttle was at 4 pm, but when we asked if it was still possible since the time was already 4.30 pm they were kind enough to still take us (thank you). We loved the spacious room, comfortable beds, and great shower. Breakfast was by the pool and nice varieties of western and asian. It was a short and quick trip for us. We would definitely stay here again."
"We stay here when we land in bali as it is near to the airport. The AC is great, always on for us as requested, room service is a great price, the rooms are always spotless, and breakfast is yummy, lots of choice. Will  continue to stay"
"Staff is very helpful ….
Room  big and clean
Price is worth it 
Hotel alway full cause the best service ever
Two thumb"
"This is a very central close to the airport , Kuta 
Beach ,the big shops in Tuban ,5 minute walk to many good restaurants and the food ordered from room service was really high quality and good value . Big shout out to house keeping thank you Wiana for servicing our room which was cleaned daily ."
"The location, price, facilities, cleanliness are the best! Especially the staffs! So kind, and helpful 💗 it is near Kuta beach and surrounded by so many delicious local foods! Best for your transit hotel or long stay 👌"
"The best for stay... Very clean & comfort.. 
Good staff.. good location 
We love it so much.."
"Room is clean, cool AC, service is good, only 5 minuets for kuta beach, if you dont like kuta busi night life party, but still prefer to stay near kuta beach, this place is recommended, will back here if i visit Bali again."
"Good: swimming pool is huge, breakfast is outstanding, the watercooler is the hallway is a huge plus, early check in, room was very big, staff is super friendly!,
Bad: location is not great for going to the beach, very soft matress (we didn't like that), wifi cam be a bit slow
I would change that the beach chairs around at the swimmingpool are standing in the water.??was a bit worried I would drop my phone in the water."
"Close to the airport, good for those who want to catch early or late flight. We got free upgrade to family room. No complain except for the poor wifi."
"I visited this hotel with my wife and 11yo daughter and everything was spot on. Always kind and smiling personnel and they didn't charge extra for a late checkout (traffic jam).  thx
The room was inviting and with a lovely smell of roasted coffee.  Everything in the room was new. Big TV, great water pressure, awesome bed, and pillows. I even put the pillow out from the cover to find out, what brand they use so I can buy it home.  The air condition worked perfectly and quiet.
We also enjoyed the gym and a very nice swimming pool. 
The breakfast buffet was very good with lot of fresh, cooked, Asian and western options so you will not be bored even after a few mornings. Dinner in the restaurant was also good. 10 / 10 for me and also from my family.  We will definitely come back for our next trip to Kuta. Thank you."
Love the place. Easy and many street food nearby hotel!staff are really friendly
"We had a late flight into Bali and an early flight out, so this was a great place to rest overnight."
"Hotel bersih, harga ekonomis, staf ramah, makanan resto enak"
So clean and cheap and big room with balcony with stunning views kind staff
"Nice location, close to airport, and we got upgraded to pool access room. Thanks so much."
Clean and well maintained spacious room. We booked this hotel to get quick and easy access to the airport in the morning. Provide an excellent breakfast. Suitable for all types of travelers
"The hotel is a very good location, very near to the busy tourist area of Kuta but also nearby to local restaurants.
Room was a nice size and AC was nice nice and cold.
Unlimited water as they had dispenser in the hallway.
Swimming pool was nice and big, the only downside that the decking area hadn't been cleaned for a while, many of the sun loungers had dried bird excrement on them and the floor, I expect though that this is due to Corona virus and limited staff so happy to ignore that.
The room was pretty clean however the 2 drinking glasses provided were dirty with one having a lipstick mark, this is disappointing as the room has been sealed with a stick to say it had been cleaned before use.
But appart from the small little issues I would still be very happy to stay there again, it's great blue for money."
"Nice to stay here, hotel very clean, staff very helpful"
Had a great trip ..highly recommended.
Nice staffs and clean room
Was stayed here for one night. All is good. Surely will comeback soon. Thank you!
"Best hotel, staff yg ramah & helpfull, pilihan breakfast banyak & enak2 😍"
"Pros:
- clean & nice room design (I stayed in tripple-bed room with 3x100cm-wide bed)
- swimming pool is nice, child- friendly
- all the staffs are helpful and friendly
- breakfast choice good enough
Cons (only minor thing)
- no body lotion (I think it would be helpful while you’re travelling in Bali)"
I got upgrade room with same price from Ms. Pebri.  Excellent.
I got upgrade room with same price from Ms. Pebri. Excellent
"Bersih, akomodatif, sarapan variatif, worth the money"
"Staff are really friendly and helpful! Place is super close to the beach, mall and eating places.  Will definitely come here again"
"Location is a bit far from the shopping mall, still some distance.
Room is clean, staff is friendly and helpful, no comment for the meal as I didn’t try, but massage is not bad.
In overall, worth the money."
"The hotel it self an old property, but well maintain. The facilities were good. 
Friendly staffs, all was good, spacious room, 1 queen bed and 1 single bed, TV channel worked perfectly and clear.
Aircon was cool and well maintained.
The only thing I would complain was the location of our room very far to elevator and staircase, need to walk a bit far.
Breakfast provide many meal options, and we gave points 7 out of 10.
We stayed 2 nights."
This is a lovely hotel
"Staff so friendly, facilities is good, strategic location."
"We stayed here for 1 afternoon as our flight left at midnight. What a lovely hotel, clean, lovely linen, beautiful pool and very close to the airport. There isn't a lot around the hotel to do but its a great hotel to just rest and relax in."
Best hotel so far during my visit in Bali
"The hotel very clean, staff so helpfull and the location near to central kuta."
I stayed one night with my husband and one daughter in this hotel. This hotel is only 5mins to the airport and have good facilities that you need. Recommended.
Staff are very friendly
"Nice stay. Good breakfast and facilities.
Definitely recommended."
Pegawainya ramah
"Room is good with this price
Room was cleaned bedding not smelly was good 
Breakfast is poor not much to eat"
One of the best hotel in Kuta area.
"Very nice hotel and service, really recommend to stay here"
Best location
"We chose this hotel as overnight transit, good location close to airport. Would not choose this place otherwise."
Hotel is nice clean and staff very helpful. I asked to change room because a bit noice from upper room and they moved me to the upper floor. Just the gym need to be maintain better.
Nice staff and service
"We booked SwissBel as flight arriving late.
We then moved to a 5star property.
SwissBel was easily nicer in the size of rooms, decor, attitude of lovely staff and general layout of the hotel.
About a 15 min walk to shopping area. Not an overly pleasant walk but when you pay $50 for such a lovely hotel who cares.
Will definitely stay again"
Staff cepat respon
"Good hotel, recomended, like the other swissbell group"
"so many people, noisy, good swimming pool"
"Pros:
cheap price for swissbel
full amenities complete in room instead current condition
All facilities open and in good shape
Cons:
Nothing"
Friendly staff and value price
you find your home in this hotel
"Good hotel, friendly & helpful staffs, decent location, enough minimarkets, warungs, and even local laundry steps away from the hotel if you need one.
Stayed here during the busy new year period, only nit picking complain is that you might need to call the operator/front desk (by dialling 0 on the house phone) several times before it will be picked up during busy season - but then again, that's just nit picking"
Book for room with pool view.
"The hotel staff = 5 stars
Some of idiot guests making noise in the hallway at 2 am, pls put any warning / reminder sign for those kind of guests who probably their first time staying at hotel."
We stayed overnight before transferring to Ubud. Great hotel close to airport with very friendly staff and great service.
Negative point is we had to wait until 2pm to check in while the hotel occupancy is not even at 50%. The staffs rather stick to the book then the customer orientation.
"This Hotel location is close to airport, but if you have transportation, it would be very good choice.  Less crowd unlike others."
"Book here because it‘s near to the airport, but it’s super nice. Plus we got free upgrade. Super comfy!"
"Everything is good, nothing special just a standard hotel"
"Well located hotel with great restaurant staff , good size room with buffet breakfast overlooking a nice pool"
The hotel is good price with the big room
"Near airport, good location, helpful staff, I am recommending"
"Breakfast: 6/10
(almost same menu everyday)
Gym: 6/10
Swimmingpool: 8/10
Hotel SPA: 8/10
Now about the room:
Cleanliness: overall OK
Soundproof: very poor"
"Nice hotel during pandemic give the facilities like hand sanitizer, masker, gloves. The staffs are friendly. The sofa bed in room smelly should be get maintenance to clean up the smell. The room a little bit noise because part of wall partition using gypsum."
"AC & shower is strong. Good location. Convenience store and laundry nearby. Good room, good hotel!"
The staff are marvelous and helped me give this place a better rating.
The room is very big and the price very good
best hotel with bargain price due to pandemic
"It's not located at prime area, staff didn't clean area under the bed so its so dirty and dusty. Water was stinks but okay after you run it for sometime. However, the look and feel of the hotel is okay in general but not in detail."
"stayed one night only for transit, close to the airport and in the center of crowd. the room is decent but the service is so-so during corona pandemic stay."
"Same breakfast for 4days make it boring, the reason is pandemic"
quite good for a place to stay in Bali. location strategic and affordable price but internet connection is not strong and stable compare to others. thanks
"There's no complaint about the staff. They all try to please us whenever possible. 
But the Hotel..
Okay, 1st.. they only gave us 1 room key. So it's really not convenient if one of us want to go outside, one of us have to standby at the room to open the door if any of us go. (Swimming, Breakfast, etc) 
2nd.. 
The air conditioner is not cold enough. They said we have to wait for 30 minutes approximately, so we waited but still the results is not what we expected. What a bummer.
Bali is the tropical island we all love but we do want to feel fresh and convenient when we go inside our room.
So we hope that the hotel will reflect on the discomfort we have experience."
We love the breakfast there
"Good hotel, near airport, helpful staff, I recommend this hotel"
"Location for this hotel is good, room is spacious, good swimming pool. The one is the worse is breakfast taste is bad, smallest variety of the food. I skip 2 of 4 times breakfast. I suggest to eat outside for breakfast. I suggest to buy room only without breakfast"
"I had to stay here again because my group were staying here. I had checked-in and was already staying at this hotel the night before for 3 nights (Friday to Monday), but on my 2nd day of stay (Saturday), I had to book a 2nd room for 1 night stay (Saturday to Sunday), the check-in process was still very slow.
I was checking-in at around 1830, the receptionist (Mr. Suardana) gave reasons that were unthinkable and unimaginable, from the booking was made just now, so it takes time for the reservation to come through to the hotel, we're still preparing the room (was the room left unprepared until it's booked?), we're still checking the room (was the room left unchecked for amenities and others when it's cleaned?). 
Roughly after 30 minutes of waiting, I got my keys brought up to one of the rooms I'm already staying. Still no improvements from my last stay here a few months ago."
"This is a small hotel for layovers. Nothing special with too many locals tourists and many big buses esp in the early hours.
Not many choices of food available surrounding the hotel. Mainly for local travellers. Breakfast mainly local dishes, nothing impressive and always full house with many local and sometimes can be very annoying with the loud sounds esp in the early hours!"
"1. Parking space very limited and no vallet services when crowded
2. Even we check in on 5.30 pm the room still not ready yet
3. Room cleaning also very late (4-6 pm). So when we came back to room (go out since 9 am) the cleaning process not done yet
4. Hot water not working,they said it's over crowded
5. Breakfast selection for 4 star hotel considered poor and less
6. Wifi in the room very slow and struggling even to stay connected
7. Tv channels are very few and not intereating to watch"
"The car park is terrible and not safe + far from lobby
The water is so fishy,. Also the trolly wheels are so noisy in front room every morning at 5-6 AM..."
"The Hotel upgrade my room
1. The room feels like has been cleaned several weeks ago, and my friend got locked inside the bathroom. 
2. Cant call receptionist because Phone didnt work
3. got only one key card , so i have to leave my room with open door .because if i take out the card, the room will getting dark and my friend stuck in the bathroom
4.after complaining, the technician try to open the bathroom, because its not simple 'stuck' door..the guy have to get his another tools to open the door. 
4. After my friend got out the room, im asking the guy to fix the phone..turns out, it broken completely so tbey have to change with another one
5. last one, the receptionist promise to change my room asap, but until the next morning the receptionist or even hotel staff come to my room. 
i have to leave the hotel early morning so i force my self to except the situation, but dear swissbell Tuban, you guys are the worst. this is my last time ever visit your hotel."
Why the hotelS team is allowed to shouting and moving the furnitures for some guests????? It’s is terrible noisy. Anyos not too bad option for this price
"Sayang sekali menginap di Swiss-Belhotel Tuban hanya satu malam, but since it was our last night in Bali, jadi closing trip yang sangat menyenangkan.. :) walaupun lokasinya aga masuk kedalem (ga di jalan raya utama) dan kedengeran suara geser2 kursi dr kamar diatasnya, kamarnya luas plus view poolnya yg sweet banget pas malem2, pelayanannya ramah dan cepat, ditambah birthday cake buat hubby ditengah malem yg diantar staff hotel ke kamar.. yeeaahh...thanks swiss-belhotel tuban.. it is our pleasure to spend the time in one of ur rooms.. ;)"
"A great hotel for stay and it excels in almost all area. Near to Airport and shopping areas in Kuta. Room is excellent and bright with all necessary amenities. We had the pool view room with nice balcony, which was nice to spend some lazy time. The pool was big. Restaurant food was good too with good buffet breakfast. The staffs were good & helpful. 
As it was a large hotel there were many guests, so sometimes it becomes crowded. but not a big problem. 
We enjoyed our stay at Swiss-Bel Tuban. And will consider to stay there again when we visit Bali."
"It's a excellent experience living here.Because the new room & amenities,staff all friendly and kindly and price is cheap!!!It's worth spent time in Swiss-Belhotel,the location was nearly Kuta Beach & Discovery Shopping Mall,only walk under than 10mins(about 1km) and not far from airport,just 10mins driving.If I have another trip here,I will choose it again!!!Awesome!!!!!!"
"huge pool with connected kids area and sunbeds on the water.  On a hot day, the pool is like a heated pool even late in the evening.  
two nice areas for breakfast, hint-ask for the upstairs location, quieter and with same food.
the bed is the standard Swiss-Belhotel - thick, with two big floppy pillows per person
the standard room is tight, so upgrade if you can.
there is a free shuttle to Discovery Mall, but if you can't be bother, just wave down a blue taxi, cost around 1 AU$ , if you book through the hotel, the min cost is $3 ."
the room awesome clean... the bed very comfy... but breakfast is damn lousy... buffet breakfast need to improve a lots on the quantity and quality...  it is very dissapointing to know that Swiss Bell Harbour Bay Batam buffet spread is much much better than Swiss Belhotel Tuban....
"Willing to go the extra mile for me and my family. Me and now hubby decided to have our wedding in Bali. Him and I thought to make a group booking for all family members that were attending. So close to Kuta shopping. Swissbel hotel turban is in located in Kuta, but not on the outskirts. 2-5 minute drive to central Kuta. Convenient that there were 2 shops directly across the road and a laundry mat costed us $15 to do practically all our clothes like a lot of clothes(cheaper doing laundry there, instead of hotel). Street food 30sec away on foot, restaurant at the hotel itself was so good, I regretted not going earlier. Room service.... well let me say the watermelon salad was so tasty my pallet danced on the first bite. So child friendly, the kids swam everyday( remember to buy sunblock) and I ordered lunch whilst swimming as the restaurant is 1 step from the pool:) Chinese New Years was a blast!!! Can’t get enough of the food. My hubby was impressed as he didn’t get Bali belly at all:)"
"Spend 5 days in this hotel along with my whole family members (include my parent and my two children), we had a very good memories. Even the location of this hotel is quite isolated from the main road but it is not a big deal for us. As it is not that far from the main road to Kuta Beach. For us it was a benefit as we went on the end of 2016 where Bali was becoming very crowded on that period. But as we stayed in Swiss Bel Tuban, we didn't need to pass the crowd area to reach our room :)
Overall we could say that we had a very pleasant stays there. The room is big, it occupied our family members well in each room. Also the facility is great. We love the pool, we love the ambience, we love the lobby, we love even our balcony in the room. The staff was also quite nice and helpful. We came earlier before the check in time, and they still could help us to find the rooms.
Even the food variety was not that much, some of it had just ordinary taste but it was satisfying enough. 
Me recommend this hotel. Also the kiddos would love to go back. :)
Hopes we can find another holiday to Bali, and will return again to this hotel."
"I stayed here at Swiss-Bel Hotel Tuban about a year ago and loved everything about this hotel. We booked in the poolside room and was upgraded to a family poolside room on arrival. The king bed was the best bed I have ever slept on which was good as I have a bad back. The staff were friendly and helpful, they run a free shuttle that drops you off at discovery shopping centre and picks you up to take you back. Food was nice but after 2 weeks would have been nice for more variety. The pool was a good decent size. Place was nice and quiet so you could relax during your holiday. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and will definitely be staying here again"
"I had a great experience during my visit at Swiss-Bel Surabaya, so when me and my friends visited Bali we choose Swiss-Bel again. And Swiss-Bel never disappoint me. The Swiss-Belhotel Tubas is big, with huge swimming pool and lots of beach chairs beside the pool, clean and cool rooms with balcony facing the pool, wide range of breakfast, staffs are all very responsive. Value for money is excellent (note that my visit is during low season time so it is normal to get cheap price). The downside is only the house keeping staff which clean my room everyday is not so clean and tidy."
"I don't have any con's for this time.
It was such a beautiful experience staying at swiss belhotel.  Friendly staff, always smiling and ready to help you anything. Food awesome but being vegetarian if we can get more option will be great. 
But highly recommend everyone best hotel, value for money
 Thank you"
We enjoyed the hotel facilities such as the pool and gym. Free shuttle available to Discovery Mall. Room was clean and spacious.  Hotel staff were friendly too. Overall great experience as this was our first time staying at Swiss-Belhotel.
Really enjoyed our stay at Swiss-BelHotel Tuban. Facilities and staff were great.
"My flight arrived in the midnight so I searched a hotel that is close to the Airport. Swiss-Belhotel is just about less than 15 minutes driving from the airport. It's a new hotel in town, opened just this year. Some part of the hotel is still under construction so you might hear some noise in the day, but it's absolutely quiet at night. The hotel is very clean, the staffs are very friendly. It's NOT located in the most crowed area, but it's just a few hundred meters away. The breakfast wasn't impressive, but pretty OK."
"Incredible value for a hotel that could be mistaken for a five-star reort based on looks alone.  The rooms won't blow you away but they're functional,  comfortable, and spacious.   Facilities are a coin toss - the pool is spectacular, the gym is shoddy, and the free breakfast is subpar.  The free wlecome drinks are a nice twist though.  Location-wsie, there are some local restaurants in the vicinity and it's <10 min. to the airport so probably better for a stopover.  And as you might expect in Bali, it will take you a while to get to any of the main tourist hotbeds like Seminyak, Kuta, Jimbaran, or Ubud."
"This hotel is only 1 year old, not far from the main road, easy access, hotels rooms great size, lovely decor.  The hotel is modern and well laid out.  The pool area is excellent, lots of variety for breakfast.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  I could not fault this hotel at all - very unusual so well done Swiiss-Bel Tuban."
"We stayed at many hotels in Bali before. 
Everything about the hotel was great . They staff were friendly and helpful. 
The rooms were clean. The area in the hotel was clean as well. 
Breakfast was okay , nothing special about it, not much of a variety. 
Location wise for us it was perfect. We could walk down towards Kuta in 10mins and in 15 we could reach legian."
"We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel. The location of the hotel is very strategic, the room is spacious and very clean. They also have a nice clean pool. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. We really appreciate Ms. Claudia who upgrade our room. She is very calm and  experienced in dealing with guests. We definitely will return to this hotel again if we visit Bali."
"Long before the experience of what occurred below my wife and could not believe how nice this hotel was for $46 USD - but we live in Phuket and do not visit Bali. After a weeks diving in Komodo we arrived for 1 night here stop over on the way to Phuket - I already had had an ear infection for 2 days - the flight to bali was uncomfortable but not too bad - but by midnight the pain was pretty bad - but more so the concern about flying the next day. I crept out of the room with out waking the wife and down to reception. they advised about a new hospital quite close, then drove me there - apologized they could not wait for me  - but gave me a business card and told me to ring when ready and they would pick me up - which they did - promptly. at no point walking to reception was I expecting that. Fantastic service I will never forget. thank you to Theo (more over his amazing team) was fantastic. We will be stopping by any time we are headed to Komodo again."
"The Swiss-Belhotel Tuban in Kuta, Bali, is one of a plethora of hotels in this area, and in my opinion, is nothing special. Also, they managed NOT to meet me at the airport as agreed; ended up phoning the hotel twice before being picked up."
"We stayed here with our 3 small children for 4 nights. While in Bali we stayed at 4 different resorts/hotels. The whole hotel was very nice and clean, the pool area was very good and there wasn’t enough to do for our small children.
The room we stayed in was very nice, clean and was very good value for money but was a little small for a family.
All staff were very friendly and helpful and were very good with our children.
The “kids club” wasn’t a kids club at all but was actually disgusting. There was mould growing all over the walls and it stank and it was never supervised. It was just a dark and dirty little room with a few toys.
Other than the kids club we enjoyed staying here as it was within walking distance to the Discovery Shopping Mall, Waterbom and some markets.
We would consider staying here again if needing to be near the airport."
"A GOOD HOTEL TO REST AND RECUPERATE  AWAY FROM THE MAIN SHOPPING AREA OF KUTA.  GOOD ROOMS, FRIENDLY EFFICIENT STAFF 
A GREAT PLACE TO STAY AWAY FROM THE MAIN DRAG OF KUTA WITH
FRIENDLY STAFF, CLEAN ROOMS
+MODERATE PRICES FOR FOOD AND DRINKS."
"Mix and match hotel of Balinese concept. Warm greeting by all staff most of the times.
We took early morning flight from Kuala Lumpur and very tired upon arrival but all that gone after receive sweet smile from Isha Nasution the receptionist. Our triple room was great and lovely.
Breakfast is superb with local and english cuisine. Very friendly waiter especially Cynthia, Bayu and Diah. Very knowledgeable about the dish and custom of Bali.
Housekeeping was great too and keep our room very clean everyday.
Bellboy also very friendly."
"Hotel was near to everything. Staffs were friendly but the breakfast buffet can be better :) over all, superb stay! 5/5"
10 minutes from airport and Kuta Beach
"Good service, clean room and near to the airport, good value for money, will come again"
"we have to make some confirmation by phone if we don't want to miss it, cannot just write down on the application when we did a booking"
I like this hotel.. staff very nice and friendly..
"Semuanya bagus,clean dan sangat strategis. It's a very very Good &Big Pillow on the Bed,comfort Room. Very Recommended Hotel!"
Decent enough for an overnight stay
"When we got there, the air conditioning did not work properly. I called them and within less than 20 mins they sent technicians to fix it. 
The room is clean, comfortable and spacious. Location wise is good and near the airport , supermarket and beach within walking distance. 
The staff are friendly and helpful.  
Highly recommended!"
"Its a Good Hotel with good View, Gym facilities not upto the mark and Food menu has limited options, but overall a good and safe stay."
"Hotel bersih, service bagus, mknan enak, staf ramah2 n helpfull, bs check in lbh awal, thx u Swiss bell hotel tuban kuta bali 👍👍"
"big and clean hotel.. above my expectation for its affordable price. service is great, always on standby for 24 hours. Room is not too small and just right for 2 persons. Would like to stay here again."
