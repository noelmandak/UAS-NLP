"The staff at the Royal Regantris made my stay.   I tried another hotel but stayed instead for almost two months.
I had a special breakfast cooked by the chief on my request.  
When there were problems,  two months is a long time.   The staff sorted it out quickly.
I felt to Hotel was good value and I would use it again if I return to Kuta Bali. 
I am traveling Asia and this is one of my favorite stays due to the friendly staff.
Any issues they fix fast and with kindness."
"This is one of the best choices made after evaluation of 20+ hotels.
Our budget was much higher but we choose to settle for this hotel after deliberation. And oh boy, what a wonderful steal.
Location - Right close to Kuta beach in the market. 5/5
Staff- Super friendly, haven't seen such hospitality before.
Pool and Rooms- Clean, hygienic.
Highly recommended"
"Our stay was good and comfortable. Rooms were great! So were the hotel facilities and the staff were polite.
Good spread of BF! Overall a very good and affordable stay at Kuta!"
We booked a suite and it was very nice. Staff was polite. Location was good as it was close to Kuta beach.
"Breakfast is nice. Value for money. Extra travel facilities provided are great and economical. If you want to book tours to Tanah lot, Ubud, Tirta Ganga, i would recommend asking for 2 drivers- Arcana and Norman. Both of them are great and really got co-travellers"
"Royal Singosari Kuta is one of the best hotels that we have stayed in. The suite is excellent for a couple and the sitting room made our stay even better. Also, we recommend the restaurant; the food was excellent.
Overall Royal Singosari Kuta was excellent value for money.
I make special comment about the staff:
- We were able to communicate in both Indonesian and English.
- The staff were always polite and generous with their time when giving us information.
- The service was great.
Thank you all for a pleasant stay at Royal Singosari Kuta."
"Royal regantris is the perfect option for a good stay in bali had basement parking and terrace pool.rooms are clean and big enough
Overall I suggest this place"
Great place to stay value for money has everything you want and is in a great location with many bars and restaurants around
Overall the stay was very comfortable. Good room. Breakfast was mediocre (but I guess that's what they can give at such low cost).It's located in heart of Kota. Beach and restaurants are at walking distance. Overall I would recommend this hotel and would definitely choose to stay here if visit Bali again considering the value for money and good rooms.
"You can keep looking and looking but after trying several hotels in the area I'm telling you this hotel is a gem.
All hotels in the area have poor facilities, except this one. Clean rooms, neat pool on the roof top, beautiful view, reasonably priced menu, genuinely neat staff.
If I come back, I make sure to book their rooms!"
We travelled as a group and the location was great spa across the road Sara’s also great. Can’t complain good value for money
"What a lovely hotel to spend our holiday. 
The place was really strategic and near the beach. The room was large and cleaned everyday. 
The staff here are excellent. 
Thank you so much for your hospitality, especially for my birthday cake surprise."
"We got this room during sale and when we arrived, it was better than in the pics. Location was great, staff were friendly. The pool was smaller than I thought though. Nevertheless, it was really comfortable staying here."
"Nice location and cheap price 
The breakfast is tasty 
Worth it"
"Wonderful experience with the staff and I extremely recommended for the breakfast included with room booking .
Love to visit again ."
"Great hotel, the room was clean. Foods are good."
"Good location, really clean room and friendly staffs. Highly recommend for this hotel. I'll be back this hotel in the future."
"Okay, after finishing our stayat other hotels, I can say that this place was really worth the price.
Pros: great AC, good fridge, good hot water, good bathtub, clean rooms, great wifi, great breakfast compared to others with promo in this pandemic season, great pool.
Cons: aisles too dark, pools bar was closed."
"Very good location if you like to stay in Kuta. Older hotel but very clean room and the staff are very welcoming and friendly, buffet breakfast is delicious also. Definitely Worth staying here."
This place is soo nice staff are so helpful and accommodating the pool is soo good cannot believe how cheap it was! Thank you for having us
Great staff location excellent nice rooms lift from car/bike parking in basement to your floor
"Large bed,spacious room,bathtub, able to work and very quiet so i can join online meeting with no worries..
Windows works so i can get some air nd wind when am not using the ac
Overall suits what i need so am satisfied"
"The hotel is near Kuta beach, within walkable distance to Discovery mall and beach walk,
- Lot of places to try local food. 
- Hotel rooms are very clean
- Rooftop pool but not so big, depth 95-110cm
- We booked along with breakfast, the breakfast area is smaller compared to the rooms  and guests
-  sometimes foods are finished quickly, so had to wait for some time to refill.
Overall great hotel with this price and location."
We were so happy to found this hotel by online booking. We got the cheapest price and got a big room and clean. I will recommend this hotwl for you and my friends. Worth it.
All was perfect and there were no insects in the room! That's a seldom for Bali
Clean  room n good location hotel.  Hot Water working very well. Very nice crew staffs hotel. Pool on roof top very nice and great viwe
"Staff is the kindest and most genuine. I've stayed at plenty of hotels in Bali and this hotel is the best for value.
Prices are straight forward and no hidden costs.
Definitely will come back here!"
The stay was really awsom and we could enjoy the property to the fullest for a minimal cost. Thanks Agoda and thanks royal regantris.
"It's a budget hotel, not a Banyan Tree.  However, it is super-clean and the staff is exceptional.  On an odd little street, but centrally located to EVERYTHING in Kuta ... 500m from the main Kuta beach.  So much going on around here, but still surprisingly quiet.  Ask for the Temple-View room on the 5th floor (505) ;-)"
"pleasant stay with good staff. nice decent room , with beautiful simple garden balcony .
need to improve on the breakfast , however everything was good ."
The place was really strategic and near from the beach.  The room was large and clean. The staff was very nice and helpful.
"Gear location, amazing service.  Well above the price paid (~$25AUD/night) make sure to have a conversation with Tude, the general manager. Amazing gentleman!"
Perfect stay in Kuta. The hotel suprised us with the big room and cleanest room. My children loves it too. Great price and full hospitality
"I had a great time here. the staffs were so nice and so helpful. the room that I had is superb. but perhaps a little word of advice for the management is that you should clean the pool more often and thoroughly, b'cos inside the pool was slippery since there were moss and mildew here and there, my friend was almost slipped because of it. but luckily he wasn't injured. Despite of this, I enjoyed my time and had a wonderful leisure time there."
all staff are nice and helpful .
"The location is strategic and is a walking distance to everything you might need (Kuta Beach, Convenience Stores, Fast Foods, ATM, Sourvenir Shops, Massage Parlor, Tattoo/Piercing Shops, etc.). Cons is that it is prone to traffic at night around 7-9PM as the place is located to a 1-way road.
The Staffs are also accomodating and approachable. They will always smile and greet you."
"Great location, walking distance to the Mall and the Kuta Beach. Lots of Massage places around hotel and also the Souvenir stalls.
Friendly staffs, cheap on prices, the only thing was, the rokm that we were on lv 1, had strong mould smell which they denied at first when we complaint, i had to tell the HR lady, which able to assist us to move us to other level when we came back fir the second stay. Nice swimming pool, and good overall budget but quality hotel"
"I stayed 2 nights, and it was awesome… one of their guest service assistant, Ayu (if i am not mistaken) the one who handle us when we checked in and checked out, she is superb… always calling me with my name, and fulfill our needs efficiently… not only her, all of their staff has great hospitality…  Thank you Royal Regentrist.. look forward to stay with u in other time… 😁😁"
"Good location, great staff. They upgraded my room upon check in. Love the hotel. Will definitely stay here again!"
"5 minute walk to  the beach, great rootop pool, friendly staffs. There is a great grill restaurant near the hotel. A good money exchange rate booth next to the hotel. There is not much choice for breakfast but you should include breakfast in your booking because the restaurants near hotel are super crowed."
"Very nice facilities specially buffet breakfast,  rooms also nice with amenities."
"Good hotel with reasonable rates. Friendly staff, good view from rooftop swimming pool. Nice food. Located in the heart of Kuta. 3 minutes walk to Kuta beach."
One of my best stays in Bali. Love this hotel and the staff!
"Spacious room, bath tub, free wifi, beautiful swimming pool, breakfast available, very close to airport.  Most important very competitive price."
"near the beach. there's a stain on the floor in the room when i stay and the refrigerator cabinet was hot from the fridge's heat release. other than that, this hotel is perfect. comfortable, strategic, staffs are quite nice. i didn't check the pool when i stay but there is one."
It is the best budget hotel with a great facility and location. Highly recommended to choose for staying in Kuta
Rooftop swimming pool is good and they have snack at night. Generally good value for the price
The hotel is on a wide road and many local shops are around. All the benefits mentioned on Agoda were there. Recommend to stay.
"The location is very good, walk distance to  Kuta beach, indomaret and a lot of spa massage along the street. Hotel facility is great, bathtub, hair dryer, double pillow per person, etc. The down side are the breakfast taste not good and cannot late checkout (the staff said will apply fine 100k for checkout after 12, so mean)"
"Pelayanan, kamar makanan semua goodd bakalan balik ksni lg"
"walking ditance to all restaurants, beach, and shops"
Room amazing very clean and friendly staff
I enjoy stay in this place the staff also friendly gave a good service.
Best hotel of all. We enjoy our stay a lot!
My favourite thing about the hotel is the pool. It's on the roof so it is super peaceful. The rest of the hotel is very nice and the staff are always friendly.
"Hotel bnr2 sesuai namanya, Royal... Fasilitasnya jg royal.."
Great staff and the food is wonderful. We couldn't ask for better breakfasts. Lots of variety and tasty too.
Very Good Services
"room was nice, welcome drink tastes good and unique, we allowed to early check-in. breakfast not many variations may be cause by pandemic but the taste was good. we've got the first floor room, there are some mosquito in the room, despite mosquito overall was good. thanks"
"this hotel located not far from kuta beach,kuta square,kute street .easy to move from one place to another just by walk.love the pool"
We got recommended this hotel bye my brother we were so amazed with the staff the rooms are great and not far from beach and shopping strip
"good hotel, bikin good mood. cool. pengertian dengan dompet budget"
Location was excellent. You can walk to get to the beach. And the hotel price was very affordable. Will book again in this hotel. :)
Near from kuta beach. Good location
Perfect location close to everything and such wonderful helpful caring staff. It truly feels like home.
"This is a fantastic location and has many handy shops around it. I had a suite with separate lounge room which I loved, the decor and furnishings are a little dated and could probably do with an overhaul. The staff are super friendly and helpful but the place itself seems to have had problems with construction. Quite a few people complaining about water leaks in their rooms including myself. The rooftop pool is great but lacks atmosphere as the bar remains closed after covid I assume and there always seems to be workers fixing something up there. I got this hotel at a great price, so for me it was great value for my buck but if you are a fussy person its probably not the hotel for you."
"Closed to Kuta Beach, and excellent hotel with the prices and good breakfast"
I ❤the location anda the pool❤❤🙌🙌
The hotel and amenities are good overall. The location is a plus. Very close to Kuta beach and other hotspots. Staff is very humble and kind.
The hotel is good. All the service are provided during this covid pandemic
Perfect location. Near to everything
Perfect location. Near to everything
Perfect location. Near to everything
"Nearest to shopping souvenir,bank, n mini market. Easy to get there. I just walking around to shopping souvenir."
I love this hotel.
It's perfect. I LOVE IT
"Very good value hotel. Great staff kind, friendly and helpful. Good quality room very comfy bed. Excellent roof top pool.
Some parts are a little faded but generally very good. Buffet breakfast a little lacking. 5 minutes to beach etc."
Value for money
"beach, mini market, food are all in walking distance. Spacious room, cool rooftop pool, nice staff."
They have kiblat pointers in all rooms. Warm swimming pool. They don't serve pork in the menu.
The only drawback was the washroom. It's a bit dated.
"That is great hotel in kuta because in that price they provide all the services like bathtub , refrigerator , city view and pools . It’s center in Kuta so everything is so near to the hotel ."
"beach, minimarket, food are all walking distance. Spacious room, cool rooftop pool, nice staff."
"The hotel is really very good... Awesome breakfast buffet, good location,staffsare also very good... Rooftop pool is also very nice... Worth staying..."
If you're looking to find a genuine place to stay near airport - this is the one with great rooms & essential amenities. The only problem was breakfast - they don't offer appropriate breakfast options & there was an episode where we faced some issue with the cleanliness of the breakfast - there were flies all around the salad & fruits
Good staff
"Best budget stay during pandemic, near kuta beach"
"A good location with mini markets right next door or across the road.
Well appointed rooms, particularly for the price.
Good breakfast and helpful staff.
Would happily stay again"
"Good place, quiet at nite"
Really awesome hotel and worth for money.
Easily accessible to the beach and restaurants. The facilities are also superb.
Sangat direkomendasikan
Good service!!
A little unorganized at check in but overall a good stay. Very friendly staff. A bit loud from the people above but that’s common. The one in Kuta is great but DO NOT STAY AT ROYAL REGANTRIS IN SURABAYA. Very rude staff and not accommodating.
Had the restaurant closed over Christmas with no prior warning
"The hotel is very good, nice pool and very friendly staff."
"So far so good,staff ramah..macet sore hari"
"It was good experience staying here. I stayed here for 3 nights. Everything just fine. The room was clean, the staffs were friendly. The breakfast needs improvement, the taste was so so. But the restaurant food was affordable."
"Lovely Balinese staff, great value, love the rooftop pool."
The best 👍👍👍👍👍
"Stayed for 3 nights, very late check in, no problem at all.
Got a suite room, apart from being a bit tired, it was great, breakfast was more Asian than European, mattress was great.
Staff couldn't do enough for you, so pleasant, location very handy too"
"Undoubtedly more bang for you buck, the property location, comfort, facilities, staff, food, pricing were all top notch. Surely not a spanking new hotel, a bit dated in more ways than one but passable. The one sore point was the hotch potch house keeping, almost missed out something every single day, not to mention the locker which couldn't be fixed inspite of 2 replacements, and I decided I had enough of it right aft check in and locked up my stuff in my suitcase. The bathroom gets totally water logged after every shower, a design issue, could get irritating at times. But all in all a definite recommend for the budget conscious."
"The location is good, maybe 8-10mins walk to Kuta beach. Mcdo and Yoshinoya is near and there are different convenient stores nearby. Hotel is a bit old but still clean. They clean my room every day. Still recommended if you want to stay in Kuta and near the airport"
"Quite good, the front desk is super smart and made my stay very enjoyable"
I have stayed at this hotel many times and love it.  The location to everything is great. The staff are always friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet is excellent.
"recommended hotel, we stay for 7 days but feel like at home, no issue at all."
"In close proximity to mini marts and cafes plus away from the main night life strip.
Comfortable rooms, reasonable breakfast and generally helpful staff."
Good area......close to everywhere 👍👍
Great parking if you have a car or bike lift very handy
Very good hotel
"Staff very polite and helpfull, location is near from kuta beach and kuta shoping area"
"Yeah, get what you pay for, clean but tired place, great staff in the main, breakfast average"
"We stayed there for 2 nights and we arrived around 3pm, little bit surprised when we were told to get our welcome drinks next day and breakfast will be ready at 9 am. Parking at the basement is limited, once our car was blocked and the staff can't really help even they have the key bcz he can't drive. The stairs to the rooftop pool is lil bit creepy. Although the room is superb, very clean and spacious. Good value for money. Over all it was a good stay, can be improved."
Everything are ok
Good staff and great location
"Staff are nice, suitable for staying some days, everything is good.... Like this place"
"Good location within a congested market area, but near to main road. Parking (both basement & on street) is also quite spacious.  Breakfast was sumptuous (for the price), service was fast. Cleanliness is ok but can be a notch better. Staffs are really very helpful.
Overall value for money."
All I can really say is for the 1 night we stayed there is was a very nice stay. Rooms need a little refreshing due to to long Covid shutdown. But the staff was great I would not hesitate staying here again
Staff go above and beyond. Had a great stay :)
"Staff, food, location and amenities are excellent except for the toilet in the room as it has a foul odor smell coming from the toilet upon arrival until we checked out."
