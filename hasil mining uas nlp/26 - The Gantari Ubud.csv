"First Things First the rooms are large,clean and modern.The pool was cleaned daily.The week i was there it was raining cats and dogs but the cleaning staff were on their duty to make all the guests comfortable.Front office staff were fantastic.Special mentions to Valen and Gustra. The Hotel is situated right in the heart of ubud.All your activities start from ubud.If you stay in kuta,seminyak,jimbaran,dua etc it adds an easy 1-2 hrs of extra travel.No Mosquitoes were found in the property.I was about to leave to singapore and suddenly realised that my russian vaccine wasn’t accepted for a VFTF and i needed a pcr test and it was already 10:00 pm here in bali.I approached them asking for help for which within 15 mins there was lab tech at the lobby waiting to take my swab.By the next morning the result was ready printed and was handed over to me during the check out.Finally Great Staff,Large Modern Rooms,Close to activities and affordable pricing make this hotel a must stay if you are in bali.A 5/5 for me."
"When we entered the room, we were stunned by how big is the room!!! It was soo big and pretty (even better than picture). The room was very clean, even the bathtub is sparkling clean. Location is near main road so we dont have any problem going out at night. The staff was also amazingly nice and friendly. Thank you!! We definitely will be staying here again"
"I really enjoyed staying here. The room is spacious and clean. The staff was really nice and helpful. Although the location is a little remote, but nothing a rental car cannot fix. The scenery from our room was breathtaking. Would recommend staying here for anyone looking for affordable luxury accommodation in Bali 👌🏻"
"The place was beautiful, great location, The room is very spacious, clean and comfortable. They have a big TV's screen with netflix. The staff were amazing,  and all the services were above and beyond. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it, worth every penny! we can't wait for the next visit :)"
"It's my first place to stay when I got to Bali. Everything's just on point: the room, the bathtub, how mirrors are set, the pool, the friendly staffs, the water pressure and especially no mosquitoes 👏👏 it's not in the crowded part of Ubud but also not too far, which is perfect for someone who needs a bit of solitary like me. There are some wonderful warungs nearby too. Definitely stay here again in the future. I wish you all the best ♥️"
"There was nothing wrong ! The staff were extremely friendly, helped us check in, the food was excellent, the rooms were spotless and clean. The bed was GIGANTIC!! and very nice to sleep on, there were no foul smells or excess noise. The entirety of the resort was truly peaceful with nothing to disturb you. 
Enter the room and you will be surprised at how grandiose, large and spacious the room is. With clear access to your balcony, your very own private bathroom with a lovely and solid bathtub. Everything was perfect, I can't wait to go back."
"It’s a lovely & quiet place a little ways away from Ubud centre. 
The staff were super friendly. 
Got a room upgrade for my birthday trip — lovely surprise. 
Do note that it is located next to a school so you’ll likely hear some singing and cheery kids in the morning on weekdays. It was definitely helpful with resetting my body clock tho! 😂"
"Stayed here for at least a few nights. Staffs are friendly, resort itself is clean especially the rooms. I think this resort has some influencers staying. (From Youtube etc) Definitely will recommend."
"Such a lovely place. Can't recommend enough.
Pros:
1) Spacious rooms, beautiful ambience. 
2) New property with excellent room amenities. The smart TV even comes with Netflix subscription. 
3) Lovely, well maintained swimming pool
4) Courteous staffs.
Could be improved: 
1) There was a foul smell due to improper drainage in the toilets in our room(no..107). Feedback was given, hope they correct the same.
2) Breakfast time starts late. We suggest it could start early by 7am, since most tourists plan sightseeing trips early in the morning."
I’m from Malaysia. This hotel is so comfortable. Very recommended. The receptionist is so kind and very helpful
"I really enjoy stay here after busy life in kuta and seminyak .. 
The staff are super kind and the also after 2 weeks stay in bali and moving from place to another place this hotel is the cleanest among all and I wish I could stay longer. 
Thank you againz"
"Nice new hotel in Ubud area. It's near ATV and rafting area so the location is great and easy to find. Perfect for staycation also. The room is spacious with great decoration, have smart tv, all room have balconny so it's perfect to just chill and enjoy the tranquility of Ubud. Only downside, they don't have big dining place but I ate in my room balcony so it's okay. And their dropoff is narrow, so cars can only backoff after dropping people in the lobby."
I had exceptional fun time experience in Gantari. The room we got was spacious and lovely. The breakfast included in section 9 Cafe was great. Nice coffee and all day breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back.
"I can't describe enough how satisfied we are. Super clean, friendly staff, nice location, quiet surroundings, and many more! If I would have a chance to go back to Bali, I'd still choose Gantari Ubud. I have nothing to complain. Thank you for the exceptional service!"
"Excellent staff. Clean big rooms. Quiet area but only 10 minutes from Ubud center.
One of the best hotel experiences I ever had."
"Love the big, clean, new room.  Beautiful room.
Wahyu went all way to assist you.  Sad didnt got the chance to say goodbye to him."
"The room is very large and spacious, my daughter is very happy because she can watch tv from the bathtub
The swimming pool is very nice, and the staff is very nice too. They informed you many great places in ubud that recommended to visit 
Thank you for wonderful hotel. I will come again with my family. Great hotel, great experience"
"This Villa located 5km from center of Ubud, very quite at night but  a little bit noisy at day because near of school, buat the room insulation can provide quiteness if you shut the door off. The room is big, has a desk to work, and lazy sofa at the terrace. The water is clear and has a good stream. Nice bathtube design too. Really recommend"
"Very good location. 3km from the centre. We had a room by the pool, not many using the pool so not disturbing at all. The room was nicely furnished and spacious with open bathroom (with curtains). Very relaxing, feels like home. Decent price and fantastic staff. We’ll definitely come back the next time we’re in Ubud."
"The weather has been quite warm lately, so Mom & I decided to spend the night up North in Ubud. We booked The Gantari Ubud an hour prior to arrival & were impressed with the room size + amenities! The twin beds were more like a double size bed each, it was fun to chill in the swing on the porch & 1 could watch the TV from the bathtub. Trust me, it wasn't easy for us to leave this hidden gem in Sayan the next day. We'll definitely come back!"
"Nothing to say more than this is an excellent hotel especially for couples.
It is quite and clean.
Nevertheless, the staff are the best.
You will not regret it."
"Tia, valen, Wahyu, Komang were amazing and the place was Delightful. I reallllllly enjoyed my stay
Suksema"
"Very new complex but well worth the the money 
I had the downstairs pool access would definitely recommend 
Large room amazing bathroom
The bed excellent very comfortable not the normal hard bed 
Tucked  away surrounded by temples very quiet and private 
Spend 3 days here definitely could have stayed longer 
Staff very friendly and nothing was to much trouble for them 
Highly recommend 5 plus"
Everything was just perfect! Highly recommend for those who want to stay quiet and relaxed.
"Spacious room , big bed and marvellous bathroom with pool view...amazing accomodation so far while our stay in Bali"
"We stayed 2 nights for our honeymoon..
We booked the whole villa with private pool..
Everything was good..the villa was still new and very clean..
Hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful.
But you need to be careful during rainy season because it’s very slippery..
Overall we were very satisfied and will definitely come back to this place"
"The gantari ubud is very nice and comfortable, if I go to Bali again I will stay in here again"
"Great Hotel, AWESOME CLEANLINESS AND BIG ROOM FOR 3 PERSON ( 10 YR KIDS). VERY COMFY BED AND IN THE MORNING YOU CAN HEAR THE NATURE MUSIC FROM TREE INSECT. 
OVERALL 9.5/10"
Room is spacious and clean. Staff is excellent. Quiet location at night. Fast internet. Plenty of hot water. Easy to book grab to go anywhere else.
"I had a amazing stay there.
The room is big and spacious, they have a big bathtub.
The only concern of my stay is my room is next to a elementary school so it was quite noisy at 7am.
You can request for a room that's not directly adjacent to the school
Overall I had a great stay there! Highly recommended!"
"3 Nights Stay at gantari ubud, this place is best for staycation and healing. 
But breakfast only have 4 menus. 
1. American breakfast
2. Fried rice
3. Mee goreng
4. Balinese rice. 
Breakfast come very slow"
"spacious room with very good facilities. i love their bathroom, i can shower for hours while watching. I will back to this place for vacation again!!"
We stayed here for two nights and will definitely return. The rooms are very large and spacious and kept clean. All the staff are very kind and helpful. The location is outside the busy center of ubud but if you have a motorbike its very easy to travel out and about. Great cozy and comfortable hotel. Highly recommend.
"In summary the hotel is very excellent compared to others. Luxury and spacious and quiet. 
The Staff are very friendly and helpful.
Best regards to all staff especially Ari."
"Hidden gem, the room is sooo bigg and spacious. Bed also extrabig can fit for 3 persons. Clean and smells good. We stayed in second floor pool view. Easy access to Hotel and great service"
What an amazing stay!!. Wished to stay here for a longer time. The room had everything you can dream of.
All is Perfect !!! Suka semua bener2 hidden gem di Ubud
"Best price and indeed cozy and big room.  The ambiance and the composition of our room is just perfect, best for staycation."
"Spacious room, very extremely clean , complete amenities… 10 thumbs"
I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in malaysia but this hotel is the best of all for the money. Would cm back here again
The staff were friendly and helpful. The room is big and clean. Would recommend to stay here.
"We spent 6 nights in our one bedroom Villa. Cozy forniture with fancy details, a beautiful and very colored garden around our private pool and open-air bathroom. 
A HUGE bedroom with comfortable pillows. 
Only a suggestion for the structure: if it’s possibile to anticipate the start breakfast time before 8am."
"A very very recomended hotel. In the middle of the village. A very large room with remarkable room facilities and very nice staff. When you need staycation, this hotel is a perfect place."
"Room is big,staff superb!!Everything is lovely definitely come back again"
"The room is spacious. The staff are nice.
Fridge is provided.
Some drawbacks though: no restaurant inside the hotel, but they're ok for food delivery application orders. And a bit out of Ubud center."
"New hotel, clean, spacious room, nice staffs"
Perfect place to stay..room is big and realy nice..the staff is great..bli wahyu help me a lot with everything.. thank you gantari..will be back for sure
100% excellent service. Excellent facilities. Perfect place to chill. Highly recommended
It was a nice stay at Gantari Ubud
"The staff  is very helpfull and polite, the room is spacious, very large bed, clean and smells very good 😃😃. The ala carte breakfast is taste good also.. overall, we have a very nice and memorable stay here..  im so happy that we choose The Gantari Ubud to stay.. ❤❤"
Kamar sangat besar dan bersih. Staff sangat sangat friendly. Suasana sangat tenang dan relax. Very recommend! Will come back soon.
I really enjoyed my week here. Beautiful property. The king size bed was so comfortable! Everything in the room is high end. I’d planned to stay another week but decided it was time to rent a monthly villa instead.
Loved every moment I would rate this 10/10 everything was amazing
The breakfast portion is too minute for adult but the rest is superb!!!!
"Great facility, great interior, great location, and great value. 
Room for improvements: 
- Seems understaffed
- Breakfast could be improved (very basic)
- Often ran out of drinking water in the night (I might drink more)
- Sewer smell issue in the room (hope they got this fixed very soon)"
"The property is one of a kind, all the facilities are modern and less than a year old.
The staff is absolutely incredible and represent the balinese culture.
Stayed here for 3 days but wished could have stayed longer!
A little far from the ubud center, still highly recommended!"
The location is a little out of the way but it’s charm is fantastic. A 10 minute Gojek ride has you in the heart of ubud. The room and staff were 5star. Staff were incredibly helpful. We will be going back but for longer this time. It’s was a great place to start our holiday.
"We loved our stay here! Our room was amazing and the staff also. Whenever we needed something, they were always there to help. I will for sure stay here again when I am back in Ubud!"
"Value for money, very big room and bathroom, nicely decorated, pool was awesome, staff was incredibly helpful. Will definitely come back."
Its so luxury..i love alls...the bathroom..the bed room..everything..so good...
"Exquisite room, cloudy comfy bed, beautiful swimming pool, very clean (our beds were made daily, washroom cleaned daily too), extremely friendly and helpful staff!! The only low was waking up early to playful screaming kids in the morning as there is a school on the other side of the wall! But it’s definitely worth it for all the comfort we’ve had! Plus, free Netflix :D"
The staff is helpful and friendly.
"We spent a very good week at The Gantari, the place is beautiful.
Wahyu and the rest of the staff were very nice and helpful.
The bed was HUGE, an so comfortable, the rooms generally were spacious and comfortable to say the least.
Will definitely visit again when we come back to Ubud 👍"
"Had a great stay, the staff was very friendly as well."
This place is absolutely amazing! 🫶🏻
"All is 5 stars..
The staff..soo friendly."
"Very good vila for the price.   It’s quiet and is around 15-20 mins away from town which is not an issue as you can just grab over. 
Enjoyed my stay over there.  Lovely staff.  Can’t ask for more with the value for money price that we paid."
This hotel is very nice
"really like this hotel! the room is so big and clean, the staff was lovely, everything is perfect.. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Perfect value for money stays, very clean and very aesthetic. We were on our honeymoon and it was the best stay. 
Services are a bit average but property and stay is very cozy and nice"
"The rooms were big and clean and comfortable. Really comfortable bed and the pillows are the best. Staff is very kind, accommodating and friendly.  Very nicely kept grounds and beautiful pool area. Big, open shower and bathtub. The only issue is there’s constant noise. No soundproofing within the rooms, you hear everything from neighbours, to roosters, to the school in behind and if you’re on the bottom floor you hear the people above stomping around. It’s unfortunate because everything else is amazing!"
"Staff sangat baik, ramah, helpfull..bersih"
"Very nice room, spacious with nice decoration... Bathroom is my child favorite, with the big tub.."
"Room really nice and clean. But when i stay, there is rat inside the room. Hope the housekeeping always close the door when cleaning."
Great interior and ambience
"Good hotel, pretty straightforward, no gym or spa, no shops, but a lovely pool and huge beautiful rooms set in a lovely surrounding although a bit far from the center of Ubud.
Breakfast is a bit dull, but served with a smile, too bad there is no restaurant available ,..
Very friendly staff makes up for most of it..and the hotel garden is second to none.
Located next to a school with noisy kids during class hours,was disturbing at times."
They have probably the comfiest bed for a hotel within the price range. The villa was lovely and the amenities were all great. The floor can be quite slippery when it rains though.
The room so specious & very cleaning staff is so nice and can recommend local spa in the room!!
"We stayed in one of the private pool villas. Definitely worth it. We loved the location, close enough to the shops and restaurants of Ubud but in a charming local Balinese village. 
Pros: Well located, peaceful, private pool villa is secluded, really beautiful room - clearly pretty brand new. 
Cons: Breakfast isn’t amazing, no fresh coffee or milk. There’s a little bit of noise from a primary school nearby.
Would definitely recommend this place and would look forward to returning."
"Had a splendid stay there, the room is huge and beautifully decorated, felt like staying at a five star hotel! The location is also charming, situated at a quite neighborhood in Sayan, Ubud. Also, last but not least,  thank you so much for the hotel staffs that are just so warm and friendly. They got 20room in total, so u got any corporate event or big family gathering? Hit them up!"
"If you like a quiet location a few miles from the town center, this is the place for you. Large rooms and new facilities, clean surrounding neighborhood, kind staff, affordable rates. Really enjoyed the area."
"We stayed at the villa for two nights, spacious room with smart high res tv to link with Netflix / primetv/ YouTube. Love the outdoor bathtub and shower, breakfast was good and staffs are super attentive. my wife got the in call masseurs for 2 consecutive nights with min price. Only setback is the location quite a distance from center, but getting grab bike is not an issue at all. Highly recommended for quiet and relax stay with family."
"This a great place if you want to relax. Not much to do around the area, but Villa was very spacious, clean, offered netflix/prime  and had a private pool. The staff was very helpful, the breakfast was great (but sometimes a little late), and they offered laundry services.  Overall, I’d recommend it for a lazy getaway or a more remote Villa. Also, Ubud center is about a 15-20 min drive so it’s not so bad a commute."
"The room is very spacious and clean. Very worth it for the price we paid. 
Location was abit hard to find, drivers had a hard time finding the place."
"Stayed in a private pool villa #305. The place seems new. Staff is excellent. Walls are thin, I could hear the neighbors talk, have sex, and party. The location is a bit far from the center. No great nearby restaurants or cafes. The streets are dark at night, didn’t feel safe walking with the dogs barking at you. 
Hard to catch Gojek or Grab for those who doesn’t operate scooters like myself. Grab app doesn’t recognize “The Gantari Ubud” and selects it as “The Gayatri” so you’re constantly being picked up/dropped off at gayatri. Use Gojek if you can since it recognizes this location. 
The place is great but if you want to be near walking distance to shops and restaurants or at least be able to catch Gojek or Grab in the evening, then choose another place."
Have spacious room and many facilities. Breakfast need a bit improvement
"Nice hotel, they decorated with nature look.
The room is big and very comfy.
They provide smart TV for entertainment.
The pool is also nice.
But, The parking slot is very limited and breakfast is also limited, need to book 1 day earlier.
Overall it was a nice stay."
"It was complete relaxation. The room was so grand for the amount its worth, the bathtub the balcony the bed and everything was worth nesting in for. The room alone is good for some mental unwinding or couples travelling to spent quality time together. 
Its hard to leave the room. Ive had the most pleasant abd memorable de-stressing stay there"
"Everything was excellent, thanks"
"This villa had so much potential. Everything would've been perfect but the room smelled bad. I initially thought it was a weird herbal scent and tried to get over it but the stench was coming from the bathroom, especially the toilet stall. As much as I wanted to air out the room, I couldn't because the bugs. If they resolved the room smell, I would 100% recommend this villa to everyone."
Good all the time. We will back
A small boutique hotel with spacious and nice room but maintanance should be improved in the bathroom area. Location not far from city center and have a nice ambience.
"This is a super clean place, a little way from the hustle bustle of things. A very nice area for walking around."
"I stayed there for 2 nights. The room with private pool is super nice, as well as the staffs, all are helpful."
Room are nice. But need pest control. Since there are rat inside the room
"Excellent place but a bit far out from Ubud's centre. The room was clean and had a great smell. We called for room service a few times but it was relatively slow - We observed that it was one concierge staff manning all the calls and delivery of food (maybe we are wrong). Regardless, it was a great experience and they have Netflix programmed on the TV! Great place if you just want to chill in Bali ~"
Fantastic staff met all our needs.
"Spacious bedrooms , but far from ubud centre but there is nothing a rental scooter can’t cover .
Staff were polite and good . Tia was also a great reception and helped us in scooter rental and other tourist activities. We planned our birthday there as well and the staffs were very kind and helpful"
"I booked Pool View and Pool Access Rooms for 4 pax. Pool View room is at 2nd level while Pool Access Rooms located at ground floor directly in front of the pool. What I love most during my stay was their super king bed and beautiful bathroom with big bath tub. I hope they could maintain this property better  especially with the mold smell in Pool Access Room. They tried to use UV and air refreshener but it was not working. There was some water bloom on the wall which may be the cause of the mold. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay @ Gantari."
It’s a good stay and the staff is super friendly. Breakfast options are good as well. Villas are quite big and clean. Villas have private pools. For some reason there is no universal adapter provided in the room which should be done in Bali. Apart from that everything is good and worth going.
"Plus: Great room and facilities. Friendly staff as well! 
Minus: secluded location and limited food/attractions nearby"
"Room was very spacious, staff were very helpful"
"Beautiful rooms and friendly staff. Not much else by way of bar or restaurant on site. 
Major point to note. There is a primary school right next door and you’ll hear children from 7am! 
Light sleepers be warned."
"It’s a small hotel but our room was beautiful and clean. Toilet smelled a little but I think that’s normal in Bali. 
The free breakfast was a little disappointing but the bed was the most comfortable out of all the hotels I stayed in Bali. 
Lovely staff and atmosphere :)"
Stayed here for 3 nights. Room size very spacious and have a nice decoration. Breakfast ok and staff is very nice. But need to improve for the bathroom cleanliness and please aware that school beside the hotel building. It is very noisy during day time. Feel a bit uncomfortable.
"This hotel location around 10-15 minutes driving from Ubud City Center.  Easy access with limited parking area. The building looks new, the room is very big and comfort with big and clean bathroom.  The room in the ground floor have direct access to the pool, nice and kids friendly pool. But for the breakfast there are only 2 set of menu, local or western style, not much option and needs time to prepare."
"Big room ,  very new room.
Only thing is it’s beside a school and the chicken crowing. But other than that , we love the place."
"Hotel is pretty new so furnishing and room interior is still in good condition.  Our room was just next to school so we hear school children st the canteen and assembly,
Chamber maid should be given a checklist to ensure that everything is done according to"
"Next room party from 17.00-06.30 using karaoke microphone all night. I have never once make a noise complain in my life, that day I call reception 3 times 00.00,02.00,04.00 and come to show them the video clip recorded in my room at 05.00 again. Noise never reduce untill they left at 06.30"
"Given the private pool and bath tub, and the big spacious area, better to plan your day to spend more time at the villa. Given that these facilities are all located outdoor, you have to expect a grassy, some sand / mud along the way and path. And with all the floras you got to expect insects and lizards too. Overall they provided a good experience, very big TV with smart features to ease into the night. Wish we would be able to spend more time with the room."
Had a wonderful stay ..… breakfast was good .. new hotel so everything is fresh and clean .. the rooms are big/bed so comfy /thank you to the Receptionists who was warm and friendly except the hotel is located back to back to a school so mornings can be noisy . If this is Tolerable than there is no issue …
"The staff were amazing, the rooms beautiful and spacious. Great location, but the damp in the ground floor rooms and lack of sound insulation made for a rather unpleasant stay. I could hear everything from the next room till 1am and everything in the morning from the school next door. Some insulation would go a long way :)"
Beautiful and clean hotel but very loud. The hotel is next to a elementary school with screaming kids and a man on a loud speaker. The breakfast was small and cold. There is no restaurant so you have to leave the compound for food and there isn’t anything good nearby.
"So far was a good stay, location a bit far. Staff is nice and helpful. The main issue on a villa is that there are no sound isolation between two villa rooms. It's shared roof and like a shared bathroom. So no privacy and if your neighbor would watch TV it's like it's in your room, not saying about toilet, it's just separated with a little wall, so weird."
"We booked the Villa with private pool but it was with so much of insects (Lots of mosquitoes, Huge ants, Hornet). And the shower area is an outdoor one. Not sure how I’m supposed to shower. We downgraded to a nice room with on-room shower facilities. However there’s no hot water due to many other users showering too. We waited till 3am to shower. No extra towels were given. Pool’s with lots of leaves etc. I guess it’s just not for us. But overall, the room and staffs are pretty nice."
"It's a small property. Have good rooms and very good location near to Ubud Market and Monkey Forest. Area of improvement - service (need to request every single thing), buffet breakfast (very limited)."
Our pool access room was very nice and spacious. There are 2 issues however. There is no restaurant and no food in the area other than a restaurant at another villa accommodation called Samaya (which was very nice). The location is too far from Ubud centre and difficult to get transport.
Linen was dirty when checked in but prompt action from hotel staff upgraded our executive to pool villa because no other executive room was available. Breakfast had limited options and had to chose one option which is quite small in quantity.
"Everything is beautiful, neat, clean"
up your facility
