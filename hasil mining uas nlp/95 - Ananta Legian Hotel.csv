"I found the Ananta legian Hotel a great place to stay.  The rooms and facilities are clean, the staff are friendly and the manager was very helpful in my contacting relatives overseas in an emergency situation.
The pool was a great place to do my laps.  Finally the Hotel  is within 130 metres of the beach which is exceptional for the price."
"Stayed here a few times over the last 4 years. The rooms are nice and clean. Everything always works. Tv, Ac. WiFi, Etc. The pool is clean & quiet. There is secure basement parking should you have acquired your own vehicle. The area (Double 6) is the perfect balance between Busy Kuta & Trendy Seminyak. Somewhere between being ‘a bit pretentious’ and ‘a bit rough around the edges.’ Everything you need is within a short walk from the hotel. Double 6 Beach is about 300m walk and is the nicest part of the main Kuta to Seminyak Beach Strip.
My picks are;
Corner 66 (40m from hotel) good local place to eat with a mixed Indo/Western cuisine. 
RDV (300m from hotel) is a great local Bar. Small, Simple, Safe. Caters for all ages 8yrs - 108yrs. 
Shopping this area is a mixture of boutique stand-alone stores to bootleg getto makeshift variety stalls. 
Transport? Get the hotel to order you a Blue Bird Group Taxi. 
If you know Bali. They are the only REAL meter taxis on the island. 
Enjoy."
"Ananta Legian Hotel is located just a few meters from the beach. You can view the sunset at the hotel’s rooftop. The staff is amazing, friendly, and all helpful. They serve good breakfast too. Overall, it was a very nice experience. Really value for money! I am definitely recommeding this hotel."
"Great location, staff very friendly, close to shops, beach , restaurants."
"The bathroom need to be check frequently. I got the toilet that clog at the end of my day. Stay for 3 nights. What is good, i choose the pool view. So i can jump to the pool without being hesitated & nobody swim at that time. So it feels like private pool. I like so quiet. Overall all arr good, place so strategic because close to everywhere. Staff are nice."
"The staff is the best! 
The room is comfortable, clean, the pool is really big. The hotel is near everything and near to the beach!"
Very clean and staff so friendly. BF is good they have bacon.
"Lived the welcome and staff are fantastic, rooms are clean great location"
Good location close to double six beach good breakfast amazing staff very helpful I will stay again
Great location and the rooms are spacious and clean.
"Ananta is the perfect location in Seminyak, short walk to the beach and restaurant just outside your door. We had a great stay could not fault the hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The pool also has a swim up bar which you can not miss whilst relaxing by the pool."
Location was fantastic  service was fantastic could may be update sun beds
"To be honest, it’s kinda dilemma to review this hotel, if you asked me, this one was a big deal at first, the location is closed to the beach, the front view of hotel is really superb, the staff? AMAZING, the room? Superb too, their AC super good since it’s can Cooling the room faster, but big deal for me was the air. Their hot water need a bit time to be heated, and it’s also not quite warm or hot enough for me, I mean if you always on business trip you know what I mean. Also the big no for me is their water seems like pure sea water, it’s smelly, tasted weird and it’s makes my hair greasy eventho I’m already using the best keratin shampoo. Maybe next this hotel gonna be my 3rd option"
All perfect for me!!
It’s a quiet area of Legian. You will enjoy it if you are the type looking for a more quiet resort to stay. Good food and drinks are all within walking distance. Perfect location.
Excellent hotel . Staff are very friendly and helpful.
"Clean , Big beds ,  Great Location , 
Lovely pool,  Wasn’t crowded at this hotel ,  Could have the pool to yourself most days .  Great for a relaxing Few Nights"
"A decent and clean hotel.
Staff were courteous and prompt in checking in.
Just within walking distance to many minimarts and scooter rentals. Walking to beach is a mere 7-8 minutes walk."
"Amazing hotel, great value for money & friendly helpful staff. Unfortunately the pool bar wasn’t open though (COVID?)  and was main reason for booking hotel."
"It's a brilliant location that's the selling point  it was modern enough and clean enough. Bed was OK. Linen was great. Both beach and bath towels had seen better days and the shower water was lukewarm at best....morning or night the water was garbage .... my toddler would not get in it. It really makes me mark down the experience 25 degree water I expect from the $20 a night places!
Music around the pool guarantees you will be less than an hour before being driven insane by balinese / Beijing Opera style music.
Rooftop bar not open  staff were nice enough.
I don't know if I would stay again...I mean I just love the location but think just behind is about the same price...and I like a hot shower !"
"The staffs are really nice and friendly, if you are on low budget this hotel could be an option."
Great for the price
"Staff was nice but there are so many ants  in the room.
I didn’t know that first, when I woke up I found ants were swarming in my carrier 😧
Except it, not bad for sleeping.
Pool looks good, calm."
Clean and comfortable room on the smaller size ! Arrived in Feb and had the hotel to myself! Standard size pool ! Gym facility consists of two tread mills in a small room! Friendly staff ! Close to shops and restaurants and spas in Legian ! Great location! Beach one minute walk! Didn’t book breakfast with the room! Breakfast on the very basic side ! All in all a decent stay!
"Nice hotel, but needs renovation. 
Friendly polite team members. 
Did not like the location"
The location near double six beach but the room little bit small..
"I can't fault the Ananta Legain Hotel for the service they provided during our stay. I had informed the Hotel of my 3am arrival a few days before to ensure that the room would be ready for us to check in to which they had. The location is ideal should you wish to be away from all the bars and nightclubs in around Kuta which was great for me as I do like my sleep. Though if your looking for a hotel to be closer to venues your better staying elsewhere.
The breakfast as other reviews have said is very basic but the food on offer was fine. I can't comment much on the facilities other than the pool as that is all I used there during my stay. The staff were always very friendly and helpful whenever we needed advice or asked for anything. The pool bar staff always made sure my cocktails were very well filled with alcohol, possibly due to a few generous tips they received and you could tell they were very grateful for them from the reaction on their faces, that also went for the other staff."
Decent location with easy beach access.  Nice restaurant scene within easy walking distance.
"Boutique hotel, my room was pool view. The scale of the hotel is fit to the lot, stylish designed , maximised space"
By removing lattice to ground floor the increase in usable space near the pool area would double making it far easier to access/egress pool area
"great location 
so many restaurants and caffee nearby 
5 minutes walk to beach 
my room AC regret not working 
breakfast menu is limited"
I went Bali for learn surf. This hotel located near the beach. Very good staff.
Poorly designed with the pool being in shadow s most of the day and quite cold.Roof top has nothing up there and no access from the car park to the hotel foyer which means a inconvenient walk up the drive.Rooms are clean and fairly modern and the hotel represents value providing its priced accordingly.Location is good
"The Hotel need more care from the management especially on the outdoor space and faciade.
It seems that maintenance hasn't  been done  from long time.
The staff is very gently and helpfull 
Room are clean very good."
Excellent location and friendly staff. Exactly what expected for the low price. Concerns as 1st floor guest located directly below us had a break in as the facilities are quite dated an security is not
"Rooms were adequate and clean. Great location. Staff were super friendly and accommodating. 
I had stayed at this hotel in 2014 and it was great. Unfortunately our towels smelled of cigarettes every other time they changed them, the bathroom sink leaked profusely and wasn't repaired before we checked out, the hotel ran out of drinks at the bar and not restocked for days, the restaurant ceased buffet service - presumably due to the few guests saying at the hotel. The hotel needs a new coat of paint and repair of the broken odds and ends - I got the impression the owners are trying to pump the last profit they can out of the property. The Wifi was slow and only really just running enough to tick that box. There wasn't much of a gym on the premises (just 2 treadmills).
Luckily the property is fairly central and you could easily access other locations for food, drink and other leisure activities. The hotel was adequate as a base of operations and a place to sleep."
"Hotel was ok, fast check in . the pool bar they close, cos no costumer."
Ananta legian is not bad for the price. Breakfast included was good.
"Unfortunately the photos look glamorous But the hotel isn’t 
It’s in need of many repairs 
This hotel is obviously struggling, it’s not good when you run out and do not have more  bintang in your bar and can’t get any until the next day"
Cocktails were not very good
Still renovated..
"Overall an average hotel. Price is reasonable located in good spot. Unfortunately the property is a little run down. The bathroom is dated. Had some issues flushing the toilet which was unpleasant. Unlike other hotels, there was no buffet breakfast. It was just made to order. The place is certainly due for refurbishment. I will not stay here again if I can avoid it."
"The miscellaneous charges for small thing such as towel and bed sheet are huge ($60) which is more than the stay for one day. Disappointed with services. Room facilities are so basic not worth the money.
Thanks, hope this feedback help them for futures."
"Good location
Overall OK"
"The hotel is definitely not worth the money you pay. I stayed there for two nights, and on both the nights the air-conditioner stopped working at about 5 am. The technician would take so long to come and finally fix the airconditioner that I could not get proper sleep in the place at all. They did not get it fixed properly even after I complained the first night. Secondly, the hotel only looks pretty in the pictures, it is actually very dirty and not quite well maintained. The water pressure in the shower was really bad, and it was not hot enough. I didn't want to use the pool because it didn't look that clean either. 
The only good thing was that on the day of my check-out, they sent me my breakfast to my room (instead of having to go downstairs) and let me check out an hour later, because I did not get any sleep due to the faulty air-conditioner."
Would like someone from agoda to contact me asap
"Not worth with the money we spent, children above 2yo should pay some charges.  No extra bed option. Too expensive for such hotel with no facilities. The staff are friendly but the hotel rules doesn't make any sense for hotel in Bali.  I will not go back there, neither recommend to our friend."
"The breakfast was horrible, and the hotel cant be 4 stars…."
This was our 5th stay in 8 years. No maintenance has been done in that time. Breakfast bad. Cleanliness bad. Internet in and out. Used to be very good for a low priced hotel but other than location nothing going for it
"Even though I arrived at close to 1 a.m., the staff were friendly and efficient. The airport pickup was flawless and the welcome to the hotel, including the chilled mint-infused watermelon juice, was perfect. The room is modern, with nice big tiles and overlooking the stylish new pool. The bathroom isn’t enormous but it was clean and well appointed. One thing that struck me was that the lighting in the bedroom was provided only by bedside table lamps, making the room dark when the curtains were shut. Apart from that, the setup was OK. 
Location-wise, Ananta is very close to Seminyak and within walking distance (I like to walk) to Kuta. I must say that Double six beach was not what I expected: it was quite dirty and messy, but that of course has nothing to do with the Hotel. A word of advice: head to the south of Bali, mainly Jimbaran or Uluwatu to see the beautiful blue sea from the postcards people often associate to Bali. 
The complimentary breakfast buffet was great, with a good variety of western and Asian options, 4 different types of juice and a-la-carte eggs on the spot. I would compare it to much more expensive hotels as it was fresh and yummy.
Overall, I recommend Ananta for a budget hotel near Seminyak."
"You cannot go wrong with this hotel.I recently went to Bali for a week and decided to stay a month. I stayed in 5 different hotels (reviews to follow) and the Ananta was pleasantly above my expectations.
I honestly couldn't fault it. It was quite unique in it's layout.
Most rooms had pool views, there is a bar & relaxing area on the roof of the hotel,the breakfast area was soothing as it had a large fish pond next to it.
The food was nice and had variety. (I'm a bacon and eggs man so I was easy to please) :-)
The location was brilliant. Turn left and you can walk to the beach. Turn right and you end up on Legian Street. The area itself is an upmarket version of Kuta & Legian. 
Being within walking distance of the Double Six roof top bar & bistro was a bonus as well.
I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
"Right from the moment that we arrived, until the moment that we departed, the staff at the Ananta Legian were extremely helpful. The manners that they showed, and the service that they provided was outstanding. They always went out of their way to ensure that you were comfortable in your stay. The location was fantastic in that it was only a short stroll of approximately 200m to Legian Beach and plenty of restaurants. It was also a short taxi ride either to Seminyak or Kuta. Shopping wasn't a problem with heaps of market stores in and around the hotel. In all we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone"
"it is good chance to live inside Ananta legian hotel, as it is one of awarded designer hotel, we wanna to take photo inside the hotel. however the staff stop us. it is unfair to us as I have paid for my room as its good appearance but cannot take photo. I spent 2000 USD for my honeymoon photo taking!!! FXXK it.
there is many thieves outside the hotel, just a street distant. Please do not do the money exchange along the street"
"I really enjoyed staying at the Ananta Legian Hotel.  I thought it was in a great location where you were greeted by friendly & helpful staff.
I read reviews prior to my trip & was worried about the rooms being too small.  Having stayed at this hotel, this point is irrelevant.  I thought they were an adequate size.  Why do you need a big room, when you’re out all day exploring, taking in the culture, etc?  I can also confirm rooms were very clean (&  I’m picky about stuff like that!).  The food wasn’t bad at all.  I was always too hot to eat a ‘hot’ breakfast in the morning, not that this worried my partner. 
The only thing I would have loved is that if this hotel offered spa/massage.  That was the only disappointment. 
I would recommend staying at the Ananta Legian Hotel definitely."
"valuable small hotel that located in legian. walking distance to jalan legian, which has a lot of food (from street food until 'real' restaurants), bintang supermarket (which is cheap and sells many things), and boutiques for all ladies who wants to shop.

the room is not as small as we thought, still can fit 3 person in one bed.

the check in and check out process is quite fast. (we were given fresh watermelon juice as welcome drink when we checked in!! :))

overall, satisfied with our stay in Ananta Legian Hotel"
"I loved the location of Ananta.. Only 5 mins walk to the beach (good restaurants/cafes within 2 mins walk) but tucked away in a fairly quiet street. We couldn't hear traffic at all from our room. We booked Deluxe Pool Access rooms, which I thought would all open directly onto the pool. Only one of our three rooms actually faced directly onto the room, but the others didn't mind - it made their room even quieter by not facing directly onto the pool. Our group walked everywhere from the hotel - into Kuta, around Legian, right into Seminyak - all easily if you like walking. When it was too hot we would get a taxi and didn't pay more than $AUD2.00 to get anywhere. Will stay here again."
"rooms were very clean. there is a strong sulfur smell each time the shower is on, but it was gone in about a minute. size of room is reasonable.

not a wide spread at breakfast, but the food was delicious and sure filled our tummies. 

the best part about the hotel is the location. it takes only a few minutes to walk to the beach. staff is also very helpful.

the only down side of the hotel is the swimming pool, which is very small. however, we were not planning to spend much time in or by the pool, so it was fine with us. the beach is a much much better place to sit back and relax!

overall, for its price, ananta legian was a fabulous stay."
"The design of the hotel was quite abstract which stands out. The hotel swimming pool was strategically placed for those who wishes to suntan  and yet have a swim. There is a swim up pool bar with staff that never fails to entertain there.
Seldom see much Asians there, but the rest of the occupants from Europe and Australia were very friendly.
I love the breakfast variety and they never fail to surprise me every morning.
The room was quite small but it was sufficient for a cabin sized luggage. I would feel that the space may not be sufficient for a 28"" luggage.
The food areas around the hotel was not bad. Loved the Indonesian food at 66 Corner.
As it is located in Legian Beach, the walk from the hotel to the main shopping areas in Kuta will take 1.5 hours - 1 hr 45 mins to get there. By Taxi took approximately 20 mins.
Another thing that totally impressed me were the staff. They never fail to greet you whenever they see you, coming you feel so welcomed!
Love Ananta Legian Hotel & will definitely want to stay here again!"
Ananta legian hotel is a very nice hotel in a great area of Seminyak. Within walking distance to shopping and the beach/restaurants. The pool and restaurant at this hotel are both of high quality. It is a great spot to spend some time. Recommended for people of all ages
"The first entrance into Ananta Legian Hotel and I was impressed by the architecture; you immediately see the pool surrounded by the various rooms the hotel has to offer. Our stay was made more pleasing with the friendly staff, especially frontman Dede.
The only challenge was having to take my shower with the showerhead spraying very hot water and switching to very cold water in seconds."
"The Ananta Legian Hotel is a most beautiful new building.  It was clean with comfortable beds, hot water and close to all amenities (beach, shops, money changers,etc.).  The decor of the hotel was very modern and the staff were friendly and helpful.

If I had anything to fault, it would be that the rooftop bar was advertised as being open until 11pm, but on returning to the hotel at 8.30-9.00pm, it was already closed."
"Ananta Legian is a great hotel in a very good part of Seminyak. 

Breakfast had a good selection and the poolside was pleasant with some great cocktails on offer.

We were looking forward to the rooftop bar as this was recommended to us by many people for its spectacular views...unfortunately it is closed for renovations at the moment."
"I would like to pass on some really positive feedback with regard to my dealings with the staff members at the Ananta Legian. We really appreciated the excellent customer service provided during our stay, especially Robbie, Yhudi, Evan and Rudy had provided during our stay and has far exceeded my expectations. They were extremely helpful, flexible and professional in assisting me with my holiday needs. Their service and very friendly pleasant manner has made my holiday so smooth and stress free for which I am very grateful. Ananta's staff service has impressed me and is worthy of recognition for this level of service"
"Ananta Legian is fairly new hotel but they have succeed in maintaining the quality of their services. The hotel provided with complimentary breakfast service which is amazing. On top of that the staff were very co-operative and let us felt at home. During the day the pool service along with the room service kept the smile on our faces. I over booked my accommodation at the hotel and was hoping for a refund, apparantly their policy prohibited from a days refund to me. Nevertheless, out over all experince with the holet was pleasant and nice."
This was already our 4th stay in Ananta Legian Hotel and again it was the correct decision. We very much enjoy the location - just a few minuted to the beach and some nice restaurants in walking distance. The staff is always nice and professional. The rooms are comfortable and clean and the breakfast is yummy. Really nothing I can find that I could complain about. Highly recommended.
"I stayed at the Ananta Hotel Legian for 7 nights and had a lovely experience. The staff were very welcoming and quick with check in. Upon arrival we were met with a welcome drink and were promptly escorted to our room.

Room was nice and clean, comfortable beds, plenty of amenities provided in the bathroom.

There was a great selection for breakfast, my favourite were the fresh made omelettes that you can order.

The pool is very nice and plenty of sun beds. Only thing that was a pain was, as the pool is in the middle of the hotel, it does not have sun all day (this was annoying for me as i like to sunbake). Staff at pool bar and roof top bar are very friendly and great for a chat.

Overall this hotel is well laid, clean, good facilities, friendly and attentive staff and would stay there again."
"we've stayed in ananta for new year's eve and though this is really not a hotel for family with young kids ((baby, too) we had a great time! in the centre of seminyak, close to the beach and main streets (shopping and entertainment) it's biggest value are owners and staff. always there to help with a smile, to provide anything that you need... organize transport, trips... we felt welcomed every single minute. baby is a special story - they all wanted to help us, entertain her... and entertain adults, too -  organizing new year's parta for all the guests and it was all for free!
we have no complains, but, just to make it more informative, hotel has small rooms, swimming pool and area around it is intimate and, well, small... food is ok, room service great...
all in all - great hotel for young people who are looking for fun day and night, but everybody are welcomed and everybody will find it nice thanks to the people working there!"
"We stay 4d3n @ ananta legian hotel with family. 5mnts to double six beach and we do spent 1 whole day just swim and rest at the pool (this hotel have pool bar), very nice for
adult and also for the kids.
Looking forward to stay again in this hotel.
Great bar, exterior and view from the top.
Very close to legian and shopping center."
"Had one wonderful vacation bali with Ananta Legian Hotel. It's relatively new hotel so, everything is very clean and hotel staff are well trained to take care of guests.  Location is superb; very close to shopping area and beach."
"the object poace nearby interests object in seminyak like cocoon bar, la panca, the djoglo, etc..which in walking distance from hotel...near hotel theres a nice italian restaurant and gelato  that makes no worry when sometimes you hungry...the staff kind and helpfull, the facility is good enough..quiet situations with pool in the middle of thia hotel..nice breakfast and I am still can't move on from the omelette..the best one I think..you can go to rooftop bar for seeing the senser from the top in this hotel..overall thx so much ananta and I am waiting to back for staying at ananta again..."
great location and friendly staff.
"Middle of Seminyak 3km from kuta mall .7 km from Bali brunch club, close to supermarket great spot if you prefer to walk. Rooms small but got what you need. Water doesn't get very hot in shower."
"The room is basic, but has everything you need. Aircon works really good! The only minus were the pillows - unfortunately too hard."
"Stayed for 9 days and had a great experience. I highly recommend if you're looking for a quite neighbourhood but nearby the beach, cafes and restaurants."
near to the beach
"I hardly not recommend this hotel reasones
-i asked staff for something they told come to reception and take it
-breakfast not good 
-room quality not good
-pool small then other hotel
- price so high you can choose different hotel don’t waste money"
Good hotel with good staffs
Loc is great! But the building is old. Not really worth the price we paid for.
"Enjoyed our stay here. The place needs abit more attention in regards to maintenance. Besides that, it’s value for money."
Read title. Everything else was pretty great though. Staff are very nice and helpful
"the hotel and room was very nice view, and clean and comfortable, the breakfast you can also take out , staff was accomodating, everyday cleaning and changing bedsheet . excellent"
Strategis dan dekat dengan restoran serta pantai double six. Good staff and very clean
"The staffs are very friendly. We stayed in another room type one night before, but we will not be there until night time to check in, so we keep our luggage in lobby and they helped us to check in when the rooms were ready and even move our luggage to the room."
"Not the same as the pictures from 2012 - no pool access rooms only pool view with lounge chairs, stained towels, dirty balance sheets, changed rooms due to shower and air con and 2nd room bar fridge didn’t work - was told beer where to chill not ice cold 😳 - was given a bucket of ice.  Breakfast was rice or eggs not both on paper and room temp juice and coffee. Pool bar never open, pool shut at 8pm due to no life guard on but never seen staff around. Needs a very big upgrade - paint and gloves changed 4 lights. Wouldn’t recommend at all!!!! Wasn’t happy and very disappointed."
"it was 5 minutes away from seminyak beach, very convenient, n loves the staff are nice"
At best a 3 star property
"Best party about this hotel was the aircon in the rooms.
Pool was overloaded with chlorine. No bar tender in the bar the whole trip. Construction noise whole stay. Rooftop bar is nonexistent. Hotel features are either broken or in need of a major facelift. Restaurant at the hotel was overpriced and underwhelming, didn’t event want to finish the food as it was bland and flavourless.
Safes in room kept showing error on them and had to get someone to open it for us.
Pictures are deceiving. This place is nothing like the photos or the adds. DO NOT STAY HERE"
"My girlfriend got skin allergic after stay in the hotel, only salt water was provided in the water pipe, no clean water for u to shower, reception staff is not polite, only the security guard is helpful"
Nice place to relax
So scary and quite. Maybe because of low season. But I rather not coming back for another stay.
Cool decoration of Art and cool Staff
Really a fantastic location. Not far from the airport and around lots of great restaurants and bars. Close to the beach. Rooms are nice and pool as well. Great value.
Good location and rooms are very well priced for the quality. Everything was clean and quiet. The design was so cool and unique.
"Too expensive for what we received, level 1 pool level room = Pool view room. No view of pool. Tv didn't work at all. I had to make running repairs on the toilet cistern to keep it working. Toiletries absolutely basic quality. Room very ordinary. No decoration. Room leaked in one corner during a brief heavy downpour and wet cushions. Concrete pad/terrace outside room mouldy, dirty, needs the Gerni, hand basin in bathroom had leaky tap and plug didn't seal, so that I couldn't wash clothes nor shave easily. The sliding door system out to the terrace was very dodgy and not secure; difficult to close it. Pictures on Agoda look good. Reality is a run down, shabby hotel, to be honest. Staff all lovely."
"Venue was very loud. People were in the street directly outside the hotel doing Karaoke till midnight. Very frustrating to hear from 6th floor and no solutions to move or anything. 
Hotel itself was very average. 
No rooftop bar as advertised and the pool was not in good conditions. If i know the amenities were going to be this poor I would have stayed different location."
Always being improved. Staff are wonderfully helpful. The new addition of the gym is great and the refurbished water feature/pond area has improved the look of the hotel. I look forward to seeing whats been improved on my next visit.
"The location is fantastic and the staff lovely BUT, the hotel is SO incredibly dated and run down considering it’s really not that old at all. 
I felt sorry for the staff because there was hardly anyone staying at the hotel. 
It definitely needs a re-fresh/renovation. 
It could be so much more than what it is. 
Definitely not value for money and there’s no gym just two treadmills in an old small room that didn’t even work properly."
"The reason I choose this hotel because of Shown  oN Agoda web is 4start hotel , in reality not even 3stars hotel , for agoda team- pls check the hotel before put qualification category
Hotel staf is ok Very kind and helpful 
Hotel Food (breakfast) is terible
Hotel amenities is poor 
Hotel price as a 4 stars hotel is so bad You get 2.5stars hotel"
"Location is very good, close to beach, shops and restaurants. Pool is lovely, staff is very helpful. 
There was some mold in the bathroom and no hot water but it was okay for one night."
"Outdated, rundown and unclean.  Hotel very tired and due for an update.  Basic accommodation which was appropriate to $54 AUD a night though when we booked it stated $226 AUD a night, on sale.  If we had paid full price we would have been disappointed.  Shower not working properly and towels need to be replaced.  Staff friendly."
"It is good value for money just somewhere to stay overnight. Being in Legian is far from all the action, and Seminyak is not close, ended up changing hotel to different one in Seminyak. Pool is small. Breakfast is very average. Staff is very nice and helpful. Hotel design is cool as well. Overall would not stay as location was not what I was looking for."
"a. Breakfast - the food choices were alright. The usual hotel breakfast, bacon, bread, pancakes, etc... We paid breakfast for the whole stay; but we were only able to eat once. We requested if we can have it packed so we can bring on our way to our tours (nusa penida and ululwatu). The staff said yes. But when we ask for it in the morning, they were not aware and they just stare at us.. We think it's because staff is different from morning or night. No proper hand over.
b. Facilities - pool is under construction.. Not much to do  in the hotel. Spa closes 7pm, which is another con
c. Location - it's near the beach and have lots of food choices
d. Room - they offer to clean the room every day, which is good. The room and bathroom were spacious."
"Would definitely recommend it! Pool is clean, room looks clean, and good location"
"Great place to stay, the one disappointing thing was the shower head. Had a lovely stay hotel close to the beach and great restaurants nearby. Very quite and peaceful stay nice pool with lovely staff."
"Expensive drinks, pool with cold water and no sun for most of the day, mould in several places in bathroom, smelly water, stained linen, pool towels are in terrible condition as are the deck chairs, extremely slow service and staff appeared not to know what they were doing in reception and pool bar but they were friendly. Excellent location though."
"Stained sheets, shabby towels, overpriced drinks by the pool and poor service."
"It was good overall.
Our room was huge and have two bathroom which we like it so much.
But breakfast was quiet disappointing compared the price. Very limited option and tasty is just so so. Staff was quiet friendly and hotel room was clean."
"Good hotel with low price. The room is small and clean, not bad. Breakfast is not many kind of foods."
I was made to move rooms so had to repack and unpack again after I had already done it once with no offer of compensation. Telephone wasn't working in the room so couldn't call for room service and the staff don't speak much English.
The linen was a bit grey and I think it's time to update them.  But overall good value for money.
"It could be a nice hotel but it needs to be refurbished.
Better stay at Grandma's place in SEMINYAK.  It isn't worth staying here. There's a construction goin on next to the pool too."
Great location and great price. When we needed something the staff were there within minutes. Great hotel.
"It was a great location, close to Seminyak markets and cafes. Overall I would rate this place 3/5 stars for service, location and value for money in relation to Bali standards."
"Ananta is okay, it is pretty run down and old but suitable if you will be out most the day. Unfortunately there was works around the pool so couldn’t lay by the pool or relax in the room peacefully during the day. But overall the stay was pretty good"
"I recommend here to other ,good location, nice staff and value"
This was my 3rd or 4th stay and this hotel is value for money. Very efficient check in/out. Breakfast is real value. Staff are always friendly and helpful. The roof top area is an undervalued space it would be great to see some sort of nightly activities offered. The view is great from the rooftop
"the pics of the hotel are not quite what you get when you arrive, rooftop area is run down, the staff were not very helpful and even tried to charge me double price for a beer i was drinking outside of my room because i didn't buy it from them..
there are far better hotels offering a far better rate than this"
"A nice place to stay.  Tasty breakfasts, nice pool and fantastic location.
Some maintenance work is ongoing during the day, however the price and location, compensates for this inconvenience.
I found the staff polite, friendly and extremely helpful. They are a great asset of this establishment and would be a reason to stay there again."
"When we checked in we were told that the pool area and the fish pond were undergoing maintenance, we had not been informed at the time of booking or in advance of our stay. We paid extra  $$ to have the beautifully photographed deluxe  pool access room advertised only to be looking at white sheets   & only half of the  pool area  in use, which meant there was a shortage of lounge chairs.   The breakfast area is on the ground floor  & centred around the very smelly drained fishpond.   Ananta Legian hotel should've advised us of the renovations prior or offered a substantial refund on checkin giving us the option to book other accommodation with our hard earned $990.   We loved our trip to Bali the position of the hotel is great but it is not worth $120p/n this is not a 4 star hotel.....   we feel ripped off

"The hotel is located in a very nice area. Very close to the beach and nice restaurants. A couple of improvements I could suggest are:
1. The shower water was stinking. Not sure why. I guess the water source tank was not clean. 
2. The Gym room can be enhanced and the operational hours should be longer. Like till late in the night.
3. The wi-fi quality was not good.  
Overall good value for money."
