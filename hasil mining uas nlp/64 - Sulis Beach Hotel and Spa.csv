"We stayed in Sulis for tonight, all their staff is nice and helpful. At first, I have a different booking ID, but they managed to put me in the same room so that I don't have to check out and check in again. 
We do not opt for breakfast as we are doing early-day trips. The swimming pool was amazing, we went at night and had a private pool to ourselves. The room is huge and very clean.
What can be improved is the ticketing officer should offer customers that booked online on day trips. I emailed them to plan for trips but they said they did not do that and there will be many on the site.  But I found out that many tour guides/ drivers offer these services and they have a pamphlet that can be used by the hotels for promotion when there are inquiries like I asked them. For one of the programs, I ended up booking online than using them, as I like to plan things earlier. 
Overall, I recommend this hotel."
"Besides amazing sunset view on rooftop restaurant and walking distance to the beach, this hotel has a very friendly design for disable person especially those who is wheelchaired. It has a special lift catered for them into the amazing rooftop pool. 
Well done Sulis Beach. This is the only hotel so far in Bali with a very thoughtful design for disable people and I applauded to you on it, on top of very roomy and clean room.
You are the hidden gem of Kuta, Bali."
"We had 2 children. And we’re very happy to have a holiday staying in Sulis hotel. Everything is wonderful: Very clean, comfortable, wide pretty room with the balcony, nice view, nice swimming pool, nice restaurant, nice people here! ❤️❤️❤️"
the staff were very kind and friendly and helpful. The room was pretty clean. I enjoyed my stay there. the restaurant has a very beautiful view. The beach close to it is not clean but it is close (5 min walk) to a street which was pretty alive at night.
"This place was better than most five star hotels I have stayed at. The place and its staff are organised and professional. Our room was huge, with a balcony, excellent air con and very comfortable beds. Everything was either new or renovated inside. I can't fault the place and its only steps from the beach. I would definitely recommend"
"staying here for 3 days, and no complain! the room really clean and comfy, no club nearby so it’s really quiet place to stay and get a nice sleep. but not too far from the city center. definitely will come back again someday!"
"Stayed for 2 Nights
Standard AC room with Balcony and No breakfast.
A very well established commercial Hotel at perfect location and fair price.
Nothing was bad about this place. Great staff. Great rooms. Great location.
Recommend to stay here if you want to trip to South bali(Uluwatu) , East bali(tanah lot) and may be go and come back from canggu and Seminyak.
Very near to Bali International Airport so you might want to choose this location as a start point or end point as per your iternarry. But do keep this on your list.
I stayed here for my last day as I wanted to be near the airport.
Also, there are few Indian restaurants at walking distance from this property. 'New Delhi Indian Restaurant' is the nearest and economical. 'Ruchira Indian food' is 2KM away and a very good option.
NOTE: Vegetarian Indians must carry snacks and whatever they can for their meals. In whole Bali Vegetarian food is not like what Indians eat and Indian restaurants are quite expensive and limited"
"Love Sulis spacious comfortable clean rooms I stay here many times on way to Airport only a 10 minute drive Nice choice of breakfast I do not think restaurant has fully opened up yet for lunch or dinner Love the pool the view is magnificent and you can watch the planes come in Cost around 50, in taxi to Legian or airport Definitely recommend"
"My 4th stay at the Sulis and keep returning for 
 a relaxing stay with all essential amenities on hand at unbeatable value. The rooms and bathroom are bright with modern décor and  larger than most 3 star hotels with clean and comfortable king size beds, a large fridge, a balcony and most importantly everything works without a glitch. This hotel is also unique in its proximity to the Jerman Beach (2 mins walk), the Ngurah Rai Airport (10 mins by car), and walking distance to many shops and restaurant's (Lippo Mall is 8 mins walk). The best feature of this hotel has to be its staff who go to lengths to make your stay a memorable experience."

"The rooms were spacious and very clean ! 
Location was great, close to everything , lots of restaurants in walking distance , shopping mall near by . 
Balcony with great sound prove door , you won’t hear anything from the street . 
100% worth value for money ."
"Old hotel with very nice room especially on family room we booked. The bed and pillow are comfy and clean 😊 value for money for transit or last flight time, very near to airport."
"I love the room, its big n clean. 
The hotel is new, so everything is still clean. The bathroom also big n clean.
They have sofa also can use as a sofa bed in the room. But since I booked for 5 person, they direct charged me an extra bed when I booked via Agoda. Turn out the sofa in the room is for the extra bed.
Too bad the breakfast they serve not in buffet. You have to choose 1 person 1 package. So for us stayed 3 nights, with 5 person, it's too boring."
Best hotel in Bali for my needs. So clean and comfortable. Spacious with nice balcony. Lovely staff. Walk to the beach. Walk to Lipo Mall. Good eating places and spas 100metres away.
Excellent and cleanClose to the beach lots of shopping
"Right next to beach furthest south of strip before the airport - more local and quiet than Kuta and without the touts/hassle and rubbish the beaches further north can have. I used this hotel two times as layover stops for either one or a few nights as I flew in and out of Bali travelling around Indonesia. Big, comfy, clean rooms. Loved the pool on the rooftop. You can see the planes land and take off but not noisy. Use Grab or GoJek for taxi to airport which is only 5-10 minutes away. Everything you need in this area, plus totally walkable up to busier Kuta. Will definitely use again for layover trip to Bali. Would recommend!"
Highly recommended place to stay when you want to explore Kuta area and if you’re fond of walking then this is a good place to stay since It’s not near the center. Definitely will stay here again if I / we go back to Bali
"the hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, the breakfast is delicious, happy and satisfied staying here."
"You get big room with bed 200x200cm and also sofa bed. Clean. 
Near Pantai Jerman, onlu walk - small beach with black sand.  Some tourist do surfing. 
You can see beautifull sea on top of hotel. Great view"
Loved the clean fresh rooms at Sulis. Location is great right on the beach in front of Kuta reef. Nice roof top pool. Excellent value for money.
"It is very hard for me to find a hotel that can accommodate our family of 4 in Denpasar. We want to be in the same room together as a family. After a lot of searching we found sulis beach with family room. The room is clean, the pool also. And it's not too expensive. We were paying $129 for 3nights. And there's  a lot of food nearby. We will come back here next rime."
"We have stayed here several times and love this hotel. The staff are so friendly and accomodating, rooms are clean and the rooftop pool is sensational."
Value for money. We stayed here a night because we had an early flight. It was only a 10-15 min drive to the airport. The shower and rooms were very clean. 10/10 would recommend
"Everything about this almost new hotel good. My room was big and tastefully furnished. The bathroom, the TV, the balcony and the pool were all big. Cable TV and big fridge. 
To top it all off all the staff were attentive, efficient and helpful.
The location on Pentai Jerman is great. I would say it's the best hotel I stayed at in Bali."
We arrived 1am from the airport to just stayed the night. But the swimming pool and the staffs were very nice. Room condition was a bit old but clean.
Near the beach. Easy to check-in. Cosy and clean room. Everything was perfect !
"Large 40 Sq M room.  Good Breakfast, nice location, great staff. Stayed 10 days, rented scooter and ventured out.
Definitely look them up again....
Vince"
"the room is very clean and spacious, we book a family room for 2 nights. There are 1 king size bed, 2 single bed and a long sofa. Bathroom is big and clean. They provide 2 cloth hanger at the balcony to dry up wet clothes or towel. Walking distance to Jerman beach. We definitely will come back 👍🏻"
This is the 5th time we have stayed at the Sulis Beach Hotel & Spa big rooms great comfortable bed staff are fantastic love this place close to LippoMart beach and walk along the waterfront to Kuta & the airport is not a long drive away
"We stayed in family rooms. They were spacious with comfortable beds. Bathroom was nice and clean. Rooms have balcony with towel racks so you have place to dry all those swimsuits. The rooftop pool was simple but nice. Front desk staff was super, very helpful too.."
this hotel is so clean and the staff helpful .i have stayed here a few times and would again .
"The room's so spacious and the location is strategic, so easy to find. The breakfast are good and cleanliness + friendly staff are great plus."
This Hotel is very clean and location naer the airport. Will come back again 😍🥰😘
"This hotel is very value every pennies. The room and bed were large, the rooftop pool was amazing and they were only one leap to the beach. We love every minutes spent there!"
"I stayed here for one night, the room is clean,cozy,location is good near German beach in Kuta. I definetely will stay here again next time."
"We loved this place because it was quiet, well located, clean with huge beds, and great pool. Also exceptionally priced"
"We can fully recommend the Sulis Hotel & Spa.
The hotel is situated in a quiet side street off Jl Katrina Plaza, about 100 mtrs to the beach.
The hotel is clean & modern, our room  was spacious & spotless, the bed was soft and comfortable, a great selection
 of pillows.  The Spa facilities are modern and their spa menu is extensive. 
Only drawback is the restaurant is not open for evening meals, but, that is not a real issue as there are many restaurants within walking distance from hotel."
"This hotel has really improved in it's services. Cleanliness is very good. Staff are all smiles.
Good job Sulis"
"The room was So clean and bed was so comfy.  Shower got a lot of water.
The balcony was attached to the room and we could enjoy the view from the hotel.
Rooftop pool was deep and large, they got some parasols and beds around there, so we really liked to stay there.
Breakfast was so so but we could enjoy omlet or something egg things that staff make in front of me.
I left hotel 6am and they dropped off at airport as well.
Overall the hotel was so good. I wanna come back again."
Situated just few mins walk to the beach and central Kuta area. The view from the rooftop swimming pool is awesome
"Ideal for layover trip. Away from craziness of Kuta, yet within walking distance if you. A more local beach across the road but is clean and great for sunsets. Big, comfy, clean rooms. Loved the pool area. Would stay again for layover stops. Recommended."
"After a flight change we chose this hotel for an additional 2 nights accommodation. We were attracted to the price and for the reviews we read. Incredible value and spotlessly clean. Large rooms, great rooftop pool area and the breakfast included was nicely prepared from a small a la carte menu. Situated at the quieter Southern end of Kuta with very short walk to beach. Would definitely stay here again."
Really clean and nice place to stay. Close to beach and pool on the top floor.
"If go to Bali, the first hotel i choose, the best, room big, clean n cheap, recommended..."
"If we come back to Bali, we will stay in Sulis again because it's so affordable and yet the hotel rooms are clean, spacious, and the pool of the hotel is so big as well. We really enjoyed our stay here! We hope to come back here!!"
"Everything is always perfect, an immaculate hotel, friendly staff …..exceptional, we will always stay here when in Bali."
The hotel is located near to the airport with really close access to the beach. The room is clean and spacious with a very affordable cost !! Will definitely book with Sulis Beach again for my next visit.
"I got a really great experience staying at this hotel. The room was super nice and clean, the rooftop view was amazing."
I enjoyed my stay at sulis nice room excellent aircond ...lovely balcony and great views from rooftop pool. Nice staffs everywhere I highly recommend this place and only minutes walk to Kuta beach and very near to airport ...you can actually walk to the airport only 10 minute
"Very value for the money. The size of room is super big, clean, near to beach."
"We booked the family type room, it was so clean and so big . Each of us can sleep in each bed. Super happy with the bedroom. Looking forward to stay here again..thank you sulis hotel. 5/5.yey"
"The location is good, the hotel is near airport, and also near mini mart. The hotel is clean, big room, and also all the staff is friendly and very helpful. Really recommend to stay in here"
"The room is very spacious, clean and well maintained.. I love the ambience here!"
The hotel is located very near the beach which is not crowded so very ideal. The hotel itself has a very good ambience and is very peaceful. Very clean and very helpful staff. Would definitely recommend the hotel to all travelers. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"What you read in Agoda is what you will get from this hotel. The room is spacious, the rooftop view is incredible, the cleanliness is first to none and I would never believe that I would get such affordable price for a very comfortable room. Absolutely convenient stay. They really nail it!!!"
Very nice hotel and clean with nice staff and valuenfor money
"Rooms is quite big with balcony  so relaxing, all area is clean, big tv only for local channel ( we are ok with that because WiFi is working).
Walking to the beach only 2 minutes"
"Spacious, clean rooms
Full working refrigerator
AC is really cold too
Toilet is so clean also!
We like to come back next time we are in Bali! We hope you will have branch here in Semarang :)"
"There is a lot to like here for the price.  Big clean rooms with huge fluffy pillows. Decent sized balcony with table and chairs.  Cold A/C and super hot water which does not run out. Ample space to do your thing, including a desk and a couch.  Larger sized mini fridge (not the typical square one) along with a safe in the room.  
Some areas that need work are the wifi (ok for email but working and movies is slow and or disconnects a lot which was madening) Set Breakfast was ok but I would have preferred buffet style and the kitchen closing at 2pm was a bit silly for room service or eating on the roof. Beach is close by but not great for barefoot walking due to the coral.
All in all, staff were very friendly and the place was clean and definitely deserves it's 9ish rating on Agoda.  Within walking distance to Lippo and Discovery mall as well. Would stay here again for sure!  Thank you."
"We stayed only for one night in a family room, which was really clean. The welcome was warm and friendly. The food we took was not so good and we didn't have any breakfast, so we can't say anything about that. The beds were great and the whole family had a good night's sleep."
"All are superb. The staff, the cleanliness, the swimming pool, the distance from the beach and the distance from legian beach is within walking distance which make me wanna stay again at Sulis"
"Really enjoy staying in this hotel, everything is well maintained and look new"
"OK, so this hotel is extremely clean and the people there are very nice.  The breakfast is standard because of the virus, but was very good.  It's proximity to the airport and the low price made this a solid 10 score in my book."
. The only improvement would be the dining but everything else was good and so clise to the airport
"We are travelling with 2 kids, and stayed in Family Room. The room was spacious and clean. Will definitely come here again next time"
Stayed for 1 night and definitely will stay in the future. The reception staff worked very fast and served us  very nice. Near airport. Big and clean room. Big and clean pool on rooftop. Nice sea view from rooftop.
"The room was spacious. I like since its clean and comfy. Good location ,near to the mall. Cleaning service boy was very helpful, the opposite with  server  in the restaurant. The hotel didn't serve buffet for breakfast, we need to order 1 day before, and the food taste very very need to improve. Thank you."
"Sulis is a decent place to base your travels if you're only in Bali for a really short time. Don't expect a full resort experience as it's really just a hotel with nice views hy the airport. My partner and I like to walk a city and explore so the ~20-30 minute walk into the busier areas of Kuta didn't bother us much, but be aware that the location (good because it's near the airport and the highways) isn't  exactly downtown. 
The pool is nice and the sunset views from the rooftop are beautiful so, in my opinion, for the price you're paying (we were roughly in the 25USD range) you're getting a lot."
"Spacious room, nice sunset view, and super near the airport. Recommended."
Very clean n nice hotel at strategic.. pool is ok but not as big as i imagined from the photo..family room is spacious
it's one of the best hotel i stayed. the room is big and spacious.  a mall  and shops ate nearby.
"Kamar luas dan bersih, pool rooftop sgt enak. Kewren lah overall"
Very close to beach. Neat & clean. Market is nearby.
The room itself is sparkling. U know its really clean & shining. All staff is very kind & helpful. Everything in this hotel was amazing. U should try Sulis if u r coming to Bali. won't regret it
"I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve stayed here? It’s definitely my go to when in Bali, it’s out of The Kuta noise, close to the airport, super comfy beds and pillows and the staff are sensational! All rooms are super clean, modern and well worth the money."
"Very happy and comfortable stay in here. All staff very thoughfull, care, suite family room so clean. I advice to add parfume in room and sprei. Thank you"
I like the location of the hotel and it’s near to the airport and other Indian hotels. I like the swimming pool its on the  top.  I will definitely come again.
"Amazing Pool with tremendous rooftop view. the room is very spacious, i love the hand made creature made from towel greeted me everyday when i enter the room after a long day activity outside. the towel creature was so cute and changed everyday, that small gesture from the cleaning staff was very comforting and leaves a special memory for me. the a la carte breakfast was superb. this hotel is also beachfront, so playing at the beach is just only in a few steps away. Worth the money and very recommended. thank you staff for making my stay was so delightful..."
"Very pleasant stay even though just one night, limited breakfast choice, overall it's a good hotel"
"Got a great rate and had moderate expectations for the rice and was surprised by the quality of the hotel/room. It’s kept super clean, the rooms are a decent size, well appointed  and the staff are friendly and efficient.
The restaurant has limited hours for dining and room service and the food is just ok. 
The large roof deck and pool looks straight over Kuta reef and is a perfect spot for a surf check, coffee or a Bintang.  The pool is pretty basic and has limited lounging area. Don’t expect much service up there and most times we just brought our own drinks and snacks.
If you’re not planning on lounging by the pool all day, I’d highly recommend this p"
Everything was good about this place. you can book it without any second thought.
I will strongly recommend this hotel.
"Lovely hotel, extremely good value for money, lovely and clean too! Staff more than happy to let us leave our bags after checkout :)"
A complete pleasure everytime I stay there. Fantastic value for money.
"It was really nice with staying here. Breakfast was great, and staffs were really friendly and kind. The bar up there could be more fancy at the evening if there served tasty cocktail or shisha."
Great value for money. Can’t fault the hotel
"Stayed 2 nights 
Pros: 
1. Very clean, not a single strand of hair or grime/dirt in the bathroom, room corners, restaurant and  lobby. I feel very like I can even sleep inside their toilet. 
2. Very silent. No noise at night. I swear this is the only hotel we stayed without the need to use ear plugs ( we are very noise-sensitive and light sleepers). The air-con runs efficiently and quietly! 
3. Helpful desk
4. Free transport to the airport. About 10 min drive when they send us at 5pm on a Sunday.
5. 1 min walk to the beach!
6. Pefect sunset/ beach view at rooftop swimming pool.
Cons:
1.  Need to walk a far distance (about 12-15min) to the halal eating place."
kamar besar bersih... value for money.. will be back...
"Great location, clean hotel, they have the big and very comfort pillows, very recommended hotel."
"NO early check in as I was there around 12.15 pm, bloody strict! Then I have to go around first and come back later.
Other than that, this hotel really recommended for staying and enjoy whether you are a solo, couple or family travellers.
They have a big pool on the roof top as you can also see the airplanes taking off or about to land, and the view for sunset also good!
It's not located in front of the beach but the beach is very near!
The receptionist was not that friendly but ok!
Other staffs such as housekeeper were very friendly!
Summary for myself, YES, definitely I will be back to this hotel !!! 
Keep it up! good Job 👍"
"Large clean rooms, great service. Right next to Jerman beach. Great staff."
"Clean, close to the beach, overall great spot."
If there is anything to be improviseret is the breakfast menu
We love the hotel place and also hospitality is very much liked
"The room is clean, spacious and feels modern. 
View from the rooftop pool is beautiful
Breakfast is... oh well, edible."
"The room is spacious and has a balcony, some of the items in the room are broken and not repaired like the mirror, the shower stand…
 There are some cute decorations and you feel welcome as soon as you enter the room. . rooms are cleaned every day. 
But security is quite lax and strangers can enter and exit the hotel by themselves and access all floors without a card. 
With affordable prices and service there's nothing to complain about."
"The room was large and done to a high standard. One of the best hotel rooms we have had in Bali. Good breakfast and friendly staff.
Great view from the rooftop pool but it gets a bit breezy.
We experienced some noise from neighbours and the street."
"Room is spacious and very close to German beach. Bed is big but too high rather than other hotel, but it's okay. Surely will be great value because the price quite cheap"
"Good location. 
Stayed for 2 nights. Clean comfortable room. Good variety of breakfast. Staffs were excellent. Next to the airport.
Would stay here again."
"The room is big,nice place near the bsach,the location was perfect,the staff nice,the swimming pool at the room top and big enough and also nice spot to look the sunset...this hotel just perfect"
"Staying with children at family room, felt like at home. Very large room, complete facility, delicious bŕeakfast.. my family happy during stay at sulis beach hotel. Even covid 19, they always do good protocol."
It's one of the best hotel you can get for the value that's close to the airport
Enjoy the German beach just across the road! It's quite so u can enjoy the beach by urself! The room is big and has a comfy pillow with balcony! Breakfast was good!
I recommended to all my relatives for staying here. Everything is perfect
"Very Clean Rooms, Staff Great, Prices very Reasonable, Beach very close, Will back here for sure"
Good room nice breakfast easy parking  would stay again
"Always love to stay at this beautiful hotel.
Highlight:
- Super fast and stable internet connection.
- Amazing rooftop and pool
- Helpful staff and fast response to guest needs.
This hotel just all package in one.
While my sister was busy with her online Thesis Defense, my parents could enjoying at the rooftop.
Also, beach literary just across this hotels.
Tempted to try their spa facilities too someday in the future.
Affordable price with excellent service that exceeding my expectation."
"Much more than expected.. Best location for a Tourist..  in less than a Kilo Meter you get  Beach,  shopping mall, commercial street with small, medium and mega shops... few hundred Car, Scooter hiring points, Food Street Food, Hotels, Restaurants, Eatery in super market, Drink, Bali Clothing, souvenirs, massage centers and much much more.... Breakfast was reasonably good.. with minimum staff.. Terrace Swimming Pool was a biggest attraction with a style of its own, it has a bar and  a small eatery also... overall I suggest all to stay here at least for a night...."
It’s the most softest bed I have slept on in Bali and that’s why I always come back! The best part of a holiday is about getting the best sleep ever and that’s here! Everything else is a bonus!
STAFF IS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY. shout out to Mbok Sri for helping out my needs!
Location is very close to airport and beach. The view from ooftop pool is amazing. Room and bathroom is spacious
This is a great hotel if you need a hotel close to airport. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Staff are fantastic and friendly .  The rooms road facing can be noisy . Great Spa. For a few nights its great. Rooftop bar not yet open but best view from up there. Breakfast good.
"Everything is ok except hotel don have iron. We need to find outside hotel to find service iron.  We check in around 6 pm so laundry hotel already closed to iron.

Great hotel. People  are helpful.
"Practical for staying with kids
