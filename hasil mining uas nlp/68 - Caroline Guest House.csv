"This is a good option if you’re on a budget. The bed and pillows are really comfortable, there’s a desk, the shower is good and gets hot quickly. The room isn’t big but it is big enough for a few bags. Location is great, right near La Brisa!"
Very good accommodation for the money - a bargain. Everything here is top notch in all categories. They don’t have their own restaurant but many choices within walking distance.  So quiet and close to the beach. Would stay again no problem. Great staff - everyone so friendly and helpful.
This place is absolutely lovely. So clean and comfortable. We’ve been travelling all over Bali and this was by far the most comfortable bed. The staff were so polite and helpful. Perfect location for the beach and so many restaurants!!
"Everything about my stay here was great. The staff are polite and helpful. The location is perfect, so easy to get to the beach and many restaurants. The bed was soo comfortable."
"Best value for money, clean room, not noisy on the third floor facing the ocean. Friendly staff and would gladly do it again."
Really nice hotel apartment! The building is a little run down but the rooms are very modern and comfortable! The balcony was facing a green pasture filled with cows which was so funny and super cute
"Stayed here for appx 15 days, loved every single day. AC is cold, room is cleaned everyday, fresh towels too. Staff are friendly, a lot of cafes around. Overall a nice place to stay. There’s also a laundry in the back of the place. Very convenient."
"Don't judge a book by its cover.
So so outside, awesome inside.
I stayed 8 nites 
Bedroom is modern minimalis style, comfy and clean. There is refrigerator and free flow water.
Staffs are nice. I got free upgrade room cos my previous room smells smoke.
Swimming pool is not large, but I like it cos indoor and clean.
I'll be back."
"I stayed here for a few days and for the price, I don't think you could get any better than this. Despite the cover pictures, I don't think they even have bunk beds. The room I stayed in (their cheapest one) had a king-sized bed, cold AC, working fridge and TV, working hot water shower, working electric kettle with free tea, and proper daily cleaning service. They had lots of parking space at the back. The front desk lady was very friendly and I paid directly there to extend my stay (cash and card accepted). I forgot what their wifi speed was, but I remember it was fast enough that I had no complaints in my room on the corner of the top floor (fifth I think). I never went to the rooftop but it should be nice. On my second day, I realized that they had a free water dispenser across the front desk so I didn't need to buy any drinking water. The only downside is that the place is quite far if you're coming from Kuta or elsewhere, but if you intend to spend time in Canggu then I wholeheartedly recommend this place. The area is not really in the city but not so rural either, I saw lots of nice restaurants on the same street. I would definitely stay here again for my future visits."
"Close to restaurants, bars and the facility is nice and clean. The staff were very helpful. HIghly recommend."
This guest house is located in the heart of Canggu. You can literally walk only 5-15 mins to the nearest beaches and cafes. Its awesome!
"Price for what you get can not be beat! The staff are all so friendly and helpful. Shower is HOT. AC is cold. There’s a tea kettle and mini fridge in the room which is very convenient. The location is right in the heart of Canggu and close to the beach. Great restaurants near by as well as convenience stores, shopping and bars. Wifi was also really good throughout the hotel."
"Excellent service and friendly staff. I stay for four days. I feel so much comfortable with my room.
I’d love to come back soon . Strategic area for neighborhood. Hope always successful with your bussiness"
"We booked this place super last minute as it was very reasonably priced and had great reviews, which I can see why. The location was great, 5 minute walk to the beach and it was clean and had everything we needed. Would recommend to anyone looking for something cheap and basic."
"The hotel near the echo beach, the room have so much space. I love it, the bathroom is so clean. and everyday the house keeping tidy up the rooms. and the staff is so polite. i have so much fun in this hotel."
"Love the place, the location are so perfect. I love strolling on the beaches. They're so close only +-5mins walking. Love it! ❤ will definitely stay here again on my next Bali trip."
"Everything was AMAZING.  Good deal, good location, good stuff, good room, everything is awesome !! Specially ,price to extend the room is cheap ! , Only Rp 10k / hour to extend on the room. Very recommended ! Its near to almost famous place on Canggu ❤️. This is my 4th time stay here hahahah , and will be back soon"
"This is my second stay, and this hotel is my priority for staying in Bali.
Location perfect, near to the beach, with the complete facility, and also clean.
The pool is great and there is open space to sit and enjoy the day beside the pool.
The staff was so helpful, and they provide free refill water.
Great place with cheap price."
"i stayed in bali for almost 2 weeks, and trying to find the clean, cheap and strategic area, and this caroline really pull me because all i want is in this hotel. keep your good service!"
"Great place to meet people, close to all you need and want!"
"I stayed here for 4 nights and not pricey, staff so friendly and the location is strategies near Echo beach. I love it. Very clean also."
The place just decentm but with their price its best. I had good sleep and the room is clean. The location only 5mins walk from the beach
"Nice room, quiet and perfect value for money. Happily again"
"Thank you Caroline Guest House for the last 4 nights it was such an unforgettable experience to spend my holiday with my bf. The facilities are great, the staff are super friendly as well, strategic location, and everything is just awesome!"
"From perfect location,
Good facilities, excellent cleaning,
Good breakfast.
For sure will be back."
Awesome experience staying here. Helpful staff clean room nice facilities. They have laundry right in back of the hotel.
For this price everything is perfect. Very clean. Staff are so kind and helpful.
"Lovely room with all amenities that you
Need,
Fantastic location,
Excellent and very helpful staff,
Will never hesitate to return 
Whenever back in Canggu."
"Strategic, staff very friendly 💯"
"Just walking abt 5mnts to the beach. Near from minimart, pharmacies, local food. The staff is very friendly, they clean our room everyday. I'll come back if i stay in canggu!"
"This guesthouse is comfortable and clean. The room was big ( for 2 people --> but i use it alone) . Located in Canggu , its about 5-10 min walking to nearest restaurant.  They have swimming pool inside the house. Unfortunately, my shower was broken, But over all is good"
"I stayed in caroline for 7 days
The staffs were very nice and kind, 
Very recommend for travelers who seek cheap place to sleep.
Internet are great too."
"We stayed here for 2 nights with our children, 5 and 11. Very quiet, clean environment close to the beach and restaurants. The indoor pool was wonderful in the heat of the day when it was too hot for the beach. Would definitely stay here again"
"Stayed here 4 nights. They clean the room everyday which is great ! 
Bed was very cozy. For people who travel low budget it’s a great place 🙏🏾"
"A great location. The exterior and downstairs area could benefit from some more life but the rooms are nice, comfortable and clean. The mattress and sheets are very comfortable."
"This place is located at an excellent point in Canggu, near everything."
"Stayed here for 1 night when I got back to Bali until I was able to move into another place. It's cheap, great location, relatively clean and staff were wonderful.  Bathroom is old/dated, very small, no hand soap provided so its definitely a travellers/budget place but for one night it was OK. Lots of backpackers so if you want to meet people can be a good place. 
If i was early 20s looking for a cost effective place to stay near the beach this would be probably what I'd look for."
"Alhamdulillahh..
The services was good..
The room was comfort..
The frontdesk was humble..
The location was near canggu beach..
The car parking need to be more develop.."
"Had an awesome time here, will definitely come back."
The place is great. All of the staffs not wearing any mask.
close to beachclub ajeb ajeb asek
"even though the room is tiny, we spent a lovely night there"
"I stayed for just the one night while waiting to check in the next day at my other hotel. Check in procedure was easy, room was clean. A little on the cramped size with two beds in there but if you're on a budget and just need somewhere to sleep then you won't mind at all.
Don't know if they have breakfast included, I didn't have it but there was a pool right outside my door which was cool, didn't use it but it was there if I wanted to.
Was just getting ready for a shower and realized there were no towels in the room. Went to reception and someone brought then 10 minutes later.
Not far away from the beach if you have a bike but still 10 minute walk, in the sun it's a tad hot so make sure to sunscreen up and wear a hat.
Enjoy your stay 4.5/5 stars I think is good"
Very good location and comfort hotel
Even getting better and the rest is the best☺
"Tempatnya nyaman bersih, staff ramah responsible"
best place for escape ur daily routine...
"Great place, cozy room, everything is wonderful."
Good place with Good price
all good in here but if you want to extend you must register again n wait till 14.00
"This place so good, comfy, and cheap."
Everything was perfect!
"Generous special pandemic price, but you can get big room, very close to the Ecjo beach, La Brissa, restos n cafes.
Point to improve: aisles and public space can be cleaner"
Been visiting for 3 times and will always come
Really enjoy this place!
"Good price, clean nice staff 24 hours check in we went there for business trip because I can just saw up, but on weekend make sure you book a room in advance."
my top staycation list...outstanding
"Rooms are quite large, the bed is comfortable. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Walking distance from Echo Beach. Very nice local restaurant next door, and several others, including a Mini Mart, an amazing Soft Cookie place, and plenty of others. Thank you!"
great in everything
My place of choice if I am coming to Canggu for 1 or 2 nights
"shower rusak, air yg keluar gak sempurna"
Best service
The way I expected!!
"Cheap, clean, near the beach, nice pool, friendly staff. What else could you ask for?"
Well located budget friendly hotel!
"good value for money but in my room 304, the wifi is off for 2 days so i need to move out. But overall great service, facilities, and everything you need!"
"I stayed in one of the cheaper rooms, was very small and wasn’t as nice as the pictures. But the location is great and the staff are very friendly and helpful."
"Clean, friendly staff, good location"
Small but lean and has facilities similar to hotel.
"Worth for the money. It has refridge. Near wonderful beach just bout 10 minutes walking. I booked 2 rooms. 1 room need AC to be repaired, coz its hot."
Very recommended one
"Nice place, very cozy, everything is. great especially the breakfast. 
Wonderful stay 😊"
"+ staff, location, swimming pool, and value for money
Need to be improved :
- cleanliness, at least the floor is expected not dirty
- there is no drinking water in the room, we should have own bottle to take it from dispenser in the lobby, may be the hotel can consider to provide glass bottle in the room so we can refill it
- the shower took times to be warm, but it is still ok"
The room was clean and comfortable. The staff were kind and the checkin process was easy. Highly recommend.
"All goods, cleaning everyday. Only 1 , there is many cat and their fragrance in stair and some building is annoying. Very cheap. With great location. I love canggu"
"Good place to stay, cleaned daily but no natural light in rooms and mosquitos came through gaps in the door frame. Free water and pool/social areas were great."
"I enjoyed my stay. An early check-in was possible, receptionist was friendly. Room was small but clean, even soap in the shower. They do offer free water which is great (bring your own bottle). I didn’t use the pool, but it looked okay. Unfortunately a bit noisy, you can hear everything from outside. Also I asked if I can stay one more night and the price was 30% more than what I paid on Agoda, so better not try to stay spontaneously for another night."
"There is a cat litterbox.
Location is good. Very central in Canggu and the price is cheap compared to other options"
"Got a really cheap deal, so it was worth for the price. Nothing superlative but really quite and super friendly staff. Reception 24h!"
"This hotel is the perfect place if you need a bed and a shower. 
I don’t have any complaints. 
It’s very basic, but comfortable"
"The kettle was rusty and old , didn't replaced.  They can change the bedsheet but didn't change the pillow case, after I noticed they change it for me. The Aircon was new but takes a while to turn cold. But generally the receptionist was pretty helpful and nice , maybe because I stayed for a week. The reason why I gave 4 star is because of the value for money and after feedback to them, they provided me with what I need... Even the floor mat was upom request, strangely. They rent me a bike but helmet was very bad condition! The evening crew were mostly young teenagers who couldn't speak much English. Hotel had a swimming pool but they turn off the circulation system somehow. The place is next to a cow barn so expect some smell if you are parking your bike and walking back to the room. You wouldn't get the nasty smell in the room though. They provided me with a reasonable size room. That's something very kind of them. Thank you for the hospitality ."
"You get what you pay for. It's pretty cheap for it's location as it's in the middle of everything in Canggu and only a 5-10 minute walk from the beach. The room was pretty spacious and clean, but the bathroom can do with an update. 
Staff helped us rent a scooter which was super easy. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay at Caroline Guest House."
"For a room with full facilities, it was quite affordable"
Good place to stay and near to beach.  You can walk hardly 600 metre
"The hotel itself did the job and for the price can’t complain. Great location and lovely friendly staff, the place was a bit grotty and the room was very small with the big bed."
"I paid for a room with ocean view. You can see the ocean far away. On that floor there is a man living that is feeding some cats and has a litter box in the common area, which means it stinks of cat shit.
Complained to staff about this. Stayed for 16 days in total…"
"Nice clean place, quiet but still close enough to everything."
"The best thing is location, 5 min walk from Echo beach. 
The price is cheap yes, but feels uncomfortable to stay overall, no outside window make the room too dark, the wet smell inside the room. The photos on the site  do not comply with the reality. 
However, I must say that the staff is really helpful and hospitable."
Ideal if you are on low budget
"Good place to stay in, good location, close to the beach.
Staff was friendly. They provide free mineral water as well. The bathroom was clean which is the most important thing for me. Pool was nice and big. Some parts of the furniture were a bit dusty, but nothing too major, should be easy to fix."
"Room is clean and worth the price paying. 
Staff are friendly too. 
The location is bad as it doesn't has much things nearby. If you have your own transport, that's still fine. 
Else, the location does not allowed grab/gojek pick up. The group of locals (not sure are they the taxi drivers or gangster) are hostile. 
One night i ordered a grab car and an angry man running towards the car shouting and want to pull me down from the car (luckily i did lock the door), the grab driver dare not to drive as well apparently there are group of them at the back. And the driver is scare and ask me to go down too. 
It's one of the most traumatizing experience in bali."
All windows view face to corridor and very small pool
Thanks caroline staff for your kindness smile and help us . The hotel was quite but all is nice then this place is near beach and view was beautiful
"We were thankful to find a place since our own guest house's AC was broken. But the room was small, the bed really stiff , and the AC was more like a fan."
"The bed sunk down, bathroom was small even for asian size, bed bugs, not so clean floor. But the location near echo beach, many food around, store only 2 mins walk, staff were nice."
"Loud, dirty, overpriced, bad Wi-Fi, bad service
I stayed here for 4 nights, it was about 50% more expensive then hotels I booked so far in Bali but I thought it will be worth it. 
The only good thing about this hotel is the location. 
My bad experience started the moment I entered the room, the bathroom was filthy and the tap didn’t work, I tried to shower but it barely gave out any water. I stayed for 4 nights and my room wasn’t cleaned once, everything in the room is in bad condition, there was mold on the curtains. They played music by the pool past 10pm on a weekday.
Wifi works but it’s weak, one day they changed the Wi-Fi password out of nowhere without communicating it at all so I got disconnected during a work call and only got a new password after I complained"
good value..comfortable room..need a better pillow.. clean enough..walking distance to echo beach
"Good location, comfortable bed, however felt very dirty with ants and spiders everywhere, bathroom walls looked dirty. The place was cheap however I probably wouldn’t stay there again."
"This hotel was cheap, in a great location and the staff were friendly, but the room was not clean enough to feel comfortable."
It was totally fine but the water was very small and I can not borrow any plates
"For room clean, can be improve more."
Good enough for the price
It was okay but it looks really different than on the pictures. Rooms have only a really small window so it's super dark and it was really expensive for what it was.
"average room, small natural light and average pool. But for the price it’s okay. close to the beach and staff are helpful"
would stay again
"No running water from the shower and sink, bathroom was not clean. Called to get someone fix the water but no one came. My friend asked for 1 extra towel but was declined."
"The bed is nice and the stuff was friendly & helpful. The location is great as well. But besides that it's a little disappoining. 
There was an used yellow tissue on the ground and hair on our bed. There's not really hot water and out of the shower comes way to less water. The pool for sure needs new electricity and there are some kind of animals living in the walls or above (3 Floor)."
Only stay there if u’re on budget and the staff is kot nice
Signs telling everyone to wear masks yet none of the staff adhere to it.
"So hard to drive to the hotel, very thin roof, and could not sleep because of the dog barking."
"Yes I would recommend it.
Very clean and comfortable.
Nice staff."
Not going bqck
"I booked 2 nights here, even i was checking out early. Good house keeping, basic needs and cool AC, and also they have local restaurant. Easy to order meals and eating something, and renting scooter too. The location is perfect in main road of canggu area"
"It's a good place to stay for a couple or three days, you have everything you need in the same street and it's a 10 minute walk to Canggu beach. Perhaps if you are looking for a longer stay it might be a bit sparse. The basic room, at least the one I stayed in was a bit noisy as it overlooks the street and the bathroom was very small. Otherwise everything was fine, the pool is great, there is a pool table and free water and coffee. The staff is also very friendly!"
"Can really recommend it! Welcoming and friendly staff! Water, tea and coffee available for free- great Location!"
"Really comfortable for solo traveler . They have laundry , and spacious room"
"Close to nice healthy restaurants, beach and massage place. Staffs are friendly n my room is always clean there"
"location is great, near the beach, the room is small, clean, the ambiance of the hotel is not really good, cheap."
"We enjoyed our stay in Caroline Guest House, location was good and the room was nice. Also we rented nice scooter from there."
"Nice room and has everything you need. Free fruit, water, coffee, tea. Friendly staff A+"
