Column 1
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay of 7 nights at Bintang Kuta Hotel. Staff were courteous and friendly, facilities and room were the standard you would expect at an international European hotel chain such as Accor, specifically a Novotel. The rooms and public areas were clean and well maintained. The hotel is guest friendly.  Room was made up every day, linen and towels changed with fresh ones, toiletries were replaced. Excellent housekeeping! The swimming pool was clean, and pool bar well stocked and staffed. Wifi is fast and strong signal, I advise you to use a VPN at all times though, because the network security is non existent (username and password are displayed at reception). Additionally, you are allowed to use the very large (and warm) pool at the resort next door, as also the rather impressive gym and sauna in said resort. Airconditioning, lighting and plumbing were to Novotel standards. There is no bathtub, for those that expect one (I don't like bathtubs anyway).  Breakfast was more suited to Asian tastes (suited me fine) though there are 3 varieties of eggs, chicken (only, as Indonesia is Muslim) sausages, pancakes, french toast, plain toast with condiments, cut fruits and fruit salad, 2-3 cooked western style dishes provided in the breakfast buffet which the average westerner should have no difficulty making a decent breakfast out of. The hotel is situated in a quiet end of Jl. Kartika, and has an ATM in the building as well as one opposite the road. Both are attached to banks and are safe to use. Avoid most of the money changers in shacks, use a money changer in a good building. There is a plethora of restaurants, take-aways, 2 major shopping malls, convenience stores, massage spas, money changers nearby in a 2 minute walk radius. Access to Kuta beach is via the resort and you can walk from the room to the beach in your swim wear without leaving the hotel premises, picking up a towel from the resort pool on the way. You can book day tours at hotel or direc"
"We have stayed at this hotel many times. Our recent visit was just as great as we expected. 
The staff are very welcoming and made our stay very enjoyable. 
The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. Nice big super king beds which are very comfortable. We booked a family room which can accommodate 2 adults and 2 children. 
The hotel is located between the 2 shopping centres in Kuta, and is a short walk to the beach. Lots of amenities close by which include a bank with ATM, food places to eat, a coffee shop across the road, markets, massage  parlour and convenience stores. Waterbomb Park is a short walk away,  and there are plenty of taxis to catch along the main road. 
The hotel has a swim up bar with happy hour 3-6pm daily. The breakfast is tasty and operates 7-10:30 daily. 
I would highly recommend Bintang Kuta Hotel."
"We try stay at the bintang every time we visit Bali. Such a good place to start and finish your holiday. 
Located in a quieter area but still close and convenient to things like the airport, restaurants, markets and the beach.
The hotel is in need of a bit of TLC with some rooms needing maintenance but overall, a safe place to book knowing we'll enjoy our stay."
"I was more than happy with my stay at Bintang Kuta. The staff were pleasant and more than ready to accommodate requests.  The room  was spacious and very clean, the bed comfortable, breakfast good and the pool facilities excellent.
I requested a late checkout which was offered at a very reasonable rate.
I will certainly be staying again on my next visit to Indonesia."
"Arrived unexpectedly, staff welcoming,friendly and very accommodating. Room spotlessly clean, nice and cool and well equipped with fridge, really comfortable bed and pillows, tv, water and space- 
Breakfast was abundant and catered for many nationalities- and delicious 
Lovely pool, plenty of sun beds 
Again staff couldn’t have been kinder or more accommodating- one of us was unwell and the care, concern and assistance was beautiful"
"Stayed many times at Bintang Kuta, great price, very nice clean rooms, helpful friendly staff, good breakfast choices, probably back next March for a family  birthday/holiday. Good location for restaurants and shopping."
"Southern, quieter end of Kuta, near airport, plenty of good bars and restaurants. Guests have access to gym and pool in the upmarket Bintang Resort next door, although its own pool is quite nice. Rooms are large and comfortable. Breakfast is average, but reasonable for price."
"A lovely hotel, super clean and the staff are very accommodating. We have been well looked after. We initially booked for 1 night but ended up stating 4 consecutive days. We have left Bali for 3 days to visit Malyasia and they have kindly looked after  a few suitcases for us. We will be staying another night once we return to Bali. Can't wait! The food is delicious too! 🙏"
"We stayed in the Family Room for 4 nights. The room was really spacious, bright and comfortable. The bathroom has 2 shower and 1 bidet, so we don't need to wait long to get a shower 😊 The location is really strategic and near to the beach. We would definitely come back to this hotel again."
"The staff were nice, place was great, breakfast choices were also okay, a few minutes walk to the beach where I enjoyed a very nice Bali sunset. It's also close to shops, Discovery mall was of walking distance, also close to the airport."
Amazing stay for a great price. Expectations were not high since it was a cheaper hotel but we were blown away by the cleanliness and spaciousness of the hotel. 10/10 would recommend
"Good hospitality with such a good price too. The room was quite big for king bed deluxe room, around 33m2 room, that was pretty good for me with my sister and her 2 younger kids. They give variant menu for bfast too, even in ala carte bc they just have 7 room were booked, which not that many visitors. I was so glad to pick this hotel anw, and would like to stay back."
Located within the heart of Kuta. Close to airport and nearby shopping malls such Lippo and Discovery just right next to hotel. Plenty of restaurants nearby hotel and just within walking distance.
"Low budget 4 star hotel. The room quietly big. And so clean. They do the dine in buffet breakfast already,  which is good. Highly recommended hotel"
Great deal you get a nice hotel room with good wife n international t.v. n aircon PLUS you get the use of the five star Resort beside it nbthe use of all its facilaties n beach access best deal in Kuta. Five Star Hotel
"I stayed here as my flight was in the early hours of the morning and it was perfect for that purpose. I was at the airport in less than 10 minutes. However, if you were looking for a longer stay and wanted to be in the centre of Kuta it is right in the middle of everything, yet tucked down a little alley so still very quiet. Pool is nice and rooms spotlessly clean."
"Excellent value;  Very nice facilities.  A good buffet breakfast with many options is included in the price.  Free airport transfers for those staying for 3 nights or more.   Excellent location; close to Lippo Mall and a 10 minute walk to Discovery Mall.  Have stayed here once or twice a year over past 5 years.  Unless you want all the added features of an expensive resort, this is the place to stay!"
"Very friendly staff, clean, good breakfast, what you need more?"
"This hotel is located near shopping mall where we can get dinner or lunch easily, just by a minute walk.  The room we stayed were clean and quite spacious. We requested room far from lobby and street coz some guest complained about the loudness of the motorcycle n car. However we still got annoyed by the housekeeping trolley whenever they walked along the alley.  During this hard time, covid recovery. Unexpectedly breakfast was great with lot of choices. Overall this hotel is great and worth for the money."
"Spacious room, clean, good ambience, near from beach and friendly staff"
"Room was clean, friendly staff, wallking distance to the beach and shopping areas."
"Lovely clean hotel- beautiful, helpful and friendly staff."
"If you want to relax, this is the one.
Small but lovely."
It was very good stay. Very nice hotel.
"The place is clean, the rooms are spacious, and the food is quite tasty.  I like this hotel"
"Rooms are spacious and clean, strong ac and great staff"
The room size is huge and also clean.  The location is good👍🏽👍🏽
"All service was good, start from FO so friendly and helpfull. HK staff very nice and polite too.
I will back to stay here, closed to everywhere."
"Having explored the entire island it was wonderful to be back at Bintang Kuta. Staff always amazing, friendly and welcoming. Room lovely and clean, functional with really comfortable bed and pillows. Breakfast: delicious.  Best value for money"
"The location is ok,but the rooms are big and comfy.The buffet breakfast is more than satisfactory.Overall best accommodation money can buy"
I will come back to this hotel. I like the buffet breakfast so much. It is also one building with ATM machine.
"Pros
1. excellent location on the main road (near mall, cafes/restaurants, and Waterbom. there's an ATM and convenience store nearby, also close to the airport)
2. clean and spacious room
3. helpful staff
4. have access to the beach (Pantai Jerman) and 20 mins walk to Kuta Beach
Cons
1. poor connection, slow wifi
2. away from the busy nightlife area, e.g. Canggu (but i'm fine with it).
3. complete toiletries, but body soap could be improved
i didn't try the breakfast so couldn't say much. overall, the price is worth the facilities!"
Best Hotel
Happy to be here and very satisfied with big room and the facilities of the room and also the area of the hotel
Clean and large room. Facilities awesome. Pool great. Staff really nice and helpful
Thank you  so much for free  upgrading our room and your  kind hospitality .. really apreciate it. Hope next time we can stay at Bintang Kuta when we go to Bali
"Close to beach & shopping, staff were excellent, very helpful, would definitely recommend this hotel"
"Great rooms, facilities and staff. Breakfast is terrible, but it’s nice they offer it. 
Excellent value for money. We enjoyed our stay."
Very good hotel will all facilities. Beach access from inside the property...
"Mudah akses, fasilitas lengkap"
Clean. Nice staff. Value for Money. Will stay again.
"good hotel
good breakfast
value for money"
clean rooms not run down
"Room is clean, location is great (near lippo mall and a lot of restaurants nearby - all within walking distance). Staff is friendly and helpful.
Very recommended."
I enjoy my stay here in all aspects. The room is spacey and staff are nice. The pool is good for chill not for laps. Internet can be up-and down though.
"Stay for one night/ transit, location is fantastic! Right at kuta heart, close to airport, money changer (central kuta money changer) right next door as well as restaurant, beach and shopping. 
That’s why we choose this hotel.
As for breakfast it was ok but I think if we have to stay longer food abit boring. 
Friendly staff as well as transport to and from airport is fantastic! 
👍 except room need abit airing I think bit stuffy but over all it was great stay."
"I've ever stayed in this hotel few years ago.
I'm kinda worried after few years of pandemic the condition of the hotel, but i'm happy for the decision that i made to stay in this hotel. The room hotel is clean.  The location is strategic. The staff's hotel are friendly. Keep up the good work. Thank you."
"Kebersihan, fasilitas, lokasi The BEST dg harga yg murah"
"Everything good, must be recommended 👍👍👍"
"Near to airport, very touristy place."
"Quite worth, clean and nice... near the beach.
But less with the traffic...
Overall awesome 👍👍👍⭐⭐⭐"
"Rooms and location very good , but breakfast not as good."
This hotel is absolutely amazing the staff so nothing but go over and beyond for you! My only regret is changing hotel for the last 5 days. Will stay again and again
"This hotel needs better photography and marketing, because its MUCH better than expected.   The rooms are modern and brand new.   The AWESOME huge ocean pool is not even shown on the pictures!!!     
Breakfast is good!
One thing- the Internet/WiFi is TERRIBLE.    
So terrible...it's not usable.    I would recommend them spend a couple of bucks and get usable WiFi.     Do you expect to have WiFi.    The staff seems unaware of the issue...  not sure how this is possible.  
If this hotel actually had WiFi, it would be a solid 4 star property.
I would stay here again, just have to accept the fact you will not have internet."
"I like this hotel, staff very friendly and polite. Hotel very clean, they changed my towel every day. My parent like food there. 
The only problem I had during my stay is safety box keep going error. Over all I'm satisfied and I'll back again.  
Thank you all."
Extremely good value for money. Very clean and tidy property. Great pool and access to bintang resort larger pool and sunset bar. Would gladly stay again.
"I like Bintang Kuta Hotel, staff very friendly and helpful, nice and clean, good location, good value money. I recommend this hotel and  I'll back again. Thank you guys and keep your good job."
Good place to stay. Good service. Strategic place
Great place to stay as always!
Good place to stay with access to bintang resort too.
friendly hotel staff and a great location. Very clean and spacious hotel rooms. Very happy with the extremely helpful staff for their assistance and guidance
Keep coming back year after year
Highly recommend to all travellers. Great value for money. Adequate buffet breakfast. My only minor criticism is that they have no gym facilities and their WiFi is slightly slow / cuts out from time to time. Great location and very friendly staff.
The hotel is definatley a value for money and also placed at the apt location.
"The hotel is very clean, the room big & the staff very friendly & can't do enough for you. The only downside is the rooms don't have balconies which was disappointing"
we have been there only for one night because we got a really good deal. The hotel was great with the poool and also the rooms were amazing. Would definetly stay there for a few more nights if we had time
Value for Money. Best Hotel at Central Kuta.
"Satisfied with my stay here, the room is clean and comfortable perfect for a long stay, staff are friendly and it’s near to the airport."
This was a lovely hotel. I only stayed for 1 night to visit friends staying next door. Rooms are modern and very neat indeed. Pool looked nice as well. I'd stay here again but it's not my preferred location. Hotel itself is excellent.
"a very good choice hotel for a short trip to Bali. located close to a shopping mall, souvenir shops etc...."
All is good
Recomended hotel ❤️
"Surprise hotel ,clean modern well located near the airport"
"Good location, Awesome Pool,Great Staff would recommend as great value for money we paid."
"Stayed for one night after vacationing in Sanur and Lembongan and it was a great choice close to the airport. Well located, clean and nice amenities."
"We had 2 weeks here.  Very nice hotel. Friendly staff. Breakfast was on par with how things have been with covid.
Not far from Lippo Mall.  Short walk to Discovery Shopping centre.
Drivers out front  very good."
"Staff not educate for late check in, we arrive at 03.30 am and wait to long for check in and room not as per our request."
"Spacious room, friendly staff, great deal, breakfast is so so."
"Very good facility for the price.  Comfortable, clean rooms. Good location.  Breakfast choices have improved.  Very polite and helpful staff.  Hot water in the shower was intermittent.  Currently under maintenance so hopefully that will be fixed."
"The hotel seem old, but clean and well maintained. 
The room is spacious but a little musty smell, The rate is affordable, especially when you book with Agoda you will get fantastic price"
"There is only 1 big towel per person, no hands or face ones. The breakfast is basic, nothing special but it can make you full. Staff couldn’t find my reservation in the system, so I had to leave 500k deposit when I checked in."
"Located near Anvaya and Discovery mall. Good value for money, just like other 4 stars hotel. One negative point is the slow wifi, the others just perfect."
"Like many others, I stayed here for a night before catching the flight. It was a surprise to see  a spacious and clean room. The shower was not best as the hot water was not hot enough, but it could be due to some issue on that day. Overall, good choice for transit or a tour base."
"Unfortunately, the wifi is very slow & difficult to connect"
"+strategic location.
+spacious room, comfy bed.
-the hot water in shower is just warm and not for a long time.
-breakfast has adequate choices, but the taste is just so-so.
-the slope to the underground parking lot is really steep!"
Entry to car park and exit very easy
"Nice clean rooms and renovated, on arrival staff could not find my booking after I showed all confirmation after 40 minutes they worked it out and then my room request for double bed could not be given only single beds. The reception desk needs to smile and help when you guys have the problems instead of the sour face and no help. 
Breakfast buffet was fine nothing like wow but all ok. 
Kuta area is still very quite and many things closed. 
Overall the place is clean and tidy and certainly good value to stay."
"kamar nya besar, bersih , dan kamar mandi nya besar. lokasi dekat dengan airport ngurah rai. Kekurangan nya di breakfast , rasanya biasa aja."
"clean, big room, small pool, standard bf"
Value for Money
Good location
"It is a lovely hotel if you want peace and quite,"
"Happy 4 nights stay with family.  Clean and good basic breakfast. Good food around including  Indian, Vietnam and Chinese. Very near to airport."
Just next to bali bingtan resort it’s actually a part of resort but cheaper option
"The food selection was poor, mainly for local guests only. Even the salad was so poor."
"Great location, good service and happy with all their facilities 
Sonja
Perth"
"It was poor, mainly for the local travellers only."
"The hotel is in a great location, the rooms are great size but have lost there sparkle. I have coming to Bintang since opening and feel the towels are a little worn and bedding not so white. Overall for the price its probably on par with others around, but with so many hotels to choose from may need to lift there game a little."
"This hotel is located in Kuta and is not that far from the airport and there is a shopping mall a couple of hundred metres away but the shopping mall is nothing much.
Location wise is a bit of a letdown and there's not that much in the area and it's away from the main part of kuta Beach and the busy night life area.
The rooms are quite big and spacious and they have beds that are reasonably comfortable.
There is a safe, tea and coffee making facilities, a LCD TV but it has a poor selection of TV channels.
There's a pleasant swimming pool which is a reasonable size with plenty of Sun lounges surrounding it and there is a pool bar but not a swim up bar.
The hotel is not bad for a few not stay but I think there are a lot better properties around."
"The room not small but not big. The hotel look old, and I disappointed about the bathroom, because the water comes out very small"
"stay for 2 nights this holiday, still value for money if it's just to stay the nights.   
better skip ordering breakfast coz breakfast is getting awful not even good at all... not much of menus and poor tastes too,  better find food outside the hotel or just do online orders.
the hotel had the same situations and feels like Kuta area which is really dead by now. seems people moved to other better area than Kuta.  better pick other places like Nusa Dua  or other area."
"Stayed for 3 weeks April 2022
Very few Guests (only 15% full) and the Wifi System struggled to keep up."
"Rooms could do with updating and more storage space. 
Ideal for getting about centrally located 
Ensure you confirm the shuttle bus before spent an hour trying to find the bus."
Wifi is Terrible!!
"Rooms doesn’t have balcony, has kind of stinky smell, window is present which is locked you need to take key from reception to open it. Breakfast has very less options and most importantly wifi doesn’t work"
"On arrival we were told the hotel was full despite having booked ...... I do not understand why our rooms were given to someone else. We were told we would be upgraded the 5 star Ramada next door ( we were excited to be upgraded ) until we saw the rooms - having stayed at the Bintang Kuta last year I was excited to show my family the hotel.  If the hotel was full, why was the hotel still advertising rooms available while we were in Bali. During our stay a light was shining all night in a cupboard when pushed it firmly closed to activate the off switch it would pop open again. When I reached up to take a closer look I got a strong electric shock and noticed all the wires were exposed.  We asked for this to be fixed along with our daughters fridge in the adjoining room and neither were fixed during our stay. - staff were very friendly - may be luck next time .....thankyou."
"We loved our stay at Bintang Kuta, we were in walking distance to Kuta Square also, rooms were nice, clean, no over bath shower walk in shower was great, with a handheld shower or shower head option. The rooms were cleaned daily, sheets changed daily, linen can be changed daily if required. The staff learnt your names quickly, they were friendly, accommodating and ready to assist you with anything. The hotel is on a busy road but you wouldn't notice this in your rooms, there is no street mouse to disturb you, we had a room overlooking pool was lovely. Our breakfast was provided daily with accommodation, it is a buffet breakfast cap pick is, lattes provided with breakfast at no extra charge. If you like poached or scrambled eggs ask staff to bring to you as its one.ttes or fried eggs in the bsymarie or you can boil your own egg. There is an Asian inspired buffet breakfast also. Pool area is not huge but nice jus the same with a pool bar available also. We also used room service and hotel restaurant for lunch and was very nice and affordable. The accommodation was very affordable and we were also,permitted to use the Ramada Bintangs facilities ."
"I was stay for 2 nights at Bintang Kuta. Really nice staff, very helpful since we are late check-in. Room is very nice& clean. Breakfast variety really good. The other things i love is nearby the hotel beach which can be access thru her sister hotel (Ramada Bintang) just next to this hotel. Consider will try for Ramada Bintang next time. Just takes 10mins to dicovery mall. To access kuta beach maybe will takes 15mins by walking. Swimming pool at Bintang kuta need to be considered since loacated nearby breakfast area."
"Stay in Bintang Kuta = Get Bintang Kuta and Ramada (the more big and expensive sister hotel), since you can use the Ramada big pools with big gardens, personal beach and great activities inside the hotel. Their own pool also child friendly with pool bars. Staffs excellent from frontdesk staffs, pool staffs, breakfast staffs, housekeeping staffs  to security all giving a great service. Location near to Lippo mall, Discovery mall, lots of restaurants, Waterbom but a bit away (still on walking distance)from the hustle bustle legian and kuta beach. Perfect for families."
"The hotel location is quite good near to Waterbom, Discovery Mall and restaurants.
I was told that the hotel is new. It's a four star hotel and we can use it's sister hotel which is located beside Bintang Kuta Hotel. We can use private pool as well as its private beach, though it requires a long walk from our hotel room to reach the beach/pool since we need to pass the hotel lobby and garden.
If you want to walk around Discovery Mall or go to Waterbom it's quite near, about 7-10 mins walk.
Overall it's quite good as you can use facilities while staying at a 4 star hotel."
"I think this hotel is the best value Hotel in Kuta.
Location is great, near everything happening in Kuta, but not that noisy.
And you can use ***** sister Hotel Facilities with pool overlook to the beach and big garden.
Design wise it's very simple, too simple for Balinese Hotel though.
Room is very clean, spacious, comfy.
The amenities were not complete, no toothbrush, toothpaste, only solid soap.
It seems that's a new trend for Hotel in Bali.
I stayed in a some hotel and they don't provide tooth amenities anymore.
Breakfast is OK, q but not the best 4 starts hotel breakfast in Kuta i've stayed.
Check in and out is extremely fast for me.
Too Bad NO WIFI Signal in 4th floor, although i already asked for lower room floor.
Overall it's a satisfying stay."
"We moved to this hotel after staying at another in Legian, predominantly to move closer to where we seemed to be ending up most days (Kuta). New hotel so great rooms and immaculately kept. It's great that it's Ramada owned which gave us access to Ramada Facilities (even though we didn't end up using them). Don't listen to others on here who give bad reviews about breakfast - it was fine. A good selection with any kind of eggs, proper coffee included in the price, cereals, pastries, fruits etc etc. It's about a 20 min walk to Kuta square but 2 mins walk to Lipo Mall which is  brand new. The only slightly negative things would be that the bathroom smelled a bit - nothing that room deodoriser didn't fix, and ordinarily you had to pay for checkout after 1. Beautiful hotel set around a lovely little lagoon pool (with swim up bar). We got it for $60/night on Agoda so were more than happy with it!"
"A very enjoyable stay ,we were not with a group and did our own thing ,the staff worked in with our times for room cleaning etc and were extremely helpful when my wife fell ill at night , rushing her to the clinic for treatment which was arranged by the duty manager .
The Bintang Kuta Hotel gave us freedom of movement to the Bintang Bali Hotel which has private beach access in addition to the pools and other facilities ,well worth the visit ."
"The Bintang Kuta Hotel is located about five minutes from the airport at the southern end of the long beach that stretches from Tuban in the south up through Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. The hotel itself is newly-built along clear, simple lines. The rooms are clean and comfortable. All the facilities are in good condition. The hotel has a moderate-sized pool of its own but it is also connected to the Ramada Bintang next door. There is an air-conditioned lounge and a convenience store on the ground floor. Guests at the Bintang Kuta can use the Ramada’s facilities and these include a huge pool with ample pool beds and umbrellas. The pool leads onto the beach which is spacious but not suitable for swimming here. The breakers are strong and it doesn’t look safe to swim. The beach at Kuta itself, about 2km away, is a bit disappointing, as several tourists have reported. We found the best beach for families located up the road at Seminyak. Double Six beach is about a 15 minute taxi ride from the Bintang and is well worth the trip. Plenty of beach, milder breakers and flat sand that goes out a long way and makes it safe for younger kids to play in the shallows. There are lots of restaurants and a few bars in a short walking distance from the hotel, which is at the family-end of the tourist market. For those looking for the night scene located around the Ground Zero monument, the Bintang is a bit distant. The Bintang Kuta is a very good choice for those not seeking the heavy nightlife and who are happy to pay moderate rates for access to five star hotel facilities."
My stay at the Bintang Kuta Hotel was a very comfortable one. The hotel went out of their way to arrange for a last minute pick up for me and even allowed me to have a friend of mine check in on my behalf because i had to delay my arrival to the next day. Loved how accommodating and understanding the hotel staff were. The room was very comfortable and the pool was gorgeous. Pretty central location and taxis are easily available. Definitely will return.
"Nice quiet hotel, with clean & well maintained facilities. Staff were friendly & welcoming. Breakfasts were fresh & enjoyable. We had adjoining rooms, which were really convenient. The pool was beautiful & clean & quite shaded, so sometimes a bit cool in the afternoon, but this would be great later in the year. Only wish there were balconies on the rooms. This hotel can get a bit overun with chinese people at times, with whole buses arriving quite regularly. Overall a beautiful place to stay on a budget. Would definately recommend the Bintang Kuta."
"The staff were excellent, can't rate them enough. Breakfast was good and plenty there. They will also make eggs anyway you like them plus banana pancakes. Pool bar staff are great and friendly. Prices are on par with hotels, but it's so relaxing who cares. Drivers at the entrance who's rates were the best we had seen. Rooms were clean and made up promptly. The only issue was the smell through the drain in the morning, but for us we didn't care as we were out and about. Room service food is good. Location is a leisurely 10 minute walk to waterbom park and kuta square along street. Or 15 minutes by the beach board walk.  A plus is you can use the ramada pools and amenities, but we didn't bother, as we were happy with the bintang. Can't wait to go back."
"Had a lovely stay at bintang kuta. Smaller sister hotel to ramada bintang so have peace & service of boutique style hotel but can use facilities at the ramada bintang as well. Breakfast was good, usual choices of Asian & western food. Room is lovely although no bath which not problem for us but would disapoint some people...only thing that room didn't have is a balcony which is a bit disappointing. Great location, easy walk to shops, restaurants & bars."
"I stayed with a friend for one night after arriving in Bali.  Kuta is not somewhere I would likely want to spend any time, but this was a great hotel to stay at on arrival day.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.   The hotel is a few minutes walk from the beach which has dark course sand and rocks and a LOT of broken coral at low tide, so not spectacular, but nice to walk along.  The hotel has use of the sister-hotel's pool and beach area, though it has it's own lovely pool.  Breakfast was included with our room and it was the typical mixture of western and asian, so there's something for everyone and seemed to be all-you-can-eat.  We only had two issues:  1. the initial room we were taken to smelled VERy musty, so we asked for another which smelled like it had been sprayed, but turned out to be fine.  2.  The water coming from the shower smelled VERY stronly like sulfur, but after about 30 seconds either I got used to it or it disappeared. :-)  I would stay here again if I needed a hotel close to the airport.  Apparently if you go directly to the taxi stand there should be taxis that would take you here for 60,000 IDR, but we paid 100,000 after bartering.  As traffic was very bad it took an hour so ended up being an ok deal."
"Would have liked a bit more cupboard space eg a chest of drawers under tv would have been great.other than that room was perfect ,king bed was very comfortable, room was spacious and clean,bathroom was clean and lovely.staff wete friendly and efficient.Breakfast was really good.Thoroughly loved staying at Bintang Kuta Hotel will always stay there from now on."
