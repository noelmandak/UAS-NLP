"Pros: 
Love the room. Spacious and clean. 
Love the bunk bed in the room. Perfect for my family. 
We ask for late checkout and it was granted without extra payment. Thank you for that. 
Services was ok. Friendly staffs. 
Cons: 
Need more pillow. One is not enough and its too soft. 
Toilet was small. 
The table was shaky. Had to be careful not to break it. 
The bottled water had metal cap that you need to use a bottle opener. We didnt know where was the bottle opener. On our 3rd day that we realise the opener was in the toilet. 
TV was small. Limited channels."
"I've stayed at many hotels, but would have to say that the Mercure at Legian exceed expectations.  It was a great location, with everything from good restaurants,  food and massages in the area, yet still quiet for a good night rest. The rooms were clean, staff were always friendly and facilities were great for a 4 star standard hotel, it definitely was better value than I had come to expect. Hotels in the region always require maintenance,  and considering the offering it wasn't too bad off the mark, maybe 1/2 star off but made up in other areas."
"Close to shops and restaraunts, 
Room clean, staff friendly.
Buffet breakfast average but it was included so cant really complain.
Top pool seems dated"
"i am a Solo Indian traveller . stayed here for 11 days . 
Positive 
1) clean place 
2) daily cleaning 
3) amazing staff 
4) good food 
5) amazing pool 
cons 
1) break fast is good but i felt a bit bored eating same stuff every day 
message to mercure 
1) please add ayam geprek and more indo food to your menu"
Andy and Helen were very helpful with the check-in process. We stayed here 3 years ago pre-covid and were very happy with this stay. Tourists are returning and the area is getting back to normalcy. Facility is clean and safe.
"Staying for a mates birthday the room type we picked was perfect for myself and a mate to share. We had friends in pool rooms so made it easy for us to all hang out together. Breakfast choice was huge and catered to all and location is fantastic to moneychanger BMC, the beach, Restaurants,  garlic lane and Legian Food Court. Clean, well maintained and great staff."
This property is smack bang in the heart of everything. Great location and the staff are very welcoming and friendly. The Buffett breakfast was huge and the hotel did some great drink specials with a DJ next to the roof top pool on the Saturday evening.
"Amazing hotel. Clean, staff just beautiful and always there to help at the drop of a pin"
It was a pleasant stay because the room is great and there are a wide variety of food during breakfast. Staffs are great and responsive. Facilities are complete and in perfect condition.
"Would definitely stay here again.. location was great, cheap and clean. Two pools and lots of sun… shopping, food, circle k and laundry right across the road… 
Staff super helpful"
"You will get:
1. Clean room
2. Strategic location
3. Safe
4. Convenient
5. Value for money
6. Fast and hassle free check-in / out."
"Everything was beautiful!
From the moment we checked in, everyone was lovely & accomodating, the food was beautiful, the spa was my favourite and we’d definitely stay there again. The staff loved our baby daughter and were so kind."
We stayed here for a week in a King room with plunge pool which we thoroughly enjoyed. Good location to Jl Legian and Jl Melasti. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Only disappointment was with the breakfast but I’m guessing that there may still be some issues with Covid impacting on buffet stay or meals. Otherwise it was a fabulous stay
"Loved our stay at Mercure Legian, have already rebooked. Room was amazing g with its own plunge pool. Couldn’t be more impressed"
Warm welcome received for our large group of 13. We booked at a promotional rate which made our stay incredible value. Double Rooms are good in size for a couple and the family rooms are great for 6/7 year olds. Handy location with enough to see and do from the doorstep and despite being centrally located we had no noise pollution in our rooms. The only thing to fault is that two of our kids received reasonable cuts to their feet in the upper level pool which we suspect would have been from loose tiles as glass wear isn’t used poolside. It’s hard to avoid these accidents when you can’t see what’s going on under water but the issue was reported to staff to address. Other than that we are really pleased with the service/staff/facilities/value included in our package.
"Lovely hotel. In 10 days there I never had a hot shower. No hot water. Being a smoker the only place to smoke is next to the open food area. Shouldn’t be able to smoke near other people eating. Couldn’t smoke at the pool. So I won’t be staying there again. If a non smoker, a perfect place to stay."
"I’m travelling as a single mother with my five month old son, I was a bit nervous as it’s our first trip overseas but the staff here are so lovely and so great with kids and it’s really value for money I’m really happy with the choice I made to stay here."
"Great hotel, friendly staff, very clean and nice food. A bit far from the beach for us. Great restaurant, money changer and laundry across the road and close to many other great restaurants' nearby."
"Your room was clean and comfortable. But idk where is the opener for your metal cap mineral water.
Breakfast was good. But not many choices in main course. Kwetiau and Chocolate Croissant have standard taste. There's Fresh Juice that you can make by yourself. Really love it!"
"a compliment for 1 of their FO staff (Ardi - Man with sunglasses) who handled my request during C/I & handled my complain when i entered my room.......Thx for your hospitality! 
The breakfast variant was not so good, less variant of the food. 
You should asked to their  kitchen staff to get Pork Bacon (Heyy......you're Int'l chain & this is bali)..........
Some guest can get Cappuccino while the others NO!"
"Staff at Mercure could not do enough to make all guests feel welcome. Reception, room cleaners, pool attendants, breakfast staff — every employee deserved to be recognised for their efforts."
"Great location,staff great,ideal for couples or family or solo traveler's,definitely stay here again,"
Great hotel for this price and best location
"1. Laundry kiloan and Circle K in front of the hotel
2. Close to many restaurant 
3. Next to Brunch club for fancy breakfast"
Very nice.  Clean and comfortable.
"Enjoyed,  will stay again"
Good location and great rooms. The only downside was no balcony.
"Everything's very okay here.
Thank you for your hospitality."
Really enjoy this hotel. The atmosphere was good. 👍👍
All the managers  and staff work very well together and help out as much as they can wonderful stay thank you for the great hospitality
Just an amazing place to be in Bali - worth every bit of your stay.
"Great location, close to everything, has 2 pools a nice restaurant & the staff are all lovely0"
"The staff here are friendly, wonderful and very helpful.  My partner was sick on the day that we arrived, so they organised earlier check in so we did not have to wait around. The service was amazing, the food was delicious! And the amenities  are better than what you would get at home. Loved our visit. Thank you!"
Location wonderful.... near great places to eat and things to do.  We both love it
"Nice hotel, located in the middle of tourism attaction."
Pasti balik kesini lagi soon
"Nice clean Necure standards as you would expect,good location, nice rooms."
"Great stay,clean hotel,good cocktails by pool,feel safe being there by myself,location is perfect"
Facilities are good quality
Good in everything
Will be bqck
Will be bqck
"Friendly staff, nice rooms, great location."
"I was staying for 3 nights at mercure legian, the location is very strategic, I can go anywhere because the hotel is in the center area. Room was clean, but pillows were only given 2 pcs, I requested for 2 more."
staff ramah ramah
"Mecure Legian is situated on the crossroads of Kuta, Legian and near Seminak. Great amenities and close to nearby restaurants and outlets. My only gripe was that although there was no smoking advertised the hotel made exceptions with patrons using their meeting rooms which makes this discriminatory to patrons following rules by smoking near the outside parameters of the hotel. Thanks"
"apart from it being your run of the mill chain hotel it was clean and the staff were great.
like most of Bali accommodations right now it needed a little maintenance but that didn't leave a sour taste for us.
I met our requirements for our short stay in Kuta and was a great location."
breakfast a bit boring. same dishes everyday
We ordered room service almost everyday and the food was amazing!
"Staff and location were faultless.
Some rooms smelled mouldy as no windows to open. I paid to be upgraded to balcony room with no hassles. Pools are great. Breakfast is very average. The staff make this place ."
"kulkas nya rusak :(
but overall it's good and even the staffs are helpfull.."
"We went there just to spend a night before heading to nusa penida. Nothing bad in particular except the room is very dark. Location wise, it is pretty strategic being able to access to many restaurants and famous beach club."
Strategic location and close to shops and restaurant and walking distance to Kuta beach.
Great location
"Check in okey, staff friendly, room clean and generous,  location good.  Everything is good, except breakfast, because breakfast buffet  not much to choose. I think better book room without breakfast."
"We've stayed a couple times now. It's easy, familiar and great location to things we like in Legian. Having said that, the Mecure badly needs a facelift especially the rooms. It doesn't appear any money has been spent on it since we stayed 4 years ago. So the rooms are looking very tired. Unfortunately the food has gone down in standard too. The staff are friendly enough but nothing like the service we got in other areas of Bali such as Canggu and Ubud. They wouldn't accept my debit card for security against possible costs we might incurr during the stay even though I use this card everywhere else. This needs to be amended as it's embarrassing being asked to pay as you go for an extra cappuccino at breakfast time or pay cash on the spot like a criminal. Never had this issue anywhere else. Most Aussies use debit cards these days far better han using 20% credit cards. Things have changed. Please fix these things and then we will be back each year ."
Parking lot quite big. The hot water is not working properly.
"Breakfast was excellent although not many available spaces for smoker but the room is excellent, wifi signal is excellent and tv channel already digital"
"So far so good.  The staff are great and very accomodating.   Had a problem with the small fridge in the room when we first arrived but they changed it straight away. Breakfasts are very good, no complaints, plenty and varied food   So far it has been fantastic"
"Legian Mercure is clean,well run. great location close to many shops, restaurant and the beach.i would stay here again."
"I don't know what to write. All good and i like it :D
PS: Breakfast are so-so due the pandemic"
"Good hotel , excellent location in Legian. 
Friendly staff and good service.
Only one negative, the room fridge either doesn’t work or just NOT cold enough!"
"Have stayed on previous occasions, this time brekkie a little disappointed, food not hot fewer choices, making up of rooms each day not sufficient"
Very nice hotel.  Good rooms.  Great facilities.  Staff needs to be better
Noisy traffic constant day and night. Staff very helpful. Buffet breakfast was hit and miss... Slow to top up the food however once you got it the food was good. 3.5 * is probably a fairer rating.
The hotel is good n location very convenient
"If you see all the picture in the listing, it was different when you arrived at the hotel. but for the price that you can compare around kuta still reasonable. the pool at the 4th floor its not clean. for the room that have bunk bed, i dont like the lighting, its to dark. breakfast also not so many good taste. but for that price near kuta its value for your money"
Rooms clean.first night very musty smell.limited service.great staff.all in all good for fovid times
I have experienced lukewarm water from shower head and the sink is partially choke.
Will be back
"Been staying at the Mercure for years. 1st time back after covid.  The hotel is in need of a renovation. However, saying that it’s still pretty good value for money. The most disappointing change I noticed was the breakfast. Used to be fantastic but now very poor."
Nothing much to complain about… some facilities need some works…
"Badly in need of funding for change of upholstery, linen, lights and pillows. We stayed in a deluxe room with plunge pool costing us 2x the amnt we paid for our stay in element Ubud. We were not ready for the bad lighting( room was too dark even during daytime) , damp room, moldy pool sofa and stained  pillows.  The staff were polite and helpful though.  Chose this hotel bec it is a Mercure brand from the accor group. Didn't  live up to our Accor expectations. So disappointed that they dont have conditioner ,lotion and you couldn't  ask for an extra bottle of water ( which was housed in a refillable glass bottle ). What would it cost to give another bottle a day?? A few cents? Couldn't  fault the staff it was probably a (poor)  management  ruling. Wouldn't  come back even if prices were slashed by half. .."
"Some building works taking place during my stay, could hear hammer drills occasionally. What ever was going on in the room above was waking me up late at night and early morning. Constant banging and furniture being moved around. Noise penetrating through floor easily..Rooms very outdated and deteriorated over the years. Bathroom / shower doesn’t look clean, mould / grime  etc ground into the shower from the years of use..
Hotel is in an ideal location , breakfast buffet is reasonable., staff polite and helpful. Pool area upstairs isn’t very big .
If your not planning on spending much time in the hotel and on a budget, then this place would be ok."
"Overall just ok for a night stay. Hotel was little bit run down/ overall I would rate 3/5. 
Location : 5:5
Hotel stay :3/5 
Night sleep :3 /5
Facilities : 3/5
Restaurant /breakfast : 4/5 
Staff : 3/5 ( less communication only see staff in reception / no bellman upon check in."
"Clean and  western style.  Good location.  Could have been anywhere in world, didn’t really have any Bali feel except breakfast options.  Full Asian style buffet with some western options."
unfortunately this is not the same place we stayed at just a few years ago. everything is rundown and broken. wont be back anytime soon.
"a lot of fruit flies in the room, breakfast is simple and clean, staff are nice."
Trying to keep in mind they are getting over Covid break but as the hotel is very busy you would think they would check each room before hiring out.  Our safe didn’t work which they replaced.  The fridge stunk and was hot and replaced following day.  The toilet was constantly trickling.  The aircon leaked and left floor wet.  Man came to fix.  He didn’t come back so asked to change rooms a couple of days later.  No problems in new room.  Breakfast was very adverage.  Rooms were clean and staff were nice
"Location is a little bit far from beach , you need to walk about 15 minutes. Bar, local store, and restaurant nearby. Room is clean. Staff attitude at recepcionist need to fix, while she check me in , someone try to cut what she doin and makes me wait so long."
well located and Staffs are nice and kind. But They are late response. Housekeeping was so bad and unclean. They don't change towels (keep apolzising but they don't change unless I called to recepntion 2 times everyday.) Housekeeper problem I believe. NOT efficient price comparing to even other Bali cheaper hotels. Not recommended.
Guess due to Covid - the rooms and facilities are run down. I guess every property in Bali is the same.
"Not worth the money paid mould on shower tiles , tiles lifting in small pool 
Balcony door unlock properly and someone come up twice. Try and fix. 
Fridge needed to be changed 
Was given a room right next  lifts was very noisy.
Also on busy street corner which made it even more noisy 
Breakfast average overall  better places to stay at"
"The area itself was already quite, they only open 2 floors 1-2, pool on 4th floor like in their images was closed, staff kinda annoyed when we ask details about facilities that we got and even just to ask extra pillow since they only give 2( usually 4 right) so we only got 1 extra.. overall services were not so good and feels like they just don’t care whatever happen and they just do their job. Won’t come back 👍🏼"
I asked reservation to GM and staff to extend my stay not thru Agoda. Totally no response!
"Surrounding looks old, not for holiday. Maybe one might stay is fine."
"We had a bad experience stayed here. Room was unprepared well. The bunkbed was crack on its stairs, pillow improperly used, aircon fan was broken. Weird was theres many room with open door all the way the coridors, maybe its broken room or something, but it gave a spooky experience. Really not comfort to stayed at this hotel. Need improve a lot for the 4 star standard."
Not a good choice for a hotel in Bali there are way better options!
"I am a Taiwanese who work in Indonesia over 10 years. I been to Bali for 2-day weekend in February. I saw many China people and some Taiwanese travelers who lived in Mercure Bali Legian however there is no Mandarin channel on the TV list? There is the low traveling season in Bali now, however you can see the travler Bali over 70% is China people and Taiwanese, it's amazing!!
If the Westerners prefer outdoor activities in Bali rather than stay in hotel, for what reason that hotel purchased International channel such HBO and FOX...hotel wasted money on those useless channels.
On the contrary, most China and Taiwan people rather stay in hotel to watch the Mandarin channel they prefer at night.
I think over 4 or 5 stars hotel should be equiped Mandarin channel to service Chinese traveler, you can find so amazing consumption power from China people in every coutry, especially there are over 70% China people who live in your hotel. Think about it!"
i CANNOT RECOMMEND THE MERCURE LEGIAN  BALI  HIGHLY ENOUGH. FROM THE MINUTE OF YOUR ARRIVAL TIL YOU DEPART THE EXPERIENCE IS ONE OF GREAT DELIGHT. ALL STAFF ARE HIGHLY TRAINED AND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE. THE BREAKFASTS ARE DELIGHTFUL AS ARE THE STAFF IN THE DINING AREA. THE STAFF IN RECEPTION ARE ALSO A PLEASURE. I RECOMMEND STAFF MEMBER MELISA IN RESERVATIONS VERY HIGHLY AS SHE ALSO KNOWS HER JOB VERY WELL AND IS A VERY PLEASANT YOUNG LADY. SECURITY IS VERY RELIABLE ALSO.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE STAYING IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN AND POSSIBLY AGAIN.  GREAT WORK EVERYONE XX
"Having stayed at many Mercures throughout sea east Asia, I definatley would rate the staff at Mercure Legian the most friendly & helpful nothing is to much trouble from check in to check out was perfect. 
Location : just a short stroll to the clubs and restruants in Kuta and a 5 min walk to the beach 
Rooms: good size clean, airconditioner was sufficient, bed was comfy enough but not a fan of the super soft pillows 
Food: only had the breaky one day it was OK as far as hotel buffets go 
Pools: 2 pools I preferred the upstairs pool on the 4th floor super chilled out area very relaxing highly recommend checking this pool area out 
The pool on the ground floor next to the restruant is more more family friendly for the little ones. 
I would definatley recommend this property."
"We enjoyed our stay at the Mercure Bali Legian however there were a few things to be improved on.  We had a balcony that overlooked the upstairs pool area.  Unfortunately there was no outdoor furniture provided - we used the inside chair and requested another chair brought up.  It would have also been nice to have a airing horse to hang wet bathers, towels and washing on.  The other thing that annoyed me was there was no outside ceiling light and so you couldn't sit on the balcony and read.  The two little lights in the wall were insufficient.  Inside, the shower was very good, plenty of hot water and good water pressure.
Again not enough lighting in the room (no ceiling light).  Also would be good if more hangers in wardrobe and 2 spare pillows.
We had the bbq dinner next to the pool one night which was very nice."
"My stay at Mercure Legian was great, couldn't fault it Food good Staff were fantastic, Pool area lovely 
Rooms nice and very clean. I travelled with my daughter son in law and 2 teenagers also another family of 4 and we all loved it and would stay again.I would suggest to warn people of the step in the lobby going out to Legian rd end."
"We had a great stay at the mercure legian. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast buffet was fantastic. The hotel and the room we stayed in was very clean and modern. The main pool area was great for children and adults. The beach was only about a 15 minute walk. There are many shops and restaurants right outside the door. The restaurant was lovely but a bit pricy. Warning don't get laundry done here, it costed my friends $80 but only only paid $7 across the road for about the same amount!"
"We recently stayed at the Mercure Bali Legian Hotel for a week.  We have wanted to stay here for quite some time, given the location and pools etc.  Whilst the location is excellent and the staff are really lovely, the rooms and facilities really need a refurb.  You pay pretty top whack to stay here because of the location.  We have stayed in plenty of other resorts and hotels for much less with better facilities.  I am not sure that we will be back anytime soon unless it has some major refreshing done... equally the price is up there for the standard of hotel it is..."
"We usually stay at dynasty which is amazing but we decided to check Mercure family room out and it was also amazing we have not one complaint rooms are modern and very clean, staff are friendly and very helpful, pools are great, food in the hotel is also good value for money when we stay at dynasty the food is not the best but definitely Mercure chef has the menus spot on. We will definitely be coming back to Mercure again."
"Lovely hotel in the Main Street of legian area, close to shops, beach and bars.
Spacious rooms with quality bedding and ample storage space.
The staff were really lovely and accommodating all request efficiently.  Check in was slow, but there was a confusion with the type of room I booked, but the welcome drink and lobby area was fine for the wait.  
Restaurant staff were very good, alothough the breakfast selection was quite limited for fresh fruit, no granolas or healthy options really...juice from concentrate etc. bit disappointing, but adequate for the price.  Room service was fine- although I went down to check out the full menu and ordered from there as the 'room service menu' is very limited for vegetarian options."
The Mercure Bali Legian Hotel was fabulous we will be booking again in April.
"Room, staffs, breakfast, pool are great!! That's good experience to stay there. We will back to stay at Mercure Legian Bali."
We had a short stay at the Mercure in Legian but it was clean and comfortable and in a great location! The pools were great and the food by the pool was fantastic! We would stay again and would recommend this Hotel to anyone!
"After staying at numerous hotels in Bali this was probably our favourite hotel. Really modern rooms and lovely pool area. The pool area did get quite busy however the staff were really good and would remove towels after half an hour or so if people put towels down to reserve beds without being there. Excellent location, just far enough out from kuta to avoid the noise but only a 15 min walk to the main bars. Also only a 10 min walk to the beach. Overall for the price of this hotel you can't go wrong."
"I booked the deluxe room for my stay. However, to my surprise, the hotel kindly upgraded me to Executive Suite. What a wonderful surprise. Location of the hotel is superb as it is only 20 mins away from the airport, and plenty of shops and restaurants around the hotel area. The only downside was there was a lot of traffic noise as it is located by the main road of Legian area. Room service was okay. Swimming pool is not too big but still okay too. Overall, I enjoyed my one night stay here."
"The location is great! Shops, eateries, local massage palours all available just outside the hotel.  Legian beach is within walking distance too. The Superior room is of a decent size and the king bed is heavenly. Room is very clean too. Did not purchase the hotel breakfast so can't comment on that. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. Even though there are two pools, one on the 4th floor and the other on the ground floor, there are still insufficient deck chairs! But overall, I totally enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Will definitely go back again."
"The Mercure Legian is perfectly located right next to restaurants, shops and money exchange bank. It is also close to Kuta and Seminyak and a short walk to the beach. The staff are very friendly and the facilities are well kept."
"I stayed with my wife and our toddler for the holiday. Hotel was ideally situated, close to the beach and plenty of restaurants and cafe nearby. They also have a kids club. Clean room and comfortable bed, the towels were slightly worn out but the rest of the amenities are fine. Room service took longer than expected, maybe its because of the high occupancy. Food was alright as expected from a mercure chain hotel. Overall still a great stay."
"Resort style hotel right at legian street. Easy access to everywhere. We always hop hotels in bali, this is one hotel where we feel relaxed and calm once inside, yet outside the hotel theres life. Comfortable rooms, friendly staff all over.  Highly recommended for those who want to relax in the middle of town and yet can still  enjoy outside this hotel.  Good stay we extended from a night till 3 nights."
This hotel is ideally located in the corner of the intersection which links between Kuta and Legian. This hotel is relatively new and opened its door about a year ago. The surrounding is ok and it has two swimming pools but it's not big enough for me and the room is quite nice but again a bit small for the price I pay. The breakfast menu is so so. One thing I am very satisfied is that I left my smartphone inside my room when checking out. In a few hour later I got a call from the housekeeping that they have found my smartphone and I was so happy. It's not about the price of the smartphone I would have lost but it's the honesty of the housekeeping that I am happy for. Such person is very few in this world. Thank you.
"I only stayed 1 night, it was my last day of my trip in Bali. 
Surely will choose this hotel on my next visit when I want to stay in Legian."
Check in was smooth. Room was very clean. We wanted to try their spa package but unfortunately it was fully booked. Make sure to book their spa early if you want to try it. And breakfast was excellent with plenty of choices and they offered fresh juice. The hotel is just a 5 minutes walk to the famous Kuta/Legian Beach.
"Stayed here for 2 nights, the location was great, near to the Kuta beach. The staff is very kind and helpful. The rooms are comfortable,  the balcony is spacious."
"Hood hotel average pool ,good location"
"Bagus bgt hotelnya, worth every the price!!"
Very nice room and great location. Would stay here again.
Well recommended
"despite being a 4-star group of Accor, this hotel is like no other. The check-in process is slow, the majority of the front office staff are good, but there's one that's very annoying which unluckily was the one who handled my check-out (and check-in for the following day with another name)."
After long time got the best hotel. Staff was so friendly and helpful. The great location. So clean and comfortable. Morning breakfast so delicious and veriaty of food. Money we paid really worth. No hesitation to recommend to anyone. Definitely we go back again.
"Overall best experience, the king room was spacious, they have 2 pools. Minus the refrigerator isn’t cool, it can’t be used to safe cold drink."
Way over priced Aircon not that cold fridge not working and food overpriced damp wall in room and mold
This hotel is location on very good location. You can access all of interesting place in legian from this hotel
"The Mercure was very cloce to everything, Shops,Restaurants  Markets, Beach .Have been there two times and will go back again"
