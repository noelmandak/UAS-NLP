"Hidden away behind a restaurant and carpark, Taman Harum is an oasis in the midst of a busy community. The hotel facilities are excellent, the staff ever helpful, and the landscaping exceptional. The lush greenery surrounding the rooms and the pool are exceptional. If you step outside into the bustling community, you will find a vast array of restaurants as well as museums and genuine woodcraft workshops. Taman Harum spells out comfort, authenticity and relaxation. It is truly a hidden gem."
we were so so happy that we have chooses this hotel.  Best selection we have ever made.  and staffs are so so adorable ☺️
"I like this cottage very much, easy to find location, good facilities, very helpful staf, and also perfect place for take a relaxation."
"We stayed for 39 days at Taman Hurum Cottages.
Staff are all friendly and the room is clean and tidy.
I and my daughter had allergic reaction due to dirtiness of AC, and I asked staff to arrange the cleaning.  They’ve arranged professional AC cleaning promptly, so our allergic reaction disappeared soon.
There’s kitchen in common area, so I could cook dinner for my kids and it helped me a lot.
I will be surely back in Taman Harum Cottages for the next travel to Ubud.
Thanks to all the staff!!"
staff very helpful and friendly. Well-maintained facilities and shady gardens. Fast wi-fi connection. Highly recommended and I'd love to stay here again.
"we only stayed for 3 nights in superior room, but the facilities they had just beyond our expectations, they have yoga studio, lil library, pool, billyard, resto & gelato
we also had good breakfast
thank you & see u soon
will definitely back to stay here again"
"We had wonderful holidays at Taman Harum ! We were there for 8 days and we absolutely do not regret our choice ! 
LOCATION : A bit far from Ubud Center ( approx 15 min) but a shuttle is available all day until 10pm on request ! 
ROOM: We got firstly a room which was not the size we expected. But the room was clean and nice, just a truly lack of light. After talking with the staff we got the possiblity to change for a more spacious room. This one was clean as well and the outside bathroom was nice. It was quiet and bedding is very good quality. They also lend you adaptator !
CLEANLINESS : Good in general but big stains on the white towels. AIR CON : Air conditioning was not super cold
RESTAURANT : The food is good, not too expensive and there are few restaurants around. 3 littles supermakets around !
POOL : The pool was very very nice and clean ! Pool towels always available.  
SPA: It was good and clean
We do recommend this place  !"
"Nice rooms, polite staff, convenient location. Thank you!"
Awesome stay in Ubud. Nice room and facility. Free shuttle to Ubud Center. Great breakfast.
"Fantastic stay, beautiful room, great brekkie options, great pool. Yes it’s a little way out of Ubud, but free shuttle there and back at any time plus no noise from all the bars."
The staff are so friendly and the pool is nice.
We stayed as a couple with an 11 year old in the 2 bedroom villa. The hotel is older but provided a very comfortable stay for 3 nights. The shower need fixing as water is slow. Beautiful sunrises can be observed from the rooftop! Food was ok from the restaurant.
The rooms and the towels could be a little bit more clean. The room is simple
"This was our second stay at Taman Harum, having stayed with them 2 years ago for roughly the same length of time. Both times we have been impressed and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The place is beautifully set out with lush gardens and a nice pool area with a good amount of privacy. The staff are always attentive, friendly and professional and make you feel like a welcome guest. This time we stayed in one of the 2-storey cottages close to the the pool and it had recently been renovated. It was well set out, clean and quite homely. The beds were comfortable, the aircon fantastic and the bathroom was beautiful to look at with a new bath, huge shower and nice vanity area. Unfortunately the large shower area was wasted because of the water pressure so ideas of a hot shower for two rapidly faded as I rotated myself around the light stream of water. Apart from that the water was always hot and adequate for a one-person shower. The breakfast is OK, with three options and the meals area, like all other parts of the hotel is attractive and nice to be in. 
Overall we again found Taman Harum to be an experienced and professionally run hotel and we were more than happy with our stay here. We definitely recommend it. (After staying here we spent another 4 days in Seminyak and realised just how good we'd had it at Taman Harum. We stayed at a recently opened hotel called Aqua Villa which was run by young, inexperienced staff. The contrast was amazing and we were very disappointed, but it highlighted how well-run and professional Taman Harum is.)"
"A lovey place with an inviting pool, wonderful tropical foliage, a master wood-carver and museum on site.  Handy free shuttle to and from nearby Ubud.  Excellent concierge service. Restaurant with room service available from early am to 10 pm or so.  Staff are attentive and lovely people.  On-site massage is excellent and yet dirt cheap!   Our room was a splurge for us and some of the best money we spent on a four-nation seven-week tour.  While Bali itself did not meet all of our expectations the good people and facilities at Taman Harum Cottages exceeded expectations at every turn and made for a great week there."
"If you came all the way to Bali because you love to jostle with the shopping crowds, dodge traffic and stare down the tourist touts of Ubud, you're not going to like this hotel. Taman Harum is intensely quiet, unpretentious, and timeless in the Balinese tradition. When I stepped out of the car here, I thought there was some mistake, I had been dropped at one of the Indiana Jones-type Hindu temples that are ubiquitous in Bali. Well yes, I was, and I wasn't. It has the same lost-jungle-antiquity feel, but also the comfortable spaces, precise detailing and attentive-yet-invisible service that marks the places the you want to come back to again and again. The dining room does a very credible job, the pool is delightful, the spa will lull you to sleep, and lush gardens tie everything together. Even the most basic rooms have an open-air garden in the bathroom. Inviting seating areas unfold everywhere. Nobody is pressuring you to do do this or that tour, chilling with a book highly approved. Breakfast is ordered from a multi-cultural menu. The wifi works. The hotel staff will drive you to neaby Ubud any time you want -- but one look at that zoo and I wanted run screaming back to Taman Harum."
"Perfect. The location is far enough away from Ubud to find peace, quiet, and space. They offered free shuttle services anywhere in Ubud. 5 min drive from monkey forest. The restaurant food and staff is excellent. The pool and spas were unmatched. We spent 10 days and they helped us to organize all the activities we wanted to do. Including riding elephants, monkey forest, various temples, snorkeling, scuba diving, full body massages, cultural events like dancea, wood carving, and painting. We also saw the live volcano kintamani, and the drivers they provided were fair priced. Our room was always clean, safe, and air conditioned. And the price was a huge plus for us. We will definitely be coming back with friends and family. Thanks Taman Harum for making our stay so remarkebly unforgettable."
"We had a lovely 10 day stay at Taman Harum. The room we were first given wasn't the best for 10 nights but the staff had no trouble changing us to a more comfortable one for the longer stay. We had a lovely cottage with it's own little courtyard with luscious plants, statues and a waterfall. The room was cleaned every day with fresh sheets and towels and nothing was too hard for the staff.
The food at the restaurant was lovely - breakfast was good and dinner was delicious.
The staff were great at organising outings and also our motorbike, which we hired for the whole duration.
Thank you guys at Taman Harum - you made our stay a very relaxing and enjoyable one."
"My partner and I enjoyed our stay at Taman Harum Cottages. It was convenient that they accepted both IDR currency or USD if you will. Around bali though, USD is not favored. The location of Taman Harum was close to Ubud by the provided shuttle bus of the hotel. Don't try attempting to walk to out as you will be lost and it's not worth it in the heat.

At Taman, you get to experience cooking classes with a local visit to the Marketing in the morning which was nice, (you can get your guide to help you bargain prices during this visit, as the Ubud market sells not only foodstuff but also nice rattan bags, Sarongs, and things like essential oil etc).

We got to learn to paint batik at 10USD per person which was a nice experience. Missed out of Padi field walking sessions as it wasn't the right season and they weren't planting Padi.

Inside the hotel, the room was spacious but non amenities nor beauty kits provided. Only thing available in the bathroom was Shampoo and shower gel. So bring your own toothbrushes etc. 

If transport is needed, you get better price getting a driver touting his services in ubud town, then the hotel provided and chargeable services to say the airport or trips that run outside of the Shuttle provided service. 

Anything you do, just remember to bargain!"
"We loved our stay at Taman Harum Cottages. The free transport meant that we could go in and out of Ubud at any time, including evenings to visit restaurants.This hotel is in the village of Mas, 10 mins drive from Ubud, but it was so peaceful to return to this place after the crazy , busy streets of Ubud. Lovely clean pool, quiet rooms, gorgeous staff. Only downfalll was a lack of english TV, but a dvd player and free movies was provided. Would happily return anytime !"
"Taman Harum hotel is locates outside Ubud.
But don’t let the location trick you. The hotel offers Shute traffic to and from Ubud, so you can enjoy Ubud but then leave for some pease.
The restaurant at the hotel is located just by the road, and it can sometimes be a little noisy, but you can have the food served at your room.
There is a spa in the hotel, they offer really good treatments at a very competitive price.
The personnel is really helpful and assist you in anything from restaurant recommendations to booking tours.
There is a pool that our kids enjoyed a lot after going in to Ubud with us.
We would most likely stay here for our next trip to Ubud."
"It was a very relaxing stay. We looked for a hotel that is quiet, not in the city/touristic area, but with a quick access to city conveniences. Taman Harum fits into the profile. It felt more like staying at home with hotel service, making it hard to leave after staying there for 9 days. Staff were very helpful and friendly. the hotel shuttle car picked up and took us to Ubud center anytime (9am-10pm) anywhere. Will definitely stay here again. Very good value for money."
The room was first class and beautifully maintained ...  staff very friendly and helpful and the gardens superb.   The Taman Harum Cottages are impossible to beat in terms of value.  Shuttle service flexible and efficient.  We will be tstaying there again next year which will be our 21st visit to Bali.
"Taman Harum Cottage is located slightly off the busy Ubud centre. The decor of the hotel is lovely. It's surrounded by greenery and has quite a lot of facilities (reading room, garden, swimming pool, yoga room) inside. The room was good. The bathroom in our room was almost half the size of our room, very spacious. Internet in our room was quite weak, had access to wifi only at the reception. The hotel has a regular shuttle service all the way till 10 PM to Ubud centre which is very convenient. You don't have to worry about getting to Ubud (which is around 30-40 mins drive) from the hotel. The hotel breakfast was not the usual buffet which was a momentary disappointment for us, since we enjoy indulging in a variety of dishes at breakfast buffets. They provide breakfasts sets. You can choose one of the 3-4 options available. The breakfast was really good and filling. So you won't really miss the traditional breakfast buffets during your stay here.  Amazing peaceful stay!"
"""Taman Harum"" or in English Pleasant Scent Garden, away from the City of Kuta nearer to the Ubud town, suitable for Family with Children or even Single who wanted a quiet getaway from the buzzling city. Serenity will greet you the moment you enter the area. Full of Bali's local plants and tropical trees. Your accommodation await you (18 unit only). Grab a bite at the Hotel  restaurant or even sign up for them to teach you. Enjoy a spa session to end the evening. A recommended getaway."
"the staff at taman harum made our stay very memorable and went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay in ubud. nothing was trouble and they arranged everything we requested with a smile. the rooms are spacious, clean and have a peaceful energy to them. food is good and overall i would definitely be back there. although it is a little out of ubud town centre, it was nice to go into town for the day and return to the smaller village in the evenings.  thanks to everyone for a great holiday - i'll be back for sure. xx"
"Me and my partner stayed at Taman Harum for two weeks and we absolutely loved it. The staff is amazing, they were always helpful with any requests we had. There's a lovely restaurant woth delicious food, really nice pool, you can do many various lessons, have massages, book tours... everything one needs for a great stay. Also this place is owned by Balinese people which means that you're not giving your money to one of the internationally owned big hotels that drain the island, export the money and treat staff badly."
"the friendly and welcoming staff at taman harum made this a great place to stay. situted in the village of mas, the hotel is out of the centre of ubud (which was a good thing for me) but they have a shuttle bus that will take you in and pick you up whenever you want. nice area to walk around too - can get to local villages and rice fields easily. hotel could recommend and book lots of activities and good drivers to get further afield. the room was a bit dark and damp but pretty clean and comfortable. no cable tv in rooms but there is a dvd player and selection of dvds to borrow. restaurant was nice but quiet and breakfast choice a bit limited. pool very nice but small so got crowded at busy times. overall, a great choice if you want somewhere quiet and out of town."
"The grounds and buildings at Taman Harum were beautiful. It has a nice pool and a wood carving galleries. The food was good, with 2 restaurants.  It is a bit far from everything, but they do have a shuttle bus that goes to Ubud. The internet wasn't good. It was hard to find good reception as it kept coming and going. The staff were great, especially Pande, Ngurar and Nika.  I enjoyed my week at Taman Harum Cottages."
"I've returned to Taman Harum many, many times.  Although in Mas, rather than Ubud, the availability of a free shuttle all day and evening is a great service and avoids the busier climate of central Ubud.  Beautiful art gallery (wood carving)."
"Have been coming to Taman Harum for many years. In family group, with friends, alone and as a couple. Always friendly staff great breakfasts lovely setting. Good food at Thor restaurant. Transport into Ubud provided if want to join the crowds or shop eat etc
 Highly recommend"
"Our stay at Taman Harum was very great! all the staff are friendly and very accommodating. Though their location is quite away from the center, their free shuttle service makes everything fine. Highly recommended for honeymooners or for those who want to have a silent and relaxing stay."
"my husband and i spent four days at this lovely hotel.  we had the suite which was a self contained, high walled enclosed area of indoor/outdoor living with a private entrance to the pool.  the only room entirely closed in was the bedroom. it was beautifully furnished and very private.
my husband had just flown in from canada so this was a perfect place to adjust to the time change and relax.  the food in the restaurant was good.  i have been living in indonesia for the last seven months so i, of course, thought the food was fantastic:i had been craving western style food. but my husband also found it very good.
the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. when you want to go into ubud, the front desk will provide a complimentary car and driver for you. you can either prearrange a pick-up time from ubud or phone them. they are very flexible and willing to help. the hotel also can provide a number of day trips to various sites.
this area is well known for its wood carving and the hotel has a carving centre attached to it with an overwhelming display of beautiful carvings."
"i had a wonderful experience in taman harum cottages hotel! i love this place so much! ppl there are so kind and helpful! the breakfasts were so nice, especially the papaya juice! the hotel has their own car to fetch you wherever you want to, and pick up at the place which you wish to! ya, i love it so much!"
"Staff were very friendly and helpful. My husband even received an arrangement of flowers for his birthday! 
It was very quiet at the Taman and tranquil. The gardens were absolutely beautiful. 
The transport to and from Ubud was also fabulous. It made going out for the evening meal or doing a bit of shopping so much easier.
Some of the staff also had very good english which helped as my Balinese is not existant."
"despite being 5 minute drive away from ubud centre, the hotel gives free shuttle to and from ubud, and perhaps many other places. i just call the reception 1 hour in advanced, and when i want to go back to hotel, it usually takes 15 minute for the van to arrive. i also hear guests taking the free shuttle van to Kuta !
the included breakfast is not buffet type, which is a subject matter. you choose either continental, American or Indonesian, and they cook it for you.
In my room was a bit dark because of the dark walls. I wish hotels would all use paper/cloth lamps instead of glass or uncovered bulb.
Seems to be very low density. It was very peaceful. 
Room service was excellent. Apart from the usual room cleaning, when i go out dinner at night, and then I come back, my bed is neat again. Lovely ""gesture"" i must say."
I would strongly recommend for family travelers
"Nice people. Good place, location is very nice ..."
"It's a good property surrounded by lush green, but needs maintainance. I took two bed room villa and every where we find lot of lizards and my kids were very afraid of them. This apart the air conditioners needs maintainance as the same are having leakage and creating moisture in the room which resulted in fell down of my son.  The roof is also having leakage when it's raining. Finally it's good property but needs proper maintenance."
"The property is huge. Good pool. Very polite staff. No kettle tea/coffee provided. The property is clean but there are many lizards, so please be cautious"
Some maintenance issues
"Room is spacious enough.
Bath room open ventilation that causes lizards come in.
Brush, paste was not available in the bath room.
Mine was breakfast included but it was disappointing and not compare with any other hotels I stayed.
They have fixed menu and for even an extra milk for baby but they are not ready to give.  
As per my experience I will not suggest this hotel."
Property strictly needs some renovation. The vibe is not just correct. Staff is friendly and helpful. AC is giving trouble all the time
"The room is clean and the staffs are helpful and welcome.
Ambience of the villa is quiet, very recommended for someone who want to healing trip.  Definitely will coming back if going to ubud! :)"
ok
"Staff were helpful and friendly. I'd have prefered an enclosed bathroom instead - the glass-less window makes it a bit scary at night, we saw a frog on the wall when first stepping into the bathroom and luckily the staff who showed us around was there to help; and we had to doublelock the bathroom door all night to make sure nothing else would creep into our room while we were sleeping..."
"short term stay OK, not for long time  stay"
"Nice place, it's clean and the staff are friendly. We will back to this hotel again if we go to Ubud"
"We want to have an experiance during Nyepi in Bali, we choose Ubud and stay at Taman Harum, the staff take care us very good and we have good time either during our stay."
Setback. Room has no hot water.
"Loved it. Our room was great, right next to the pool that was nice and relaxed especially compared to the bigger resorts.
The highlight though was the eats at the restaurant at the hotel. Great food and service at a great price.
Highly recommend."
"Very beautiful facility, amazing garden, good location and lovely stuff. Swimming pool was not the cleanest I’ve seen in Bali. But deffinetely the most beautiful garden for this price range. Plus: they have dedicated co-working space with fast internet."
Need to improve in many aspects
"Loved my stay here with good facilities, tasty food and good location."
"Excellent value, wonderful staff, lovely pool area and gardens."
"Be aware of the terms for how many beds and costs for requesting another one for extra children on arrival, this was a very expensive and unexpected cost"
NO WIFI Soap and shampoo wernt filled no water given
"Could not fault a single thing. Great location, nice room, beautiful pool and really friendly and courteous staff"
"My mum and I had a great time ... staff always happy to go above and beyond 😁
Beautiful pool area massive rooms
Great air con .
Thankyou Pande and staff ☘️"
"The staff were very friendly. The breakfast was decent, facilities were good and place looked beautiful"
Good property giving a feel of cultural city Ubud.
"This place is a miniature Bali in itself! The lush green gardens, sculptures, and the constant sound of water fountains makes U feel the essence of Bali to the core. Not to mention their warm hospitality. This is a place that U aspire for to unwind!"
The hotel is not new but well maintained. It is not located in downtown but have a very accommodant free shuttle service. Food at the restaurant is delicious and service is quick! Staff was friendly and helpful
An excellent stay.  Beautiful large room.  Exceptionally clean everywhere with a lovely shower and good air con.  The pool is beautiful and a good temperature and the gardens are lush and well kept.  Breakfast included ànd a free shuttle into Ubud.     Would certainly stay again.
"The staff were friendly and courteous.  The evening driver was fantastic, notifying our restaurant of his eta and a careful driver. When my mum left her mobile in the shuttle accidentally, he searched for and returned it to our room promptly.  The spa was lovely with attentive therapists.  The restaurant food was fantastic and their delivery service throughout the resort devine.  THANK YOU!  Highly recommend this place during your Bali stay."
Very accomodating staff and rooms are clean. Will definitely book this villa when we come back
I really liked the greenery and authentic Balinese experience at the hotel. I really would recommend breakfast as a buffet because the different packages are confusing. Also would recommend a glass panel in the bathroom as many bugs including lizards enter from there.
"Lovely hotel, nice to be able to book free shuttle into Ubud and just phone to be picked up, very friendly staff."
"2 bedroom/2 bath room (open air) villa backing onto paddocks with view of mountain. 2 TVs, barfridge, safe. Lovely gardens/pool area with small children pool. Just outside Ubud in Mas. Free shuttle to and from Ubud. Convenience store across the road."
The free shuttle to and from town centre was a big help.
"Stayed for 3nights and it was great. However the location is not really strategic which is need to rent a scooter. If ure looking just to stay at the room, this is the place. To go to the town is far but they provide free shuttle to the town. Far from cafes outside. Most of the time just order the food room service. Staff r friendly. There also has a calm and peaceful environment outdoor library near the pool area."
"Per agoda, the 2-bedroom villa is with 2 rooms - 1 can be with twin beds and 1 a with double bed.
When we booked 2 units of villa, we mentioned we require both villas to be with twin beds in 1 of the room but in reality, there was only 1 villa with such configuration, all other villas are with double beds for the 2 rooms. This misrepresentation had caused extreme inconveniences and uncomfortability to our group. The floor of the villa was very sticky and we need to request the housekeeping staffs to mop the floor. Bed sheets were also dirty with stain which we have to request them to be changed"
"A diverse range of cultural activities are available on site. Good Warung at the hotel great pizzas! Supermarkets close by. The Hotel will book any attractions for you & the Masseuse; Cadek certainly releases your stress witb her skilful hands.
Cons: coffee & tea making in room would be a bonus fof us early birds."
"Friendly helpful staff
Well looked after property. Close enough to ubud with the free shuttle. 
Good breakfast. Lovely gardens. 
We used this as our central base to see the island from. 
Good value for money"
Overall a good middle-priced choice
"A few times we came to Bali, we always stay in this hotel. It's small but I got everything here. Nice staff, good facilities but believe it or not their breakfast is amazing. The juices are fresh and the meals is great.  Will definitely come back again soon"
Very friendly staff. Had a nice chat with the staff who also gave us welcome drink. Room was ok. But the aircond badly need servicing. Breakfast was nice.
"The environment of the cottages were really good, but the bed and furniture were not up to the standard. The cottages are decorated in the traditional way and would have been a great experience if they could improve the quality of the rooms."
"The place I thought was beautiful and I was quite happy that we got a room upgrade. Room was very spacious. Pool was a bit small. Breakfast had a decent selection (Continental, American and Indonesian sets) but the packed version was a little sad (bread, hard boiled egg, banana). We didn't have a choice as we needed to leave early.
Biggest downside... The bathroom had a big vent in the ceiling which allowed a lot of insects in our room if we left the door open even for just a bit. We went home with a lot of mosquito bites, especially our little one year old."
Very pleasant staff. Responsive for shuttle service to Ubud.
"Staffs were friendly and helpful.
I booked 2 bedroom and 2 bathroom. But I couldn't use 1 bathroom. Because too many bugs in there.
  The hotel wifi was not working in my room. So i had to go to lobby because of Wifi.
  Food was not bad and not expensive.
If i didn't want to get 2 bedroom, I will never choose that hotel."
"this is my second visit in this hotel.
the hotel location is not in the ubud center, but they have their own shuttle bus, therefore it very quite and clean hotel, out of city noisy, friendly staff,we spend 2 nights in this hotel, supermarket and atm nearby"
Great! The room was very clean and tidy.
"This place was perfect for our group of four couples in 4 rooms. Each room varied a bit. Some had nicer bathrooms than others, some had great A/C, other's had openings around windows which didn't allow for the A/C to work great in that room. If you've never travelled to a place like Indonesia, note they have outdoor bathrooms. The morning breakfast was delicious- i recommend trying the traditional Balinese food. All the staff were kind when we saw them around. It's not a huge place by any means but that suited our needs. Pools nice, and there is a bunch of beautiful carvings done there for purchase if you're interested. If I was returning to Ubud, I would re-book here."
"Really enjoyed our stay here. Rooms were clean and huge, the grounds were lovely and the staff very helpful. The hotel is in Mas about a 10-15 min trip by car to Ubud. The hotel has a free shuttle. So glad we stayed here and not in Ubud. Ubud is not the calm relaxed place I remember from years ago. Nice to be away from it. Good cafe for dinner. Next we travelled to Kintamani doing some sightseeing along the way. This was organised through the hotel.  We travelled with two 7 year olds and a 5 year old. If you want nightlife and cafes this is probably not the place for you."
"Beautiful garden in between rooms.
Nice and big enough rooms (two bedroom villa).
Bit dark – maybe more Java than Bali style – I strongly recommend to change those grey bed covers for something  in warmer colors as the grey stone floor is cold enough.
The terrace at the first floor was ok – but useless for most of the day as the sun was directly over it – only in the evening it was ok. 
Nice bathroom - partly open – wouldn’t hurt to put some dim (yellow) light just in between the plants – then the impression would be super.
Nice but not impressively big swimming pool – the part for kids is a bit small and for being small is to deep. 
Breakfast looks impressive on menu and less on the plate but still you won’t be hungry. 
Helpful and very nice staff."
"As hotel location is a distance from the shopping area of Ubud, it is essential to utilise the free hotel shuttlebus to get anywhere.
They were very flexible when we returned from our white water rafting and elephant ride trip late afternoon, and the shuttlebus driver took us to collect money on the way to an evening  event. We hired their bus for a tour on the way to our next destination and the driver showed us everything we asked to see.All in all excellent !!!"
"Love the wooden art gallery - the best I've seen in Bali!
Beautiful atmosphere. Helpful staff.
One thing I would change is the outdated TV and watching TV was almost impossible due to poor antenna/reception - but love the other facilities!"
It would be better if there's a glass between showroom and outside.
its a countryside village hotel with a special decoration， definitely，the room size is large and you can bathe and BBQ in your“yard”. however you have to take the shuttle bus to ubud palace as its a bit far from there
"We booked a bangalow for 2 nights. However the overall cleanliness really need to improve as spider can be found by the table lamp near the bed, dust and small stone on the mattress. We informed the staff and they managed to change to another room (next to common toilets) for us. Breakfast is limited choice but still ok. I like the environment  very much as it full of Balinese  embient. Looking forward the improvement and will come back again."
It was a lovely break from the hustle and bustle of Legian Beach.
"We stayed here for 1 night during a week end trip to Ubud. It has lovely grounds, a nice pool (with limited sun beds) and friendly staff. It's a 10 minute shuttle ride (free) into town, and nice to be out and away from the noise and pollution in Ubud. It's not always peaceful - there seemed to be a sunrise ceremony going on nearby at about 6am which woke us up, but that's all part of Bali's charm! The rooms were comfortable and fairly clean, it's not luxury, but for the price and the 3 stars, not bad at all."
Great
Absolutely wonderful it was our fifth stay there
satisfactory
"Wonderful, relaxing, serene, too short. perfect getaway from hustle of the city."
"It's located in Ubud. If u r looking for quiet, laid back, read a book by the pool, private hideout then this is the place. Not for those seeking nightlife and happening scenes. Need to have transport to move about."
Had a great stay here with clean and large rooms. Staff were very helpful and although the hotel is a little out of Ubud they offer a free shuttle bus service.
"The decoration of this hotel is full of Balinese culture. But we have to be careful when booking, because the option of occupants in this hotel is so strict, we have to pay more for additional person there."
"The location of hotel is quite far away from the Ubud town area, but hotel provide shuttle bus service. Other than that, the room is a bit old and not well maintained especially the toilet. Yellow lights make the room very deem and a little bit creepy. Breakfast served was good."
The staff is very sweet and caring. They prepared surprise for my birthday. (including birthday cake and the birthday song from all the staff). It is nice.
"Since the room has some open-area, some insects may come into the room."
We have had a nice rest and enjoyed the surrounding.
"it is fully balinese architecture design, quiet environment, and nice garden design"
"I am very satisfied with everything at the hotel.Good food,helpful staff,good location,nice interior decoration in the room."
"Our only regret was not staying here longer. We had the Suite which was amazing, highly recommended for honeymooners. Beautiful view. Large room with 4 poster bed. Spacious open aired bathroom with tub. You get your own living area with a kitchenette. Direct access to the swimming pool. The hotel compound was just beautiful, you truly are surrounded by nature. Tours can be arranged by hotel staff at the lobby. The hotel is quite far from central Ubud but shuttel service is available upon request."
It was superb. With green environment preferable showing the nature of garden.
"At first im worried about my stay during first night! My room air-con isn't working well& have stains + dust on bed & floor the  open concept bathroom is not my type. Until we make an complained, room changed tonvlosed concept one it is ok. The American Breakfast was ok but the dinning area is full of flies.  Overall # cleanliness need to be improve."
"I had a wonderful  stay in Taman Harumn. It is quiet and serene , great for relaxing . The staff were friendly and helpful , always accommodating . Although the location is at the outskirts of ubud central , there was no problem arranging the shuttle service with the hotel. There is one mini super market opposite the hotel . The food in the hotel is not too bad. I had the nasi campur and nasi goreng and find it quite tasty ."
"A beautiful truly Balinese Hotel with staff who have all been there for years.Any problems happily sorted out straight away. Great pool. Only downside was it was in the middle of nowhere and while they had a free shuttle into Ubud you couldn't just pop out for a walk. Kitchen had nothing in it except 2 glasses and 2 bottles of water, I had to ask for a kettle and some mugs and a spoon so we could make a drink without going into the restaurant.Fabulous place to relax and they even put flowers in the room for my birthday."
"Really enjoyed, it was relaxing and romantic. Staff was friendly, attentive and spoke English. Always did they try to find away to help out and think with us on things we would like to do. Food in the hotel restaurant was good. And we liked our cooking lessons very much."
"you have to keep in mind that it is a 3* hotel. Tht means that some amenities you might know from high class hotel are missing. The gardens are very nice, breakfast was sufficient (a la carte) and a shuttle was offered to Ubud (about 20 Mins). They have open bathrooms. That bothered me a bit as there are always insects comming in."
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Only thing lacking was a hand towel and towelling bathmat in bathroom.  Would recommend that these be provided.  Apart from that we were very comfortable and well looked after.
"We had a villa, which the staff then said was honeymoon villa.
It was lovely but a bit small with 2 kids in the room and despite the room having a big footprint the actual bedroom was small.
Outdoor bathroom with a huge bath, big shower
Seating area, also outdorrs with a TV and kitchen area as well. Another outdoor seating area with a glass wall looking over the fields behind
Great pool for the kids and restaurant food was Ok for lite bites and quick food for kids.
best addition was the courtesy car into Ubud until 10 pm, super touch.
Found a puppet museum close by and of course loads of stuff in area for carving, glass work, we did Bird park that kids loved. We had our own hire car which I recommend if you are travelling around Bali.
Small shop across road for nibbles and beer.
A few maintenance details need to be sorted out, light bulbs that do not work, electric sockets broken, blocked shower rose and internet was pretty poor.
But yes it was worth it"
