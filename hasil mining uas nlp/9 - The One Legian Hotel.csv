"Friendly staff, great location within walking  distance to the kuta mall and beach, plenty of restaurants within walking distance, cleanliness is tiptop and we got the room that’s just one foot away from the rooftop bar swimming pool and it was great! Got complimentary welcome drink at the hotel restaurant and ended up having lunch there. Surprisingly amazing food and drinks with very affordable price. Highly recommended … There are ATMs at the ground floor of the hotel too as well as basement car park …"
"Great hotel. Staff are friendly. Great location
Starbucks are on the ground floor, great quality coffee. Able to order grab food as hotel is quite recognised.
Improvements
1.Check in could hve been earlier if possible. Pls review it. 
2. Slightly run down but it was ok for me.
3. Good breakfast but chicken was slightly dry, could have done alot better."
"The location is great, you can walk to the beach within 15mins or less. You can easily find restaurants or bars nearby. the staff is so kind as well. They clean the room so well and clean!"
"ONE Legian Hotel
Best hotel with 4* facilities.
It is big and clean room, party location with very very  nice two pools. 
Have restaurant, live band and Starbucks at first floor,  and big parking. 
Just wifi is ok"
"Strategic location. You should try this hotel. Although the space quite small but the cleanliness are best. Value for your money. I recommend this hotel, absolutely"

Good place to stay around Legian Street. 900 m walking to Beachwalk Mall and Kuta Beach. So many restos and cafes around the hotel. The room is clean and i got a room with good view. Thanks!
Decent hotel at Legian. It's located in the middle of Legian and close to the beach and bar. Love my time when I was there.
Good breakfast good location nice pool. Staff were very good and helpful. 5 star review!
"was located about 20min walk away from the beach, and there are a lot of shops around the area. the room was relatively clean other than the 1 lizard in the room, and the bed was very comfortable. highly recommended"
The hotel is very centrally located to all areas. A great location to commence tours. The facilities are great and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  The way we were treated was above and beyond.
"So, all and all this place is as good as it gets for your value. I have tried time and time again to find another location but would end up paying 1.5 to 2.0 times the price as I am here. 3 pools here with a nice quiet long pool in a courtyard setting and a roof top pool. Breakfast is great all the time. Lots of variety along with local Indo food as well. All the staff have been exceptional! Helpful, courteous and friendly. Now, the only thing, with the great location comes the night time music so take this into consideration if it is a concern to you. Also, I have travelled Asia for 6.5 months now and the outside merchants/taxi drivers/ massage ladies are absolutely full on!!!!! They do not go away so keep this in mind when coming to Bali in general. Hotel is fantastic. We will stay a few more nights before going back home."
"Good hotel in legian area, has starbuck in lobby, many restaurants surrounding it, nice staff surprising me with birthday cake in the morning, nice breakfast.  👍👍"
"Very satisfied because the service from the staff is very friendly, the cleanliness of the room is good enough  for me and my friend the size of the room is quite large and most importantly they have hot water for bathing at any time. I stayed 2 nights and intend to extend it another day. The minus is that there are only mosquitoes in the room when you enter but overall everything is okay. I will choose this hotel again 👍"
"Upon arrival, we got a free upgrade to a deluxe room and it really made my partner happy especially when checking out we got 1 Starbucks voucher.
Unfortunately we only had one night because we had to continue our journey...
For over all very special service.
thank you..."
The rooms were super clean. Staff were friendly. The buffet breakfast was great. Close to everything.
The hotel was one of the best places I've stayed in bali it's clean modern many facilities eg pools bars restaurant great place to stay with your loved ones
This was the second time I stayed at the one. I found the beds hard to sleep on this time round tho ;( it was upsetting as my body was all sore
The staff are very nice. Very relaxing place. The food is very tasty and served hot. Everything is great!
"Breakfast and amenities were are quite good. Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly and helpful. Very good value considering all the above. The only thing is once you leave the hotel premises you get mauled by all the outside merchant scammers, massage uglies, and taxi/transportation scabs!!!! Travellers be extremely careful in this area!!!!!!"
"Great location, friendly staff. Food is delicious although there could be more variety. We were very happy with our stay. Air conditioning in rooms was very good. Pool was clean and lovely"
"Well, I think this is the best hotel along Legian Road in term of  affordable price, great location, just few steps from crowd of fun if you know what I mean ;)
Great facilities coming with 2 (or 3?) Swimming pools (roof-top pool you just can't miss it!). 
Delicious breakfast, my wife was so satisfied with variety of the foods!
100% guaranteed will re-book here once we come to Bali in the future!"
"Great location and price with nice buffet breakfast. We loved the interconnecting rooms for our 9 and 10 yr old girls, the extra bathroom was great. Nice clean rooms and pools with very helpful staff.  Security a bonus as well highly recommended."
Yeah so another good review. Hotel is all around very good. Staff are great. Breakfast is always a delight! Music at night but it is Bali! This hotel is right on the strip! We thought about mixing it up a little and moving to another hotel in a different area but would be looking at around double or even more to match what this hotel has to offer. The One is tough to beat unless you’re shooting for the stars!!!
"I travelled with my senior citizen mom, the staff ensured all the facilities can be availed by her easily they even helped to pick up the luggage from outside of their building.."
"Central located hotel, having good lobby to relax and have meeting with friends and business. More convenient for transportation to different places like beaches nearby. Good break fast and sky pool and spa to relax. Staff also good and more friendly."
Went to One Legian for my honeymoon. The staff decorated the room for 2 days. Professional staff. Absolute clean room. Good pool view. There is a bar with hip hop at 1st level
"Location strategic, clean and worth it
This is my 2nd time stay here"
"Even though, all over the world big issue because of healthy problems, lockdown many country , city hotel , the one Legian hotel service very nice , kind manners of staff skillful attitudes for the customers 
Now I’m stay more days with only two guest in this hotel 
Hotel reception manager and all staff high technology good service 
Thank you very much"
Best spot for couple whose want to enjoy the daily atmospheric of kuta bali. Annd..we've got free upgrade for 3 nites. Really recommended.
"The One Legian is our favorite hotel every time we go to Bali, best location and best price ....."
"The place location and staff are amazing, only fault was the breakfast menu, we stayed for 11 nights and the breakfast was the same it never change the fruits they gave is the same for 11 days to think that it’s a tropical country they could have change it to different fruits..."
"Price wasn't bad. 
Pool was great and room condition was quite nice for me.
But shower tap didn't work well. 
Staff was super kind !!"
"Considering the location and the price, it’s quite good. It’s difficult to nickpick that the hotel feels a little aged considering the price. The staff is professional as well."
"All staff are friendly, near to the beach, local  shops, the location awesome  !!!"
"Good location and value for money. The first night we stayed was noisy due to poor room soundproofing, manage to changed to a better room after complained.  The breakfast food choices need to be improved. 
Overall good stays and will come back again."
"The staff were wonderful,food was great the room basic but clean. Music at  night was sometimes too loud and we could here the base thumping till very late. Other than that we loved it and are happy to recommend  it to travellers."
Best location. Will stay again later.
"The location was great, but the room was too small."
"Price was very cheap but what you get is so affordable. Very clean, location was perfect. If you wanna come to Bali specially in legian, you better stay in here."
"We had a great stay here. It was central, clean and the breakfast buffet was amazing. However, loud party music went on way into the night and was crystal clear in our room which is something we were not expecting."
All and all the best hotel in the area. Taking facilities and breakfast into consideration along with very affordable price.
Moved here after staying at another hotel and were very happy with our visit
IT WAS ALL MAGNIFICENT. THE WHOLE IDEA OF BEING AROUND BALINESE PEOPLE IS MAGICAL
My only complain is the mini fridge is not working. I need to buy cold drinks nearby convenience store. Otherwise my stay is worth coming back.
For ppl who look easy access to the bars
"Friendly staff, great location and very clean"
"Gd food
Convenience
Clean"
Would recommend staying here but not near the staff entrance and exit.
"strategic location .. nice to walk along the street. we had a nice 20 mins walk from legian to Hard Rock cafe bali
room was clean and fairly spacious. nice pool but we didn’t get to use it. used the spa service, good service    and staff was professional"
A bit noisy when the have functions but the staff are amazingly helpful and friendly
The staff very nice and clean
So far facility and staff good... Only breakfast not variatif.
All facilities good
"located in central road, comfy bed and spacious room, but uncomfortable lobby area. you have to go up by stairs and escalator to go to lobby. But the staff are really helpful."
Great Location and surrounding
Staf very helpful.. ada sedikit masalah tp staf sgt membantu.. luar biasa
Toilets are small
The staff went beyond our expectations
Clean basic hoyel in good location with everything close by. Very loud music at the pool ( like as loud as a nightclub) so don't expect to relax with a cocktail. Good schoolies vibe.
"Great pool
Lovely staff
Great location
Lovely interior and look about it - attracted me to it in the first place
Only downside was the smell in the bathroom."
Good place
Mantap tawwa
"It was an emergency booking, but it turned out great. It locates in the center of everything, restaurants, drinks, bar... Nice staff, nice building, but rooms are quite out of date and small. Room is good to stay one night but nice amenities."
Be Nice person
"Prime location, around 10-15 min walking to beach or you can use grab. Near many authentice Bali resto. Cheap for 4 star hotel, but the room is small. The table also very small, and lack of electric socket. We booked deluxe pool acces room and got 3rd floor room in front of skypool, the room is quite noisy when there is many people swiming. Also when raining, you will be wet when you are walking to the room from lift. I would recommend this hotel only for solo or couples, not for family with children"
"The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly. I did not enjoy staying in this hotel purely because it as very noisy. It was not relaxing, like a holiday should be. I will definitely not return."
"If you're a tourist then this place is near a lot of places, so easy to get around"
"I was there for 1 night 
All staff friendly and helpful 
Lobby is good for relaxing and working 
Room was ok but our room at ground floor we are not comfortable with bed which is  i came with my husband we get large bed but make it from twin bed joint together,if we want sleep in the middle its not comfortable because like there is gap between twin bed ,we need to sleep with our own bed.
We went to Deck Restaurant food was good staff was friendly but staff busy talking to friends doesn’t care about guests beside."
Been here nine days had a few private parties on the sun deck pool. Down the centre of the building is open and the music and PA can not be blocked out of the rooms. If your looking for somewhere quiet to retreat to after partying One Legian may not be for you
"This is a great hotel. I stayed here Two times already, once in 2018 and once  in 2019. The location is great on the main street of legian, close to restaurants, Clubs and shops. It has a starbucks coffee shop withing the same building ( entrance ). True the rooms are not that big but they are cozy and comfortable and well cleaned. 
The only thing i hate it was that the pool is not 24 hours, as it is one of my favorite things to do upon returning late nights."
"Have stayed at The ONE a few times now. It’s always been good value for the location and style of rooms. 
Staff are always very nice and Check in is simple and efficient.
Have to say Breakfast has taken a dive compared to pre Covid days. Selection is poor, especially for Western Tastes. 
Plus the Sky Pool area needs some Maintenance- the floor boards need replacing badly. 
However love to rent the rooms by the Sky Pool. Area."
"Cleanliness of hotel was 100%. Staff were very friendly. The room we had was very very small and had no wardrobe to put your clothes, however the receptionist did show us 2 other options to upgrade too and was very helpful. The area is more suited to the younger people. Breakfast was average."
One of the strategic hotel if you want some Legian-Kuta experienced
Good breakfast
"Prime location, around 10-15 min walking to beach or you can use grab. Near many authentice Bali resto. Cheap for 4 star hotel, but the room is small. The table also very small, and lack of electric socket. I would recommend this hotel only for solo or couples, not for family with children"

"Beds were a bit hard but everything else was good. Accommodation was safe and clean, staff were friendly and amenities were good. For the price it was great value. Would probably stay near Seminyak next time to see more of that side of town."
"Good for stay, location strategis"
Decent location - great breakfast
We must come next time
We must come next time
"I stay here with my wife for 3 days and 2 nights, it's comfy with friendly staff. Unfortunately, the gym facilities are not completely ready. Some of them are under maintenance. Overall, it's nice hotel, good  location"
"not much choices for breakfast . However room was clean and spacious , staff was friendly and excellent service . Great location with lots of shops , restaurants and Spa"
"Hotel bersih & nyaman, tetapi bukan yang terbaik dengan price range yang diberikan:"
"Now Bali is recovering we were hoping the hotel would go back to the way it was before, but we were quite dissapointed in the small things that made it so good not reapearing. Shortage of towels, very poor TV chanel choice coupled with very poor internet and the included breakfast no longer has a good 'european/american' selection. We will now look for an alternative to what was an exceptional hotel."
located in main central street and easy to access
"The location is good for those who just like to walk to shops/eateries and night entertainment outlets.
It may a a bit noisy if you are a light sleeper.
Else, the room is functional and sufficient for our consumption.
If you are adventurous enough, you could walk to Kuta beach area which is about 2 km away; while walking, you can browse shops along the road that has clothes, accessories and eateries to offer.
By and large, a reasonably good hotel to stay."
"everything was good, the location and food also nice! thanks!"
"Great Value accomodation, only improvements could be Breakfast and the floor boards around the pool are dangerous."
Be good people
"Good location, but no smoking in room"
"Stayed here during my annual birthday trip and had a good enough experience. The room was clean and comfortable, pool area was nice to hangout in. Location is also really good, close to the beach, good restaurants, and shops. I also appreciated the complimentary drinks. Overall, had a really comfortable stay in this hotel!"
Location is great
"Great place, with a good buffet breakfast on top level. Pools downstairs and on the top level. The top level bar was closed when I stayed, not enough tourists back yet I guess.
The only slightly annoying thing - the rooms have small signs saying to save water leave your towel hanging so it doesn't get washed..I did that repeatedly but every time I got a new towel..! Other than that, would stay again if I got a reduced/sale price, but don't think I'd pay the 'standard' price for these rooms."
"Good location, helpful staff but misunderstood while checkin so we don't get the room we prefer. Breakfast is not too bad but so crowded  and not much choices."
Located in Legian street full of night clubs/bars and small vendors selling local stuffs. The hardworking vendors open their shops at 8 am and close at 10 p.m. every day. Getting halal food such as nasi padang is also a plus point for us muslim travelers. Get your coffee fix in the morning at the Starbucks just one floor down from the lobby. Dont worry about your safety  as the security is also very tight here they will check your bags and your vehicles before entering the lobby.
Good hotel. Value for money. Services are very good.
"Very slow check inn 
Good value, breakfast was average some dishes seemed to be not hot enough.
Room clean and tidy 
Pool area was nice"
"The room was clean, decent size but furniture was a bit dated 
The bathroom was ok the small size and the shower holes wasn’t appropriate for tall people 
Despídete the fact of not being able to open the windows due to the fact of the mosquitos ( the room was quite damp) 
The facilities were ok 
The lobby was beautiful , lots of lounges with openable windows elevated above the street.
The two pools are really nice but after 5 pm only rap music was playing ( which is not our taste) 
The staff were very friendly and it was people cleaning all the time 
Breakfast was very poor ( if ur looking for European breakfast you might as well go elsewhere )
The gym was very small and some of the equipment wasn’t working and no free weights 
Overall it’s a lovely place in the need of a little modernisation"
"Great location. Right in the center. Nice pool at the terrace.  Only downside, very small room."
"Great location, tasty breakfast, good staff"
Location here is good. Breakfast can do with some improvement. Same dishes everyday but choices are very minimal. Lack some key dishes for breakfast.
Renovations taking place next door ROOM with a HAMMER.Had to move hotels
Uda nggu d'loby dri jam 10an tggu cek in jam 1 bru dpt kamar jam 3 - 4 lwt
good facilities with great location
"If you don’t care about cleanliness and much and facilities then it’s good place for you. For me never will because I found blood stain on the bed, and smelly towels, and I believe it’s not 4 stars hotel."
"It is not as nice as it looks. The rooms are fine, just fine. The overall design, furniture is a little dated. Breakfast is fine but not worthy 4-star hotel.
The gym/fitness is a disaster: very old, no maintenance whatsoever and half broken.
Good location and service also not bad."
Simple breakfast provides. My room the door suddenly no battery can't open the door
"Room is ok, slightly small but acceptable. Cleanliness not sparkling clean but acceptable.
The walls are thin, every sound can be heard clearly. But after midnight everything cool down and become quiet,  so still ok.
Hotel environment ok, breakfast was good, pool is nice, hotel staff so far so good.
Distance to the beach is far. But in the Main Street of legian."
"attention to pickpockets. I got stoled my iPhone just in front of the hotel on the first night and nobody did nothing. after that, they tried to take my apple watch from my hand. a very dangerous area. I don't recommend. go directly to Ubud or other areas."
Def good location but the rooms can get a bit noisy at night with people banging the doors or talking loudly. The hotel should enforce a no noise policy after 1am. This really affected my sleep other than that I have no complain
Had things removed from our room from cleaners.. wasn't happy.. Other then that was a good Hotel.
"Walking distance to many restaurant , shop, circle K and cafe. Bathroom bit small and room was ok."
"Booked this hotel for 3 nights after reading mixed reviews, was stoked with the location more than anything but was so so disappointed, I could only handle one night & had to check out & go to another hotel... didn't find out until I'd checked in that there was maintenance going on all day, hotel was severely run down & looked dishevelled. You could literally hear a pin drop in the next room, and the upstairs neighbours constantly walking around and moving about their room, it's not OK noise wise. Will never stay here again, and not recommend it to anyone, couldn't even get my money back regardless of the noise issues being their own fault. Asked to be moved to a better room but that wad also a no. Don't do it."
"Good. (1) Helpful check-in staff, (2) parking for car, (3) nice place for BF (friendly staff) with varieties of food (4) lots of restaurants, massage nearby (5) Rooms are OK in general (6) Pools are nice
Not so good. (1) Towels, bedsheets, pillow sheets are dirty (worn out, stained). High time to replace (2) Noisy at night (music from nearby clubs). I had to call the reception once when some guests made so noises outside my room and playing loud music. (3) Very slow check in/check out. Check in supervisor looked so serious, no smiles"
"Value for money with pool on roof and coffee shop on ground floor, if you need a place to stay whilst on a stop over or for 1-2 nights, you could do a lot worse."
"If you're early or feeling unwell, it is not the concern of the hotel.  Check in is strictly 3 p.m. They are the rules.  There might be many or nearly all of their almost 400 hundred available rooms cleaned, prepared and vacant but the rules are inconsiderate of the circumstances of the guest.  Most of the staff are wonderful but for the junior supervisors, customer service is secondary to upholding ""rules"".   The standard reply at 2.55  is ""Your room is not prepared Sir"".  Then suddenly at 3.00pm yours and every other available room is suddenly ready, prepared and automatically available.  If the guest is there 1 or 3 or more hours early and the room is prepared and available, staff should show customer service principles and allow the guest to access their booked room.  It hurts no-one.  The hotel loses nothing."
"1. very slow check-in
2. booking the room with breakfast but keep on say don't include even I have show them my booking details. 
3. request for daily complimentary bottle water saying that will send to my room but at the end no send also."
