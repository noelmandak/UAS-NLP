"A beautiful Balinese hotel with excellent staff and a great pool with swim up bar. The room has air conditioning, clean bathroom and nice bedroom to sleep well. Any issues the staff attend to it immediately. Close walk to shops and convenient hotel transportation through the hotel. Safe and secure for a solo traveler. Food and drinks were great and affordable. Price is affordable for those who want a simple hotel to sleep and relax in while on holiday in Bali. Lots of Australian tourists stay here, so making friends is easy."
"I really enjoyed staying here.  Good price, clean, comfortable, friendly, ease of access and within walking distance to restaurants, bars, beach, banking and shopping.  I would definitely stay here again."
"Loved it here, it was in the heart of the action! The bungalows were clean & spacious! The pool areas was great, it had a swim up bar which I loved! I would stay here again without a doubt!!!"

"We loved it here, it’s clean, the pools lovely with a swim up bar, all staff were lovely! It was great value for money, we ended up extending as we loved it so much, we’d definitely stay here again!!"
It was great! The staff was very accommodating and the food is really good. They provide great service and the location itself is amazing since it’s in the center of everything! We love the pool and the pool side bar! ❤️ will recommend to everyone! Will come back next year!
All things considered we visited when the world first opened up after covid so the hotel was still in getting back to normal mode. Great location freindly staff and service
"The rooms are a little older and could use updating, but they come every day to keep them as clean as they can. All the staff are fantastic here and the restaurant food is five star."
"Legian Paradiso is a great hotel for the money. Super friendly staff, fantastic pool with swim up bar and even a small gym. Breakfast included and great vibrant location."
all i have to say come and stay at the legian paradiso its not upper class or flashy the people that work here is what makes this place so special
"We had a pleasant stay at the Paradiso hotel. price is very good, everything is clean and the staff is helping and friendly! We would surely come back!"
Great hotel for the price have  stayed here a few over the years will keep coming back great location good clean rooms great pool
Very accommodating and very close to multiple beaches. loved my stay here.
"Just stayed 2 weeks at legian Paradiso,  rooms were nice,  air-conditioning was perfect,  we had a pool view room with a nice balcony,  rooms cleaned daily with fresh towels by the number one cleaner Agung , breakfast was perfect!  Also had dinner at the restaurant a couple times the Indian dishes are outstanding,  we used the fitness center daily which is set up very well,  could not fault this place,  we will be back,  cheers Jayson and Nicky."
located on downtown with lots of foods & clubs nearby. lots of tourists roam around the roads freely. highly recommend. 15 mins from airport.
"Definitely worth the price, 2nd time staying. Great people around the hotel too, made friends with them and created a memory of a lifetime."
"Huge rooms that are quiet, tidy clean great staff n facilities"
The building is old but I love their hospitality and the location is perfect
"Loved the facilities, rooms, staff and the pool!

"Friendly staff, and great food  after my one night here I was actually thinking of moving out but once I told them my concerns, my Wi-Fi was working good but a little slow and the air-conditioning is working fine"
Second time staying here staff are fantastic rooms nice and clean location is great breakfast left a lot to be desired not much choice food from restaurant was fantastic will definitely stay again but won't have breakfast
Was lovely hotel pool was great staff great food great location great
Please don't just cancel booking by tourist as we not always have telephone line or wifi during travel for first arrival.
"We stayed couple of nights here, just for rest and go. Worked well for us. Place has taken toll during Covid, a retouch could make it brighter again."
"Always enjoy my stay here. !! Staff, Cleanliness, Location 5 star !!"
Nice pool and close to everything that you need on your holiday. Felt safe in the hotel as I was travelling alone. Excellent staff and customer service.
amazing been going there for 7 years
I would recommend it families with children  for young couples
It is so spacious and open garden area and pool were superb.
"Good for solo travellers as the pool area is a social meeting place. 
She is an old girl with need of some repairs but staff were working on rooms all the time I was there. It was clean and the facilities were ample. Not fancy but very good value for money"
"Old hotel but comfy with nice staffs,and also for me great location"
"A lovely old school Bali hotel. 
Friendly staff.
Close to everything but far enough away."
"Would stay again. Very nice place for the price, pool was great, staff was excellent. No complaints at all."
"The room is clean, hotel facilities are good and the staffs are very friendly."
"Some of the hotel is a little dated but it is still tidy. What it lacks in this area it makes up for with very friendly staff, great room service, hot water that is actually hot, and a strategic location. Great for the price and would consider staying again."
"savaged during covid lockdown but really trying hard now, in a couple of months should be ticking over nicely...."
The staff make you feel very welcome and the rooms are good. The good is excellent..would recommend to stay here as i come here often
"Great value for money ,and very quiet despite being on a very busy street.  Tons of great restaurants nearby. Rooms are pretty dated but comfortable and great value.  Rooms are cleaned daily which is pretty amazing for the price point."
"Fantastic location right in the thick of it.. short walk to the beach, hotel set back off street so street noise was not a problem.. Great value for money - your standard Bali accommodation"
"Staff were amazing, food was great. The room was dated (superior deluxe pool room), however I didn’t spend much time in there. There were some issues with the pool, which were sorted out the day before I left. Low staff numbers due to low booking numbers, but this didn’t hinder my stay. I would stay there again. The location was perfect for me."
"Very clean and beautiful hotel and quiet at night. 
Comfortable accommodation"
The swimming pool is great! Location is quite far to the clubs (by walking) but still nice to stay! :)
Nice place with friendly staff.
But I got lucky as I booked as covid rules were easing. It’s now gone up in price but quiet and in a good location with a nice pool
"Easy walking distance to many bars and restaurants, about 10-12 min walk to the beach, super friendly staff.
I will book here again in 2023."
Excellent staff and I liked the Balinese style of this dated hotel.
Staffs are very friendly. Reasonable price with good location and service. Satisfied and wanna recommend to others.
"Ok I’ll give yar a full frank honest account 
I’ll give u the positive first.
It’s $35 bucks ozzie a night for a clean bed with breakfast .
The pool is clean.
This place needs a lot of maintenance everywhere.
U’ll be honest if I had young kids I’m sorry I’d say no, but for adults with older kids or just adults who want a cheap room with breakfast it’s really good.
Don’t expect all lush stuff it’s not here … see the rate again it’s cheap.. they closed for over two years, if u stay there they will get it all back up to standard, there’s always something little going on for improvement.
Help um out.!! If ur on a tight budget it’s good"
The hotel location is a great selling point of the place. Its layout also gives a privacy for its guest despite being in front of a busy street life. The pool is also very enclosed far from the public’ view.
Great stay breakfast was value for money Western and Indonesian you would not go hungry eggs cooked to your liking you just had to ask what your preference was very quick to bring it to your table we are going back in May2023 already booked only negative was the ratbag kids around the pool trashing stuff and parents didn't control them and ashtrays left on seats with butts in them all in all great value for money
Near to Kuta
Great location. Beautiful staff.
"Hotel in the middle of Legian.  Accessible to Kuta and Kuta beach.  Well priced and a good variety of food and drinks available. Nice friendly staff.
Good for families with a small children's pool attached to the main pool area"
"Near Kuta Beach., a lots of cafe and resto"
We are glad to be able to come back and see familiar faces. Pool was disappointing being full of kids toys but overall pleasant stay.
"Nice place to stay.  We loved lounging in the pool with the noodles. 
Nice balcony.  
Considering that it was in a busy area, it was surprisingly quiet, even while in the pool in the evenings."
"nice location, nice place to stay"
"We have  stayed  pre covid  ,and now  after  covid  ,hotel  is trying  its best  ,no complaints  from us ,we are going  again  next  month"
A bit old but cheapo
"located at Jalan Legian street, and not far to Kuta beach"
Great location
Perfectly clean and lovely place. Ranges from $30aus a night. Cleaned everyday bed made towels replaced. Was more than expected. Staff were as always in Bali just the great. Going back in few days to stay again for last part of trip.
"Very friendly staff, good central location close to bars and restaurants, maybe 10 minutes walk to beach. Very good breakfast buffet selection. Clean, fair sized room and hot water on tap. Fair value with Agoda deal and would stay here again, no problem."
Excellent  staff friendly and fantastic..
"i would recommend. this hotel to families, couples and singles  i  can't fault it atmosphere cleanliness price and most important customer service always served and greeted with a big smile 🙂"
Great value for money. The bed was excellent as was the AC and pool.
"All good, quite old world. Only problem was the ""music""noise from the pool all afternoon, euphemistically called ""pool party"" by reception, which made sitting outside the room during the afternoon impossible. The noise stopped at 6 thankfully, but personally I just don't get it."
"Good value hotel, the staff are friendly and helpful. The location is central. It has a poolside bar and meals are available.  The restaurant and bar at the front faces the street, it is comfortable and allows easy and obvious access to meet friends. The air conditioned room was large and comfortable."
This hotel is great value for money
"Excellent value for money, aircon worked, bed comfortable,  pool clean with bar, safe didn't work, lock box at reception in the heart of legian. For 13 dollars a night don't expect the Ritz. On a budget stay here."
"My 14 year old daughter and I stayed at Legian Paradisio Hotel for a total of 11 nights and we very much enjoyed our stay. The room was tidy, the staff were friendly and the location was central, which I found great. I would definitely stay here again! My only drawback is that the hotel is located right between many market stalls (like many in the Legian/Kuta areas) therefore, each time we left, regardless of whether we went left or right, the hassling of market shop owners was intense even if we had no intention of shopping. However, this is not a reflection of the hotel or their staff in itself, just the location, which on the other hand, is very central to food, shopping, spa’s and is directly across the road from a Circle K, which was very convenient for a quick dash to grab water, snacks or other small supplies. It is also only a short walk from the memorial and nightclubs, so would be a fantastic option for travellers looking to experience the Kuta nightlife while in Bali :)"
"Very glad we picked this hotel because the pool was clean and resort-like and the room while not modern was clean and adequate. Buffet breakfast is ok if included with the room but if paying, there are better options outside. Will come back."
Lumayan bagus dan lokasi OK.. Harga the BEST
"You get what you pay for, location is fantastic, staff are friendly and helpful. I would stay again"
"great location, pool rooms look nicer then superior, we stayed in a superior room mouldy smell not cleaned very well, hard to get pool towels everyday got told they were at the laundry. Would stay again but in a pool view room."
"Smack bang in the centre of Legian, value for money if you are just looking for somewhere to sleep. I have stayed here before covid, i think at the moment they are generally just getting back on their feet."
Really enjoyed our stay. Clean and comfortable
"Loved our stay .. will be back 
Great location .. loverly staff 
Had everything we needed"
Close to everything and within your budget! Will comeback anyway!
Clean and tidy .. great pool and amazing staff
"Initially was going to use the room for a pre flight room to have a shower before a late night flight. Circumstances changed and had to stay the night. It was basic but clean, bathroom shower was good. A little night noise as people came back fro been out but that had nothing to do with hotel. 
Overall for $20 you couldn’t ask for more."
"Good price for typical Bali Rooms. Comfortable and Clean. Pool Rooms seemed a bit more modern. 
Really close to the centre of Legian on theain road but is set well back you wouldn't even know.
Pool area is great with swim up bar and nice and Deep at one end so always a Cool Swim. Staff where lovely and accommodated any request needed.
Kettle, small bar fridge, bottle of water and general ""bits"" supplied each day.
I'd stay there again"
"Big balconies, swim up bar, close to everything."
"Five night stay. Met all my needs  
Fantastic location"
"Very friendly staff. Great buffet breakfast selection.
Nice gardens and pool. Fair sized rooms, hot water and central location to bars/restaurants."
"I had previously stayed at this hotel about 8months before the beginning of Covid in 2019 and it was fantastic, which is why I chose to stay here again. Unfortunately Covid has done a number on this poor hotel- garden over grown; pool falling apart; rooms run down & in serious need of repairs & a paint to cracks & holes in walls; gym nearly non-functioning as all equipment was broken except for a tread mill & bike; toilets in gym had not been cleaned in a long time as it looked like someone had an explosion in one of them and it set like concrete; sheets & towels a shade of grey/brown- not bright white and had a bit of a smell to them; no water offered in the room anymore; buffet breakfast very average & limited options; & restaurant menu while extensive, only had limited options available- it was quicker to ask what they offered rather than ask what items they didn't have. Staff are very friendly tho and always willing to help & say hello. If I had paid alot of money to stay here I would have asked for a refund, but I didn't so accept that Covid was very hard on Bali, & forgive the lack of maintenance & care. Room for improvement for sure, so I'd love to see it built up to what it used to be."
Good service
"The room is spacious, with a balcony facing the pool and a bathtub but the room is not very clean, a few insects found under the bathroom sink and inside the fridge"
"I would say the price is freaking cheap but I'm a bit disappointed with the linen because it looks quite dirty.
I only booked for a night because my flight was late evening.
My bf couldn't wait to check out.
Linen quality can be improved but location is quite good."
"Location is great, one block from the ocean, good shopping area, easy walk everywhere. Staff are friendly and helpful.
The rooms are older but good size room for one or 2 days. Good budget hotel."
"This hotel is worth what you pay. We had an old room, was on $24 a night. We just wanted a late night flight room. For $24 you couldn’t ask for more . We stayed at one that was $80 a night the next night and Legian Paradiso was better than the $80 a night hotel ."
Great hotel in a great location. Rooms are huge but need an upgrade
great location and we had fun staying in this hotel.
"Pool is nice, and rooms are spacious. Towels weren't available for the first day of our stay, and the AC leaks a lake into the room. That said, the place is nice, the location is good, and the staff are kind."
"Got in late thanks to a late flight which meant i could no longer be picked up by the hotel. When I got there my sheets were covered in stains including what looked like blood and my pillow cases were brown from stains, the bed was to different height singles pushed together to make a king. No towels, air con did not work, fridge did not work and was mouldy, shower bath was split and felt like I was going to fall through and the balcony wood was so rotten that if you touched it it just crumbled away. Needless to say I didn't stay for the rest if my booking."
Low budget hotel and getting old some minor issues such as toilet malfunction noisy aircon any complaints were delt with promptly staff were very obliging
"Great location within walking distance to shopping, cafes & bars. Approximately 1km walk to beach. Rooms basic and clean. Good size pool with swim-up bar."
"Great value for money. Super deluxe pool room was the best as no shower over the bath.
Best location, great coffee and breakfast across the road."
"The best feature is the walkable location.
Otherwise, nothing outstanding. As mentioned in other reviews, it's a bit dated, but nothing really wrong with it.
Pool is attractive, but water slightly manky.
Rooms spacious, and well appointed enough, but won't be confused with luxury.
Breakfast buffet below average, but the in house restaurant is good.
Right on target for the budget."
"Pros, huge room 6mx4m, huge bathroom. Nice gardens , good size pool with swim up bar, quite location.
Cons. Very firm pillows, not enough pool towels, needs more umbrellas for shade around pool."
The pool area is fun. But could do with more shade. All in all we had a good stay and would come back
"Friendly staff, big room, location is good. 
I would  come back."
"1) Good location near to many cafes restaurants and Spas.  The famous ""YES""  SPA is just 5 mins walk from the hotel. 
2) Staffs at reception were friendly.  
3) My room were facing the reception areas are outdated and the towels were so worn out!  I ask to have the towels change by tipping the housekeeper.  The cupboards smells and definitely cannot be used."
"Not the place to hang out , good for clean fresh night's sleep. Facilities neglected so no holiday feel atmosphere, breakfast is +++ ."
The atmosphere of the hotel is very nice. So nice buildings and pool and garden between buildings. Staff very friendly and helpful. Cleaning was everyday but could be better. Cleaning review 7/10. Bed had seen it's best day and could feel springs through. Also noisy bed. Shower was not the best one because the floor was very flat and water stayed there before running away. Also some water went outside so also the floor around the toilet bowl was wet because the shower wall is too small. Aircon okay also and nice balcony. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choices but only coffee is very poor! Coffee was almost like tea! So light and no taste! If you can get this hotel under 30 euro/night it is really recommendable. With 40-50 euros/night there are sure many other as good choices also.
"Clean basic rooms, amazing breakfast, pool area unkempt and environment not appealing, more of a pit stop  overnighter than a place to relax and hangout."
"Good location, great food location.
Rooms are very dated but expecting renovations soon. 
Good for 1 or 2 days but don’t expect lux.
Staff were very helpful and nice."
"the rooms are lacking maintenance.
While I understand that this maybe the result of quiet months due to pandemy, they should have close part of their rooms and focus maintenance efforts only on the ones they are selling"
"The room is standard, but was okay for the price."
"Large clean rooms. Towels need an update. Small but effective garden setting. Fabulous location right in the centre of shopping ,eating, beauty salons, everything within a very short walk. Would highly recommend this hotel. Most people staying here are very friendly. Pool area is a lot of fun. Every room has good balcony or terrace."
"if you want place with big pool for party, it will pretty good after pandemic is over"
Very friendly staff. Great buffet breakfast selection. Nice gardens and pool. Fair sized room with hot water. Central location to bars/restaurants.
Rooms basic and very outdated but at $30 per night nice place to rest up.
The hotel room is nice but dark. Got a costly restaurant below and a gym. Location is sort of crowded
Bedding needs upgrades moldy pillows asked for replacement but was given more moldy pillows also sheets were stained  and towels changed room once as bed was lumpy I understand it has been tough with COVID-19 may take some time to earn more money to buy new bedding but overall good friendly stuff
"A hotel in the traditional sense, the Paradiso is  a bit tired but is great value for money. Decent pool, nice gardens and good size rooms. You are right on the main strip but it's still quiet in the rooms. It is barely a 10 minute walk to the beach as well. I will definitely stay again"
It's a long walk to the beach...it's old but room was clean..good air con and nice hot water..pool is ok with a swim up bar...breakfast was just ok..omelette juice coffee toast etc...hey it's pretty good value overall just a long walk to the beach..but lots of restaurants and shopping straight out the front door..for the price I would possibly go back again.. overall ok
"Staff was very friendly but it’s was not as hygienic as the reviews said, the fitness room was old and not maintained, no spa that is dying, swimming pool was oke, the place is in a crowded place with a lot of ppl want too sell you stuff and asking for things"
Located at the centre of Kuta market. Staff is not supportive. They didn't reserve the room that we booked. Instead tried to give downgraded room with single beds. We had to fight to get a decent room with double bed.
"I believe this hotel has everything you could want, the things that need to Changes are the Air cons and a better shower system, its not the best with a bath."
"Good location but the property is getting a little old.
Big rooms and nice cold air conditioning."
The rooms were not so clean during my stay.
"The staff is very friendly, but the hotel looks a lot better in the photos then it does in reality, I am sure it as seen better days....
The location is not what I was looking for either, In the middle of total touriste  madness....still cheap enough to be acceptable..."
"Before covid we use to stay here often as the location is awesome.
Unfortunately they have reopened with out any maintenance and the place is run down.
Mould in the rooms broken shower head, dirty sheets with hair and cigarette holes.
Until they renovate I can not recommend."
"Location so near to legian and kuta, u can rent bike, grab food or go to the club and cafe just by walking distance. But the room old and have smells, the AC not so cold, the light so dim."
"A good place to tune up while in transit. While the rooms are not new, the garden and the gym make up for the difference. The garden is very Zen and the gym has enough equipment in it for you to get back in gym going mode."
There were Ants 🐜 every In The Room  Towels Not very Clean Ants in The Bed No Phone
"No Tv in the room, dark cause of insufficient lighting. Good breakfast and staff.AC was bit weak"
Location great breakfast was great to better than I would have thought. Rooms are good for the price only thing that lets it down is the man at reception was not so friendly.  Nice gardens
"Staff didn't know how to manage the costumer
We needed 3 hours only for check in,"
Some staff are friendly. Great location. We booked one of the dearest rooms. To no air conditioning and a broken bed. Took over 24hrs to fix. Then we book for 3 breakfast to be told no it's 2. With a 4 yr old and many ppl coming into the room.while she tries to sleep at night. To just  look at aircon.  Ask about changing hotels. Told no refund will be given. Booked 4 rooms for our group and np aircon works the best. And no TV in one. And we pay for top room
the poolside rooms were quite nice but the deluxe rooms are not that nice to stay in. make sure you check the sheets before you sleep in them and check the face works.
Just stay 1 day. The room is big . But smell old and  not good. The towel and badroom aminities not good. Theres coffe n tea maker .. but no water no coffe and no tea ?? Make it good guys .. cmon..
"Cheap hotel, seriously ageing rooms with visible mould. There are similar cheap hotels in better nice around. The pool was good, the pool bar was cheap and good, if that's what you're into. The breakfast was mainly reheated leftovers from the previous night. I wouldn't stay here again because there's better around. Unfortunately they haven't maintained this place."
They charge me 2 yimes for same item
"Basic, ageing accommodation. Nice pool, safe and secure place. Breakfast was limited due to the covid downturn,  but staff were great."
"Cleanliness, gym and food need to be improved"
"They didn't even provide drinking water, expecting the guest to thirst to death"
Just don't buy the breakfast unless you get a very good deal. Rooms are spacious and generally quiet
A bit of money spent would go a long way to make this hotel look good.  Drinks at bar are very expensive + 21% tax
got our rooms mixed up. didn't give us right rooms paid for. other than that wasn't too bad
"I didn’t stay , on arrival I was told my room had issues and not available due to water damage , I had to find another hotel at midnight , not happy"
Stayed cause location and cheap but no its not great
"Whole place is very tired.. pool area sad.  loose step ladders into pool.. loose + Broken tiling around pool..
Shower water floods bathroom floor.  Noisy people above.banging doors.and can hear water pipes of neighbours showering. TV crap..should just remove it..bad internal electrical power points loosely fitted (possibly dangerous) noisy fridge..and air-conditioning..  very basic accommodation but then again.. it reflects the paying price I guess.."
"If u don’t lie the food their is plenty of food places near by , bar nice"
"Too many mosquitoes in the room and the AC didn’t work. Broken safe deposit box,  TV not working, the shower faucet is a mess.  And it annoyed me that a male receptionist tried to speak only Japanese to me even though I talked to him in English. It just made it harder to communicate"
"You get what you pay for.. very old rooms and tiny, furniture from the 80's. Breakfast was limited.  Needs a serious facelift or a demolition expert."
"The staff were nice and helpful but the room was dirty, and broken. Peeling paint, rust, dirt. I stayed 3 nights and cancelled the rest."
"Have stayed here previously before pandemic and it was suitable for the money.  My recent 1 week stay was a totally different experience.  Breakfast buffet was the bare minimum,  phones have been taken out of rooms due to no room service available, no hot water for showers. Shower was mouldy, fridge was mouldy, walls and ceiling were mouldy and dirty. The hotel has become very run down and neglected.  My family and I have decided we could not stay here again as it's not even worth the cheap price anymore.  Western hotels will be our choice for accommodation for our next visits to Bali."
"You get what you pay comes very appropriate in this case. Location wise is very strategic. Lots of shops and warung food just in front of hotel which was open till late. However cleanliness wise was zero! Room was extremely dirty and filty with blood stain on the mattress and hair all over the floor and toliet. Towels were extremely dirty. I asked reception for a room change but he said that was the last room available as mine that i booked for was a upgraded room type deluxe room. Apparently that was the last room left. So i had to ask housekeeping to change the bedsheet for me and get extra towels to ""manage"" the night. However least did i expect there to be more BLOOD stain on the blanket quilt as well!! I have taken photos  of it and informed receptionist about it in the morning. However, all he said was there was nothing he could do about it and I have to go through Agoda as I booked it here for them to follow up. I am extremely disgusted with the room and need a follow up from the appropriate one. Thank you."
I thought I had grabbed the most awesome sale when I saw these so cheap. It shouldn’t be the sale price … it should just be the price! Didn’t look like the pictures. Left after night one even though had paid for 2 rooms for 5 nights.
"It’s a very very cheap hotel, if you’re a solo traveler or with group who just want to have a covered place for sleeping, then you may consider this. Otherwise, there are a lot more better options in the area."
"Accommodation is rundown. 
Linen in hallway all day. 
Towels did not smell fresh. 
Bathroom not cleaned properly.
Do not sign up for breakfast, you’ll be disappointed even  if you have low standard."
"a very dated and run down hotel. Every aspect of the hotel from the decor, to the bedsheets, bed, bathroom, towells seem to come from the 1980's.
Location is good to the action in Kuta, thats the only good point for this hotel."
Got bedbug. The condition of the hotel is very bad. Very noisy and drunk people around the pool almost every night.
Breakfast very bad and hotel is old.
"Very run down, not well maintain n not clean especially the toilet. No floor towel n facial tissue box"
"On arrival I could tell the place was old, which added to it's charm. Unfortunately, it wasn't until I entered my room that I realised, the place was also seriously neglected. Shortly after check-in I advised reception that I found the sheets on the bed to be dirty, basically house keeping came changed a pillow case, tucked in duvet and wanted to leave. I had to insist they change the sheets, I'm glad I did, seriously you would have been shocked. In the morning I found that the toilet didn't work and the bathroom had no towels. And housekeeping told me ""towels finished"". I think they meant they'd run out. So I packed up my stuff and found another hotel. By the way Legian Paradiso Hotel reception staff didn't offer a refund, in fact didn't bat an eyelid. Location was great!"
"Arrived at 2.30 in the morning the flight with Jetstar was delayed 2 hours got shown to our rooms mould on the walls the beds appeared to have not been made the sheets were filthy with stains on them slept on top as it was so late got new rooms next day they were okay.No tv that was in English the room was cleaner but small, had friends loose a night because they refused to stay the bar only had beer no spirits or wine the wife was not happy stayed 4 nights would not recommend."
Needs complete overhaul! Only godd thing is location.
"Avoid, not worth at whatever price. Major renovations needed. Rooms had cobwebs, shower and tap broken, very dirty bathroom, etc. the property is not maintained in general.
The staff tried to help re-clean the bathroom in a rush, but that didn’t help.
Worst of all - I booked with Breakfast Included. They said the restaurant is closed and instead offered free upgrade facing pool. But the worst thing is that - my booking is already for Deluxe Pool View room and the room is just miserable."
"Needs renovation, towel smell bad after getting wet , staff good 
Cheap"
"Fridge, TV, phone did not work.
The room was absolutely filthy with mold.
Sheets/towels were grey with stains.
When I asked for an iron I was told the hotel didn’t have one at all by reception.
Oh & don’t bother asking them to book a taxi, you’ll end up with a family member trying to rip you off for the fare."
Good location
Poorly organised and rooms average
"This hotel is in serious need of a renovation. Everything is falling apart, water leaking from the light fittings, sparks coming from power outlets when you plug in anything, the pool is filthy. Do not book here unless you have absolutely no other option!"
Oh no again
"The hotel is rundown, dirty, thousand of bad bug, no staff around, this hotel shouldn’t take anymore guest if they didn’t prepare to do any maintenance. Everything in the room is really old, dirty, n disgusting. We book 2 bedroom, for 4 night, we only manage to use it one night it only because we come n check in very late we got no other choice than to sleep in this dirty , smelly n horrible bed. The next day my daughter had thousands bed bug bitten. Agoda pls check the property before you sell to customers,it is really unfair for people come for holiday and stress out looking for other more suitable accommodations. The shower got bandage all around, the sink floded everytime, the toilet water dribbling all the time, the bathroom door falling apart, eaten by insect, garden overgrown, rubbish everywhere, it’s more like a gosh hotel ."
"Please Keep away, rooms are disgusting"
Service is bad
Left and moved to new hotel. Long story short it took them three days of asking to simply get a towel.
"Horrible room , we changed 3 diff rooms all had broken ac , water leaking and filthy toilets . Worst stay of my life"
not recomment at all
"We had a great stay at the Legian Paradiso .Nice clean garden view balcony room was quiet .Great breakfast plenty of choice with bacon just ask they get it from the kitchen .
Nice pool area swim up bar excellent .The only thing that lets it down was all the patrons hog the towels and leave them in the rooms so then there are not enough the next day by the pool .They fixed this small issue and got towells for us .
The other major problem was the two menus at the pool one had food and drink in it then another just for drinks at a different price so we were charged from the new drinks menu .The food by the pool was very average from the Bloody Sweet restaurant at the front stick with the chips and the sandwiches as the pizzas were terrible frozen not freshly made and were tasteless very average pizza .
The drinks and the food by the pool is expensive for Bali we read this from another reviewer but overall a great stay nice staff and clean rooms very happy with the room and hotel in general .Hope this helps others my fiance and i had a great holiday in Legian close to shops and the beach would stay again just more savvy next time with the pool bar and food there .More beers specials happy hour would be good as they do irish beers and cocktails do three for the price of two Bintang and that would be perfect .
The breakfast was excellent thanks Legian Paradiso great stay Paul and Tania"
"Having read all the reviews here I decided to try this hotel despite some pretty bad reviews as I was only in Bali for 4 nights for a dentist trip and it was close to everything. On arrival at the airport I was met by Made and he was great, he chatted all the way to the hotel and explained all about the hotel which gave me a good incite to what was happening at the hotel. Check in was a breeze and I was shown to my room by Made. Now look if you are looking for a swanky 5 star room, this is not the place for you however if you are looking for a good clean room with all the basics for a good price this is it. Free WIFI (very good), TV, aircon, nice shower, large comfy bed, room service every day what more could you ask for ?? Anyways you are in Bali and the room is just for sleeping in right !!!!
Breakfast was included and it was nice and just what is needed to start the day. Egg station where you can get eggs any way you like, there was fried rice (yum), either chicken or beef sausages, tomatoes or potatoes, loads of fresh fruit and the general toast station with all the accompaniments. There is also tea, coffe and juices available (orange juice was amazingly nice).
The pool area is great, swim up bar with great service and plenty of sun lounges to go around. A special thank you to Putu who works in the gym. I have not been to the gym in a few years now but decided to do a few workouts. Putu was full of encouragement as well as keeping me going when I was getting low on enthusiasm. He made you actually want to go back for a workout the next day. A real lovely guy.
In summary, a really well priced hotel with all you would need while in Bali, great friendly staff, good amenities and a short walking distance to all you would need. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and I would stay there again for sure."
"Our stay at the Legian paradiso was good. Initially we were not happy with our pool view room. It was so small, the balcony door didn't close the whole way which let mozzies in and it was just not good enough! We went to reception and upgraded for $50 for our whole stay. Our garden view room was much better, the room was quite large and the bathroom was really nice compared to the pool view room bathroom. The staff at this hotel are all so lovely! Always smiling and engaging in conversations with us. We would recommend this hotel to people who aren't really fussed by luxury living but want a perfect location for shopping in Legian and Kuta! Overall we were quite happy with this hotel and would most likely stay there again!"
"I stayed for 7 nights.  The room was comfortable and serviced daily.  the staff were great, laid back but happy to help/talk if you wanted.  The breakfast was delicious.  The ppol area is great - good size and plenty of deck chairs. I had a deluxe garden view room.  The hotel is quiet and relaxing but right in the midst everything.  easy walk to the beach, Kuta etc.  i didn;t need to catch a cab at all.  My family has previusly stayed at Legian Paradiso in 2003 and 2008.  it is still has the same great features but the renovations have modernised it, added rooms and updated the pool area.
i will definitely stay there again and it is very good value for money."
"Had a wonderful stay at legian paradiso. The staff were amazing, they couldn't do enough for us. The location was great close to everything. It is old but the rooms are clean and the facilities are good. Nice gardens and pool was goos especially with the swim up bar. Only down side was our transfer from airport to our hotel. We were at airport waiting for over an hour and no driver so we caught a taxi. Same thing happened to my friend but the hotel staff organised a ride for them promptly. All in all great stay and deffinently would stay there again.
Can't thank the staff enough for a lovely stay"
"We stayed at the Legian Paradiso in October 2013.
The location was great, on Jl Legian close to the restaurants and shopping.
The rooms were clean and bright & the room staff were wonderful and attentive.
The restaurant staff were friendly and always had a lovely smile.  Special mention of Sudi - she was lovely & friendly and always had a smile for everyone.
The pool area was bright and beautiful and not shaded by buildings which was lovely.
The daily breakfast was fresh and filling and a great start to the day.
Would definately recommend to families, couples, singles as even though it is on the main road, once you step through past the restaurant it is quiet and peaceful"
"We booked Legian Paradiso whilst we were in Bali this week, changed from a hotel that we had booked to stay in for the whole week but didn't like it. Had stayed at Legian Paradiso 12 months earlier and knew this would be a satisfactory change.  Love the atmosphere around the pool and the pool bar, that staff in the pool bar are friendly and service is exceptional.  We booked a deluxe pool view room, on the 1st floor with a balcony overlooking the pool, the only downside was the air conditioner didn't work as well as we would have liked but other than that can't fault the room and the cleanliness.  The move to this hotel saved would could have been a disastrous holiday in terms of accommodation. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again."
"The Legion Paradiso Hotel offers a great stay for couples, independent travellers and families. The room was clean and of a good size and cleaned to a good standard everyday. All the staff were very friendly and always willing to help. We organised our tours through the hotel and were pleased with the options they provided. The swimming pool and surrounding area provides and great place to relax. The breakfast was always great with a variety of options. Overall I would very much recommend it as a mid range hotel to stay in Bali."
A big thumbs-up for the Legian Paradiso!!  Had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is near Legian's main drag (although quite a way away from Kuta!) but far enough from the road for noise not to be an issue. The hotel staff were very attentive and offered good service. The rooms were a great surprise as they were very spacious and matched with an equally spacious bathroom. I would have no qualms in recommending this hotel!!
I have never stayed at the Legian Paradiso before so i was only going by what people were saying on the internet.I was hoping i had booked a good place as i had booked for 3 friends as well. It was cheap and affordable and when we got to the hotel at 1am in the morning the reception staff were very quick to book us into our rooms It was great for a 3 star hotel i will stay there again.The massage place next door was fantastic . All the staff at Paradiso were very helpful ... I would recommend Paradiso to anyone that wants cheap and a convenient hotel. Loved it :)
"The Legian Paradiso is in a great position for families and couples, really close to Kuta nightlife and Kuta beach but reserved from the main commotions so you still get peace and quiet if that's what your after. A traditional, warm and pleasant design to the hotel and the rooms are extremely spacious."
"Arriving late at night we were greeted promptly at reception with welcome drinks. We were in our room within 10 minutes. The staff were faultless and bent over backwards for everyone. In terms of standards the 3 star hotel was everything we expected. If you want fancy decor pay for 5 star. The location was perfect, we only caught one taxi the whole time. Close enough to he nightlife but not too busy. Would definitely stay here again!! Thanks all the staff at legian paradiso."
"We really enjoyed our stay! we were 3 busy mum's away without the kids so somewhere cheap and cheerful was what we wanted.  We had 3 single beds in the room so a bed each and no need to share, the room was cleaned daily and topped up with bottled water which was great.  You get what you pay for with regards to standard of room and dated furnishing etc but we didn't care about those things.   The food from the restaurant is the food that you can have at the pool and it was delicious - loved the spring rolls for lunch :) price of food and drink was well priced.  The only thing that we didn't like was that smoking was allowed at the swim up bar - and for us being non-smokers we didn't feel like we could sit and chill at the swim up bar as much as we would've like to have.  Other than this tiny trivial thing we would definitely stay at the Legian Paradiso again :) :)"
"Legian Paradiso is in a great location with bars, restaurants and everything you want at your doorstep. 
In the hustle and bustle area of Kuta/Legian but is very quiet as the rooms are set back in the hidden gem of what it is. 
Great pool area with swim up bar
Breakfast is ok with an egg station for fresh cooked eggs  any way you want them, also with a fresh pancake station."
"Was a good place to stay if you just need something standard. Staff were very friendly and helpful, they always kept the hotel clean and tidied rooms. Rooms could be more modernized as they seem a little run down. Only negative about the rooms were that the aircon leaked water. Location was prime, right near shopping areas, 5-10 minute walk to the beach and up the road from the main clubs in Kuta.
My friends and I had a pleasant stay at Legian Paradiso Hotel"
"The Legian Paradiso is a wonderful place to stay. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The hotel itself is located in an ideal place, walking distance to Kuta, beaches and a great hub of shops and restaurants/bars.
Would definitely recommend it to singles/couples or families"
"We enjoyed our stay at Legian Paradiso. Staff were friendly and helpful, great value for money. Great location close to beach, shopping and lots of places to eat. Only thing I would say that I didn't really like was the pool was almost hot water, apart from that it was Greta and would come back for sure."
"We had a great stay, booked 2 standard/superior rooms(interconnecting)and we were upgraded to the pool view/access rooms, which was lovely. 
My in-laws met us in Bali as we live in Tasmania and they live in Perth.
The front desk personel were superb in organising(last minute)a divine flower arrangement, for my in-laws.
George the Manager allowed us a late check-out for a small fee and free transport to the airport.
THANKYOU GEORGE
The Legian Paradiso is true to it's name 'Sweet Paradise' 
We will be back!"
"i had the pleasure of staying 3 nights at lgian paradiso hotel.
though i have been to bali many times yearly, however, this si my first x stays at this hotel. we took 2 rooms (2 couples). what makes this hotel stood out amongst the rest is location...location...location. i love the place. the location is a plus point. as u come out from the hotel, u are met with linings of shops. on y0ur left is towards the ground zero and to your right is towards legian art market.. we were there zuring eufa cup and the hotel provides big screening at the cafe/bar.  however, the breakfast buffet is just a simple one. nothing too fancy.. on the whole, i would recommend this to anyone who wish to stay in this place as shopping is accessible and 10 mins walk to poppies lane. worth considering.,."
This was my second stay at this hotel and once again I loved my time here. On arrival I was given a free upgrade from deluxe pool view to a super deluxe pool view room. The rooms are a bit dated and especially the bathrooms could do with an update but this place is definitely value for money. Our room was right across from the pool where you'll always meet other really friendly guest to have a chat and a drink with. All staff are so friendly and helpful. Location is great right on Jl Legian with everything in walking distance. Will be staying here again on our next visit to Bali.
"I only stayed for 3 nights this time, but the Legian Paradiso once again excels itself in value for money, the staff are all very kind, more than happy to help. The grounds are beautifully kept, the rooms are well cleaned each day, the food is delicious and the beer is cold, what more could you want!"
Nightmare!
Although the facilities are old they are ın a large garden which is away from street hectic traffic and noise. Stuff is nice . But they should renovate the place and equipments. But money wise is worth it...
"Was a lovely hotel just a shame the rooms are run down a bit , but I guess for 3 star it was ok , staff were more than helpful and very accomodating 
Great location on Legian street with plenty of places to eat and shop"
It's an old hotel with run down facilities. But it's still popular because if it's price and location. And I believe they have many repeat customers who have been staying there always whenever
"We were given a room that had a broken latch on the main door, sewage stench in the bathroom, stained roof coz of seepage.
On repeated requests they changed the room.... One with two single beds joined to convert into a double bed.... Only problem being that it had only one single bed blanket.... We informed them that its cold for two people to share a small blanket, but they said hotel was 'full' and they didn't have a blanket to spare !!! 
Don't they have to give one blanket on the single bed???
We suffered for two nights and constantly kept asking for a blanket .... They finally gave one on the last day .
I  would call my experience here very traumatic and I found the staff to be very indifferent to the situation ....
Would never go or let anyone I know stay at this property ..... Absolutely horrible"
