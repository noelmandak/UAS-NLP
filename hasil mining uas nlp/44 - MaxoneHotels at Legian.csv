"We loved this place, we stayed in 3 different places in Legian but we wished we had found this place first, the pool area is lovely, nice big pool for a swimming, the rooms were a good size & clean! We have been travelling a few months so we need to go on the cheap end & we both said this was incredible value for money! Just a short walk to the beach & plenty of bars & restaurants on your doorstep! We really loved it here & would 100% stay here again!"

"We loved this place, we stayed in 3 days. Just a short walk to the beach & plenty of bars & restaurants on your doorstep! We really loved it here & would 100% stay here again!"
"The location is good, u can reach Kuta beach or beachwalk mall under 10 mnt.
But prefer using motorbike then car, the traffic so crowd.
Can't wait to stay here again..!!"
"It is nice and clean room, near party location & Pool, with  nice  pool & huts at rooftop.
Have restaurant,  and big parking and balcony in rooms. Stayed a week.
Just wifi is ok"
"Glad I was able to book at Boss Legian, love the ambiance. Value for money.. very clean too. Would like to stay here again in the future. Just that the pricing fluctuates, sometimes it's affordable and sometimes the rate just skyrockets. It would go up like 4x the price of my previous booking."
"Got a room for 2 nights while it was on discount. 
Pros: relatively clean, really helpful staff, good location, nice TV with lots of channels. 
Cons: slow WiFi, sink was clogged.
I'm not complaining though - for that kind of money, some concessions would have to be made and this place has great value. It's clearly a little old but it seems to have been taken care of."
Great stay for us. Kids enjoying their time in the kids pool while me and wife relaxing in the cabana. Location is close to the beach by walking. Souvenir stores and bar also walking distance. We will come back here for sure.
"This is a good budget hotel. Everything is fine for example the room is fine, good channels on tv, clean bathroom with soap/shampoo and toothbrush/toothpaste, clean towels and daily replenishment if needed. Two bottles of water a day and housekeeping daily(but I’ve been here for 5 days and they haven’t changed my sheets only made the bed) My only complaint, yes complaint, as after 5 days it’s become abit of a hassle for me, is that there is no fridge or kettle in the room. If I want a coffee or tea I need to constantly go to the store and I can’t have cold drinks avail. Sigh I’m spoiled because all these have been available throughout my trip at every budget hotel in bali so far. Wifi is also whack and I work remote. There is a balcony but the view is not exactly pleasant, also pls fix the leak under the pool that drips to the second floor where you have buckets collecting that water. It looks bad and makes me have anxiety like a freak accident waiting to happen. That’s my view lol. So far throughout my budget stay in Kuta/Legian I would recommend Transera Kamini or Bakung Sari. 🤍 Boss Legian"
Basic facilities and old rooms but kept clean. Good location
"bed mattress hard, pillow too soft, not clean room, breakfast a view choice, no kettle, wastafel broken, need more maintenance."
Easy to g anywhere.
"One of the cheapest three star hotel in Kuta. The hotel itself is located in a quite prime location, quite close to the nearby beach and its surrounding bars. There is also a Circle K near the hotel, making any shopping convenient.
However, the cleanliness of the hotel room could be improved, as there were some bloodstains and black spots on our bedsheets. 
At the time of our stay, it frequently rains and some water puddle could form up in the hotel's lobby and corridors. This is also a thing to be improved upon.
Another weird thing is that our balcony and bathroom door couldn't be locked as the lock seems to not fit the housing.
Other than that, all the hotel's facilities worked as intended. WiFi, TV, and hot water are all working properly. This hotel is to be considered if you're looking for a budget place to stay while in Kuta."
Will stay again. I enjoyed the view of Legian from the rooftop pool. Only downside: In a quieter area with many shops still not yet open nearby.
Squeaking wooden bed but i’m fine with it. Room condition is great for the price paid. I’m satisfied with my stay here.
"If you’re looking for an affordable place in Legian area, this one is always be my go-to-hotel. The staffs are nice, the room isn’t that bad. Value for money 👌🏼"
Best price
"Stay with family, have a room for family with two large bed, so cool"
The location is strategic to go while you were here for your visit
Worth with the value
quite nice living area around Legian.
Not bad if you’re not a picky traveler. The kind that just uses the room for shower and sleep. Do ask them to change your sheets cause even tho I had housekeeping everyday for the past now 5 days they did not change my sheets yet. Rooms don’t have kettle or fridge but there is a store around the corner. Decent sheets and towels. Good channels. Nice pool and view on the roof. Wifi non existent. All in all it’s a decent hotel.
Cheap easy to get too. Near lots of cafes.
Worth it to stay
"Pasti kesini lg 👍🏻 awalnya cm book 3 mlm, jd seminggu"
This hotel was superb for its price due to new years season but one thing is missing is the linen and the room already molds a lot but overall its nice
AYA is very good at her job. Always helpful and smiley face
the electricity in the room is often off
"I like it but my girlfriend didn’t like it,"
"Good location but cleanliness needs to be improved.  I stayed on the ground floor, and the windows can lead to the corridor, which is a little unsafe for women.  The sound insulation of the room is not good, and the air-con pipe leaks. Although I called someone to fix it, it still couldn't be fixed... And the bigger problems are, I was bitten all over my body by fleas on the bed."
Hotel is ok. Personal is nice and location is very good but rooms are not very confortable
"Wi fi is bad.
Room is small.
Bad soundproofing.
Not enough lights in the room."
"Good price, helpful staff, near legian beach by walk, however need a lot of renovation and cleanliness need to be improved."
"first try choose family suite room. quite spacious room with double queen bed. i'm stayed 2 adults & 2 kids. still have 1 space more.
overall okay for me. the price is cheap. thank you"
Good budget hotel staff amazing price good close to everything. Thank you  I you
"Of all you’re looking for is a bed and bath the price is right. Wouldn’t want to spend a lot of time in the room though, quite small. Rooftop pool area is great, though!"
Cheap price.U get wat u pay for.
They didn't even change the bed sheets when l check in.  The bed smell the previous occupancy sweat. And the bed made too much noise when you turn around.
"The room is big, but not very clean."
"Musty smell, dirty bathroom, unclean linen, sticky table. Generally unhygienic and poorly maintained hotel."
"Room was ok but the highest floor suffers from  noise coming from water pump due to swimming pool is directly a floor above.
The ground floor  room aircon is not cold."
I had unpleasant experience here. First we got room with broken wall (top of the bed) which wasnt really safe. We complaint and they moved us to another room which also had problem (water leak from the floor). Not to mention we need to wait more than an hour to get moved to this room.
"There are lots of coackroach in my room, even in bed."
Tired looking hotel impacted by the pandemic. Stayed here before but the condition is getting worse now. Rooms are not ready way beyond the check in time. Staff are not helpful
"Mah.. rooms are half decent but everything else less than desirable. When you wake up for breakfast you gonna have a laugh . Move on.
Mike. AU"
"The hotel is in terrible condition post COVID. mould, loose tiles, blood stains on linen and very dated facilities. Highly recommend avoiding this hotel no matter how cheap it appears."
"It was my second stay at Boss hotel. I enjoyed my stay still. I love the roof top area for relaxing.  Everything was fine, aircon and hot shower were working properly. Keep it up!"
"kamarnya sangat bersih,rapih, walaupun ga gitu gede tp worth it bgt, ditengah kota & staffnya jg ramah"
hotel perlu renop.pintu masa di dobrak..sarapan nasi goreng..msh banyak hotel laen yg lbh bagus dgn harga sama
This hotel very good and nice location. The staff helpful and the room was good
"Overall good place, clean room and good facilities. Strategic location 👍🏻"
"I was stying for 5 night, first room the AC is not working at all and fells like sleeping in the sauna, and moved to second rooms it’s more getting worse!!! Linen didn’t change and it’s a new room!!! Even in the linen has a sand and pillow also so smelly, also hot shower didn’t work at all! (Please put OOO in the system and do some maintenance before sell the room!) 😓🫠"
Terrible dirty nothing is good about this place
This time I was at 5th floor. The noise from the pool starts from 6 am ends at 11 pm. I checked out at 8 am..
"Staffs: Friendly and good service.
Room: Big for a budget hotel with a nice balcony.
Location: While not in the middle of happening bars and shops but only 5 to 10 min walk to them. This is a blessing in disguise for anyone looking for quiet and peaceful place to say. Also got a rooftop bar and swimming pool"
Good place to visit
Worth it to stay here
Great!
"Good hotel, small room but ok. Skip the breakfast"
"Good place and staff, near the main street of Legian."
what a nice budget hotel
"Hidden gem great room, very clean and best view from the roof"
Definitely will come back!
"The room has a dirty vibe all over
Stains on the wall, gunks in the bathroom
Smells of cigarette eventhough its a non-smoking room
There’s a cigarette burn on the table
It’s cheap for the location but luckily it was just a one night stay for us."
Booked 6 nights at family room x2. Cleanliness wasn't that great for family room.  Sink spoilt unable to use. Overall 5/10 for everything as location was great.
"Room was clean but the shower was really bad .Water was dripping from the shower light all night ! The leftover water from the sink still remain the same level even overnight, it shows how bad its clogged !"
good
Good
Super)
Very nice
Good
Para pasar una noche no está mal
nice place
Hôtel recommandations pour travailler et vacances !
"Spart euch das Frühstück, dass schlechteste Frühstück auf meiner Weltreise. Alles wird in Frischhaltefolie eingepackt und steht herum. Toast, Marmelade, kaltes Rührei, alles nicht lecker. Die Zimmer sind sauber, allerdings fanden wir die Atmosphäre ungemütlich und eher wie ein Krankenhaus. Positiv war das Bett und der schöne Pool auf dem Dach."
"Kamar bersih, Tempatnya nyaman, Lokasi strategis. Tks"
untuk harga murah ini hotel merupakan tempat yang bagus untuk sekedar tidur. nyewa motor juga di sediakan dari pihak hotel yang bekerja sama dengan rental setempat
"Ada bbrp fasilitas yg tertulis di deskripsi, pd kenyataan nya tdk ada. Tidak ada katel untuk coffee and tea ( coffee and tea sachet nya juga tdk ada ). Katanya ada safe di kamar, kenyataannya tdk ada.  Minta es batu juga tdk ada.Tdk ada gelas apapun.  Kamar banyak sekali semut.
Ranjang berderit, sehingga sedikit mengganggu saat tidur. 
Lokasi dekat dengan pantai dan pusat keramaian"
"Perlunya peningkatan dalam kebersihan tempat tidur, amenities di dalam kamar mandi masih kurang, perlu penambahan hairdyer serta proses check in yang sangat sangat lambat"
"Sesuai dengan harga, untuk parkir mobil agak susah"
"Pertama kali nginap msh agak suasana pandemi dan urusan bisnis jg jd kmr cm buat bobo.kali ini sama anak gadis dan staycation iyasi Des jd musim hujan, koridor bbrp spot bocor, air swimpool jd agak keruh, musim liburan tamu lmyn rame pas proses check-in  sikap staf gemana gt .."
Ukuran kamar kecil dan sama sekali tidak ada toleransi kalau anda terlambat cek out 😃
"Kami menginap di Family suit,  kasurnya dua besar, cocok untuk kami yang membawa dua anak. Semua kebutuhan dasar kami terpenuhi, harga juga affordable untuk kami yang tinggal lama. Staff juga ramah."
Dengan harga murah bisa mendapakan hotel yg cukuo nyaman bila bepergian sendiri  di lokasi yg strategis.

Harga terjangkau

"Harga sebanding dengan kamarnya, tapi sayang staffnya mengecewakan, tidak membantu sama sekali, kebersihannya sangat kurang sekali, temboknya mengelupas di kamar mandi, debunya banyak sekali diatas kasur, di meja, di gantungan baju dll"
"- staff ramah

"Untuk yg cari hotel murah bersih, ini sih recomended yah.."
"Agak kecewa karena ada barang ketinggalan dan hilang begitu saja :) 
Memang barang sensitif tapi seharusnya dibalikin, bukan dibuang / diambil. 
Karena saya sampai balik ke hotel lg buat ambil tu barang dan ternyata hilang. 
Semoga staff nya bisa lebih JUJUR ya. 
Thanks"
"Tempat nya bagus . Saf nya ramah , tetapi di bagian balkon nya ada sedikit berdebu 🙏🙏"
