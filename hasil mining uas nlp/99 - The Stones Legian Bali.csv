"Hotel has provided service above expectations, we spent Christmas here  staff have been so attentive, rooms are great and so well priced. Buffet breakfast has been superb, kids club is well staffed and lots of activities. Staff remember our names and greet us everywhere we go. Great central location too. Quiet, and away from the street so great nights sleep as well. Will absolutely be back. There we so many wonderful little things the staff did too, ice-creams on arrival, Christmas stocking on doors with home made cookies and gifts for everyone. Cleaning manager asked personally how he could improve the service or any feedback. Just a great running hotel. Christmas dinner was also delicious and first class. We would love to come and woukd recommend in future to friends."
Everything from the hospitality to the food to the ambiance was just amazing. A little touch of surprises also made the stay much more memorable. With the welcome popsicle to the entertaining fire shows to the prayer ritual ceremony..love it! If the hotel wasn’t fully booked I would have definitely extended my stay ❤️
"Staffs are very nice with yummy ice cream bar instead of welcome drink. 
The hotel is maintained so well, the pool is very clean and huge.
The room is very clean too."
This hotel exceeded my expactations. Highly recommend booking this if you’re thinking about it!! The pool v Jew rooms are well worth the money so you are able to watch the nightly entertainment. It’s not the most quiet of rooms so more so for the people who wish to be amongst the fun
"It was great to be back at The Stones post covid restrictions. From the moment you arrive the staff are wonderful. The rooms are clean, the pool is clean, the food is delicious from breakfast through to dinner. 
Great location, easy walk to the beach or Beachwalk for shopping. 
 
We will be back again very soon 🙏🏽"
"loved the hotel could not fault it , staff so friendly, drink and food prices around the beautiful pool were brilliant. Loved it"
"We were surprised with two towel swans and rose petals saying I Love You ❤️
We were there for only a few nights but it was so much better then what we were expecting and one of the best experiences we have had while we were on holiday, definitely 10 stars ⭐️ 🙏🏼💫"
excellent service! love the attention to details by the staffs. and the xmas stockings with candies and chocolates is a very nice touch. thumbs up!! :)
"Hospitable and very welcoming staff provided my family with the most fantastic 4 day stay. The food was amazing, the pool area spectacular and everyone enjoyed the resort very much."
"for some people experience is everything and our family is one of them.  we booked a deluxe room but we were given a free upgrade to a room with a private pool.  the experience we had while staying here was very memorable.  A 5-star hotel with all its great facilities and it is certain that the hospitality here is very good, all staff are friendly, welcoming, good greetings from all levels of staff, the appropriateness of the rooms and the facilities are undoubtedly all very good and well-maintained.  thank you for your hospitality by making our vacation as a family memorable, special thanks to the front office staffs on the day I stayed, you are great .. !!!  like a dream come true can feel living in the stone hotel legian, 5 star hotel with humble price.  very impressive.."
"Hotel with location near the beach.
In the morning you can walk on the beach and in the afternoon you can enjoy the sunset in the beach.
Located near malls and places to shop.
Service staff is friendly and fast.
Hotel cleanliness is good."
"Great location, great price, nice breakfast and  right across Kuta beach and ten minutes walk to nearby Beach walk shopping mall. 
Hotel is clean, staff is very friendly and attentive. However it does feel bit old, was probably a gem ten years back."
"It’s the little things about this hotel which makes it so good.
The only thing I think they could do better is add a few more options with their dinner, it never changes, just skewers but overall it’s great and will definitely stay again."
"Bila ingin menginap di sekitar kuta maka pastilah the stone terbaik , trust me bintang berbicara"
Friendly and responsive staff since arrival and departure...good variation and delicious breakfast..close to the action of Kuta Beach with amazing sunset..definitely will return to this hotel again on our next visit to Kuta. this was our second stay in this hotel last time was 4 years ago..the hotel is well maintained.
"This is my 2nd time to stay at this hotel. The front service, room service, and the restaurant service are the best that i feel. The staff, manager everyone give their best services and helpful"
this is a good hotel and best for the location. i just wished that they have more selection in terms of food but i understand that they are only based on the booking percentage and just came out of pandemic so i think its still ok and understadable.
"Great place to stay in Kuta. Near the beach, circle k, and beachwalk mall. The staff was very friendly and provided good offers during our stay. The breakfast was good. The room was clean and sanitized (during covid)."
Staffs were very helpful and friendly. Room was clean and location was just right in front of the beach.
"The ambience are Cozy and warm!
I like the food very much... Yummy Indonesian authentic food 😋 I feel like at home 🏡"
"The hotel was so nice and happy hour at pool bar was great.  Breakfast was lovely and atmosphere is nice. Just not a fan of 3 pm check-in, 2 pm is fine."
Where to start... the balcony bath tub was great looking over the pool they also had a swim up bar and also little huts to enjoy and our bartender TU DE was the best bartender there looked after my partner and I like we were royalty🙂
"I would like to stay at this hotel again, their staffs are very friendly 
Very good service here"
"In the heart of Kuta, easy to get around, and incredible services, even good for Solo traveler or business traveler."
Great location and great hospitaliy
"Best staff ever, so helpful and polite nothing to much trouble.
The staff make this place."
"Everything was perfect , room, service, pool , restaurant, fitness, location  ....
Terima Kasih
I ll be back for sure 
Very very happy about this hotel"
"+ the recepsionist was incredibly nice. They upgrade our room and gives extension of late check out till 3PM! The only hotel in Bali that were this kind.
The hotel is right in front Kuta beach. The building is quite big, the pool was really fun for my kid. Also they had bathub outside. Its pretty nice.
- they could improve the breakfast though. But it's understandable since the guest occupancy rates drop alot since this covid pandemi. I think they also need to survive by cutting some things. 
Overall its a good value for money."
"We are so pleased and feeling so wonderful stayed in Stone Hotel. Fast response from all staff. Clean Hotel. Great Price. 
we'll be back soon"
"This hotel has a magnificent lobby, friendly staff, clean rooms and a great breakfast. 
I will definitely be back to this hotel and tell my friends about this hotel."
"good hotel and service, keep clean and friendly staff"
We got a good bargain for this hotel with a good location and friendly staff.
The hotel is meet my expectation I am comfortable staying there due to the calm atmosphere.
"Clean room, friendly and helpfull  staff and good  location"
the hotel is ok and good location
"Stunning Hotel with hospitality of the staff, everything is good"
Stay here during the Silent Day in bali
really like the cleanliness
Hotel with festive breakfast.
Over all our stay was comfortable.The hotel staff is very friendly & courteous.But we had problem with our room bathroom.There was no hot water& in spite of complaining several time they could not repair it& nor did they change the room.Other than this there was no other problem with the hotel.All was good!
The staf so friendly
"It's a fancy fairly pricey resort, you should expect nothing less than a great experience.   Staff was all great, room was nice with a bathtub on the patio area.  Pool was relaxing and drinks did their job."
Good location. Nice pool
Very good hotel
amazing hotel and staff
Great escape with huge pool
"Spacious room - no sofa as said in 2 rooms that I booked. Swimming pool is great, breakfast area is good. Location across kuta beach, walking distance to kuta beachwalk mall"
"The Indonesian government required for tourists arriving in April 2022,  three nights in a government designated hotel.   I chose The Stones because of its incomparable previous GM,  Darryn Hudson.
It is in Legian known for its party-till-your drop scene.  Most of the surrounding businesses were closed due to Covid.
I had a Zoom meeting and upon checking WiFi Internet speeds,  they were anemic.  Manager Harry and IT Manager-Guru Dwik jumped on the problem and upgraded the speeds.   Bali rightly sees itself as a digital nomad destination thus a Marriott hotel should be consistently running 40/24 as a selling point."
"Great staff, good breakfast, great room."
"It is the second  time I stay at this hotel , clean and still well maintenance, strategic location close to Kuta Beach Mall , cross the road already Legian beach, staffs are friendly and helpful and foods a lot variety and good taste. Recommend to choose this hotel for vacation."
"The Resort is overpriced for what you pay a night.  We had a pool villa and asked to change rooms, as our pool villa was looking at a fire hydrant and felt we like we would be swimming in the lobby and restaurant.  Request any room after room 121.  Staff were accomodating to change the room but the second room's layout wasn't as good as the first and we could hear the awful loud sound of next doors pool jets through the afternoon.  (Even playing music couldn't drown out the sound).  The shower constantly dripped and their were no bags stands.  The wardrobe was smaller then the first room and I couldn't fit my suitcase in it.  The buffet breakfast had a good selection of choices.  If you like doughnuts, sugary treat and ice cream for breakfast, then this is for you.  If you opt to pay at the property you will be automatically charged for services which you may or may not use during your stay.   The property is close to the beach.   Overall we are happy we'r tried it, but may not return."
"It’s a good stay, the hotel lack of worker for sure. The room is huge and kinda dusty, walk inside the room with bare food and you can tell why I said so. The breakfast is good with adequate option. F&B staffs is the best, they care to your need really love it. The manager Erin and one of the trainee Yani is really attentive to detail. Salute. It’s not easy to stay positif during this pandemic. Wish to came back when the pandemic is over."
"For the price you pay, you expect better. Overbooked hotel meant we were given a room with single beds for half our trip then swapped rooms to a king... not really acceptable when you book 6 months in advance. Resort was very nice but not much going on in the location."
Great location in Kuta. A little pricey for a hotel with quality of room a little wear down. Staff very friendly.
"Staff amazing, place needs a few minor upgrades around the pool area and entrance. Breakfast needs a few more dishes"
"The room is nice, big, but the floor and wall tile are dull. Bath towel, hand and face towel are not  in white color anymore.
would be nice if they are replaced."
"Our room was very clean and luxurious. But for the price we paid to stay here, I would expect better.
We ate at the resorts restaurant a couple of times, which was disappointing every time. They stuffed up our orders, my meal came out before my husbands and the food took 1 hr to be served.
Overall, our experience was below average."
"Was spose to right 5 star, a special thank you to Dyna who was fantastic.Give the girl a pay rise"
We lashed out and paid a lot of money and we’re quite disappointed. Unfortunately when I booked breakfast wasn’t included and refused to pay $30 per person for breakfast which would have been an extra $420 for the stay. Staff were lovely but did not fulfil our expectations as to what the price was.
"Best place,variety breakfast,good staff"
"Sad to say the place has deteriorated since then, there is no personal interaction between the staff and the guests as I’ve experienced before in other hotels I’ve stayed at in Bali. There was no effort made in trying to interact their guests in coming together around their social places eg: around the pool area. 
Great hotel and facilities if that’s what your looking for but just Don’t expect the true Balinese experience in your stay"
"Flooding bathroom
No World Cup channel at room
Button in lift not working"
Awesome service although hotel is old
"We were greeted with so much respect and courtesy, the security gates and scanners make the place feel alot safer. the lobby is amazing, especially at night and the staff are again very greeting. You are then escorted to your room and they guide you through everything in the room to make sure you are comfortable with how everything works, which is genius!
The pool view is amazing and the bath tub on the balcony just adds to the luxuries provided. Everything is air conditioned inside the hotel; hallways, rooms, gym, restaurant and wouldnt be surprised if the pool area is air conditioned because there is no humidity involved around the pool which is amazing.
The breakfast is insane, so much to choose from and such good quality food. As soon as you walk in you are asked if you want a tea or coffee, in which is made straight away. Such a variety and you can have juice squeezed fresh or omelettes made to your liking. I am a 19 year old male so food and lots of it is essential for me :)
Room service food is amazing, 3/7 nights I ordered room service because its just like restaurant quality food!
When relaxing by the pool, you have so many staff members walking around offering you service. It is abit of a walk into Kuta central and because you are at the end of a one way street, it takes a long time to catch a taxi to Kuta central, but the walk is worth it down the beach or past many shops and malls including the new 'beachwalk' shopping mall being completed just down the road, which looks so good!
The little extra you pay to stay at the Stones Hotel where as to stay somewhere else is nothing to what you get in return! The service and accommodation is like none other and I will continue to stay at the Stones Hotel by Marriott when I holiday in Bali, absolutely brilliant!"
"Although it is sometimes listed as being in Legian, it is very close to Kuta and its many facilities. The Stones is in a great location and Nusa Dua, Semyinak are all within easy reach. Ubud is quite a hike though, about 5/6 hour drive away. As for the hotel, it is very clean, and the food is excellent. Buffet breakfast, room service all actually at a reasonable price compared to the main restaurants in the area. Staff are friendly and keen, perhaps too keen at times, they can become a little irritating but they are only doing their job. E.g. If you have the do not disturb sign on during the day, they out a note through your door from housekeeping telling you they were unable to clean your room. Later in the day they come and knock on your door to tell you they were unable to clean your room...sign still on. Hotel gym is fantastic as is the pool area and you are minutes (3 min walk from the beach). Warning about the local public bus system 'Kura-Kura', don't pay for a day pass or even a three day pass. Yes they re fantastic value for money, run on time and are very clean but you literally spend most of your time on one. Better off hiring a car with a driver for the day. Avoid hiring mopeds/scooters, its like nothing else on the planet. All that said, we really enjoyed our time in Bali and the hotel was excellent. Sorry about any confusion/winging."
"The Stones hotel is quite new in Bali. I heard they're under the management of Marriott group. When you first enter this hotel, you can see from the lobby that the design is quite unique. The staffs were very friendly and well trained. The room is still new and it is very clean. If you are into minimalistic design, then you'll love this hotel. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel if you're staying in Kuta. When we stayed there, the price is relatively inexpensive because of the promotion. It should go up fairly soon. If you can get a good deal, definitely try this hotel out."
"The Stones Hotel in Legian Bali was amazing, the pool is huge. The hotel complex is set back a little from the main road that runs across the beach front from Kuta to Legian so it's nice and quiet. The beach is still only about 5 minutes walk from the hotel reception and if you like to surf you can easily rent a board and surf for a few hours.
The pool is, as I've already said, huge and absolutely beautiful. The staff at the hotel are all amazingly attentive and service is incredible. I would highly recommend The Stones Hotel and would be delighted to go back!
10/10"
"We recently spent 8 nights at The Stones Marriott, was a relatively long time to spend in Legian however we found it quite easy to remain in the vicinity whilst staying at this beautiful hotel.
We were greeted with beautiful smiles from the lovely Sedu and his colleagues when we arrived. The Stones have covered all bases when it comes to providing 5 star accommodation - the facilities, pool area, security, cleaners, restaurant and staff are all second to none.
Each morning we woke up in a comfortable bed, we showered with the lovely home made soaps provided, we would then proceed to the on site restaurant for buffet breakfast where we were treated to the delectable array of food from all around the world, we would leave the hotel only to return to security whom would comprehensively check over the vehicle we returned in and then proceed to conduct a security check on our bags - which I loved because we felt safe. 
A+ Experience
A+ Staff & Hospitality
A+ Service
A + Facilities"
"This is a new hotel that we tried when we visited the Kuta Area in Bali. All the hotels in the Kuta area are quite old and so this hotel is facing stiff competition. The great news is, this new hotel is totally up to the challenge of the older hotels there. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. The design is very unique as well. It is maintained by Marriott so you can expect the same world class, 5 star hotel experience. I was getting a really good deal on this hotel. However, I suspect the price will increase soon. Make sure you try this hotel out before the price goes up."
"This is my first time stay at The Stones Hotel, Bali arrived at the Hotel just around 2.30 pm though I was told that the check in time was 3pm, they managed to get my room ready when I arrived! Instead of welcome drinks, there was some sort of ice-cream given.. something different. I was also given the option to upgrade to the balcony with pool view for a reasonable price and this made all the difference in my stay. I would definitely recommend this room option. Room was big and spacious and clean.The food very nice and delicious. There were plenty of food during the breakfast which I couldn't have it all!!Staffs are very friendly and welcome us with great smile.The pool is really big and good which is the design different with other hotels.Not to forget about the Location is good, just walking distance to Kuta Square and the Kuta beach just across from the hotel. I would definitely come back to stay at this Hotel. Highly recommended!"
"We booked our last two nights in Bali at this hotel as our first night was spent at Nusa Dua. We did this because we wanted to experience the Kuta Area. Area is in legian, in a quieter part but not a far walk from the busier part of central Kuta. Right in front of the hotel across the street is the famous surf beach. Seminyak, with all its boutique shops, is also close. There are lots of restaurants, bars and convenience stores nearby. This is a modern looking hotel. My favorite is the pool area which is large and feels very relaxing. The rooms are very clean. I just find the bathroom unusual as they separated the toilet area and the bath area. I think they did this to save space. They have rooms with bath tubs and jacuzzis in the balcony. They also have very friendly staff. Breakfast buffet is average with limited choices, although they have a wide selection of fresh fruit juices. Overall, We were very satisfied with this hotel and we are highly recommending it."
"Our stay at this hotel gave us a very good first impression about Bali. We know that this hotel is right at the center of tourist attractions, commercial establishments as well as right across the famed Kuta beach, we never felt that we are in it. The hotel's ambiance is very relaxing, very calming and one of the best hotels we have stayed so far. Staff are well-trained, very courteous and can speak English fluently. Amenities like the pool are great. The room we have stayed is at the second level fronting the pool, and what a great view indeed. The room is of the right size with the bathtub cleverly placed at the terrace. It's also good that the hotel is around 20-25 mins away from the airport and within walking distance to the commercial establishments and restaurants nearby. If we ever have the chance to be back in Bali, we would definitely stay again at The Stones Hotel."
"This is a new hotel under Marriott's Autograph Collection brand. My type of design - fuss-free, clean, modern and refreshing. Breakfast buffet was good. The resort is shaped as an enclosed property, and is quite a distance away from the beach. Definitely my current choice of hotel in Legian if only purely by design and cleanliness."
"I had a great time staying in the Marriott's Autograph Collection, The Stones Hotel, Bali. I loved the plunge pool in front of my room. I wish to be able to come back and stay with the Stones in the future."
"Nice Hotel, with good restaurant with good price and food 
also in evenings. Perfect surfing beach for new beginner straight outside Hotel. Talk with Pro surfer next to the Hotel. Restaurant Sardinia in Beachwalk Mall is a very good alt. dinner place with big menu. Going upwards direction to Legian just behind the gates along the beach is Ocean terrace with Asian in one area and International in Ocean area.Nice place to sit at in evening. On Tuesday they have a simple buffet but a very nice Fire dance performance worth to enjoy included in buffet price. Benoan area is NOT for underwater activities, you have to go further away to get better waters. Do NOT go to Bali Zoo, over priced and a lot of sad animals as in every Zoo. Water Bom Park was nice if you like water rides. Enjoy some outdoor activities like rafting, visit some temples, take a ride to the Volcanos. Food is good and cheap every where except the tourist buffet stop places (just ok to eat). Watch out for drivers that try to make much longer ride time then you need. Enjoy the stops, but you don't have to buy anything. And NO, silver items are just badly plated metal scrap. There may be some exception in special stores, but the most common is not what you want."
"I spent my New Year in Kuta, Bali and was glad to have chosen The Stones. The hotel staffs were great despite the high volume of travelers. The rooms are kept nice, clean and comfortable by the relentless room service staffs, twice a day. Kuta beach is just right in front of the hotel and for my room with pool view, i also get to see fireworks from my balcony at night. Food is great here too, one of the best for hotel standard. it is also not outrageously priced as most hotels do."
"We are frequent younger Bali travellers who had our first stay at the stone hotel in Legian the security was very high at this hotel which was comforting in the bombing that happened in Jakarta. Once we checked in we were advised that he had been upgraded to a suite with a plunge pool this room was very nice however we had found it hadn't been cleaned properly before we come in (only one towel on the rack l, floor mat was wet from previous use, used hotel shampoo, conditioners and body wash were left in shower) however this did not fade us calling reception to get new towels delivered and the shower soaps binned. Other then this small hiccup I would recommend this hotel we had a lovely stay and will be returning again"
"I stayed 5 nights at The Stones Hotel with my Mum and we had a wonderful time. The hotel is located centrally in Legian/Kuta and close to the beach (unfortunately no private beach, but you will need to rent sun loungers from the locals - good negotiation skills are key!) The staff at the hotel are great, and really remembered our names from Day 1. Breakfast was a good choice but it got very crowded so be prepared for long queues for fresh orange juice and at the egg station. Overall a nice relaxing stay! I would recommend the hotel to other guests"
"Our decision to stay at the The Stones Legian, Bali was the best we could have made. It was affordable but at the same time you pay a premium and you get what you pay for with quality all around you. The swim up pool bar and the pool side cabanas were great fro meeting people. The nightly entertainment was superb. All in all the experience was memorable and we will certainly be returning there with our new found friends. Don't hesitate staying here."
"We enjoyed our stay there.  The breakfast buffet and pool with swim up bar were nice and a jacuzzi as well, gym amazing. 
 The only thing we were more than a bit off put by was that we were put in a tiny little first floor room looking at nothing but shrubbery. We went immediately back to the front and asked for an upgrade. The guy we dealt with at the front desk was stuffy and in no uncertain terms let us know that they charge much more at the hotel than those booking through Agoda like he was irritated that we received a good deal. He said to move to another room we had to pay more blah blah. We did. I also encountered this attitude at another of the four hotels we stayed at during our first trip to Bali. The other two had no problems , and upon extending our stay at one which we loved, were willing to beat Agoda by $5. Also, our upgrade at the stone had an immediate leak in bathroom ceiling which was quickly fixed. All in all, of our four hotels, it was very nice but not our favorite by far."
"This Hotel is excellent just in the middle between Legian and Kuta. The traffic in Bali is one of the worst that I´ve ever seen, so you have everything within a walking distance from this Hotel. If you don´t want to walk, just outside the hotel you can rent one scooter for just six (6), yes 6 USD for 24 hours. Good shops, delicious food and great nightlife also very near. If you are looking for party, go to SKY GARDEN in Legian. Just 1km from this Hotel."
"I spent Christmas and new years in Bali at the stones hotel it was a great experience the checking was fast the room was clean big and comfortable, the pools are big with a hot tub to relax in. The staff were fantastic to say the least and the restaurant was amazing the food was 5 star i enjoyed every meal and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend the food the wagyu and tenderloin steaks are the best i have eaten, There is a buffet breakfast and freshly squeezed juices, The beach is at the front of the hotel and shops with in walking distance i will defiantly stay at the stones next time i visit Bali."
"The Stones is situated right smack in Kuta for you to enjoy the hustle and bustle of Bali, but in a corner for you to also enjoy enough tranquility and relaxation. Service was exceptional, as were the facilities and decorations. I was unsure about staying at The Stones because Bali is teeming with cheaper alternatives, but now I am beyond certain that I will be staying at here during my future visits to Bali!"
"Nice clean room was good with comfy bed. Had an outdoor bath overlooking the pool, which was big and enjoyable. Location across the beach."
So exvensive for View with full garden.
"I never want to stay anywhere else. This place is so incredible. The staff, rooms, pool, cocktails, breakfast and food in general is amazing."
One small thing that would improve a stay would be heated splash pool for rooms that that have that facility. Apart from that a great hotel. Really enjoyed the night time entertainment.
The best pool in legian
"This place is paradise! the premises!! the staff is super firendly!! the food is super yummy!! the location can not be better!! the bedrooms are wow!! the cleanliness!! the vibe!!!! Loved my time at The Stones, and will come back for sure!!!!"
"Great hotel….staff wonderful, food excellent, rooms very nice and clean…overall a rewarding experience."
Good place
"We are so thrilled with the staff at the Stones! John, Jeafen and all staff were so helpful and lovely! The pool was so clean and they bring out free icie poles while you are sunbathing.. we will be back soon thankyou to everyone there. Kids club was excellent my kids loved it and again the Staff were amazing"
Best hotel in bali! Everything was perfect and John at reception looked after us so well. Thankyou we will return so soon
"I felt very special here during my stay with the staff getting to know me by name.
Nothing was ever too much trouble for them... Everyone really friendly.  I can't wait to come back."
Drinks are way too expensive and they have a weird voucher system
"Great hotel & liked the location near the beach and access to stores/restaurants a short trike/taxi ride away.  Nice to go to the beach close by for the sunsets as well.  The staff was great & so friendly, always had a great attitude, made the stay a very pleasant one."
perfect
Perfect
perfect
"As soon as you pull up you feel like royalty. They open the car door and greet you and had our luggage sent directly to our room. The foyer and check in area is exquisite and the ladies in the traditional Balinese formalwear offering refresher towels and drinks was a welcome arrival gift!
 The staff go above and beyond. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming.
The breakfast spread is just amazing – everything you could possibly want is on offer and the coffee is honestly the best I have had anywhere in Bali – which is critical for me in the mornings!
The 6 hour two for one cocktail hour at the pool bar definitely won me over! The long island ice tea certainly corrected my mild case of Bali Belly!! The bar staff know how to make a great cocktail and are all ready for a laugh and a chat while you wait. 
We upgraded to the poolside plunge pool room – and I have to say that I would definitely not book this room again. I had assumed the plunge pools would be warm and they definitely were not!! Not ideal for a late night dip during wet season in Bali! Would be better suited to hot season if you required a refresh after a long day out.
The rooms were lovely and suited us as a couple and the bottomless mini bar was very welcoming. The location, service and pool area won us over and we will definitely recommend The Stones to all of our friends travelling to Bali, thank you so much to everyone who made our stay so amazing!"
It was the best holiday accommodation I’ve stayed in when In Bali and I’ve been to so many hotels staff were amazing and so friendly I would definitely recommend
"This is probably the best luxury hotel on the Kuta Beach Strip. Excellent food and very friendly staff. It is within walking distance to all the action in Kuta and Legian. However, the design and rooms are very modern that when you're in it you don't really feel like you're in Bali."
"Absolutely beautiful rooms balcony and facilities and breakfast was amazing staff were friendly lovely always went above and beyond always willing to help with anything always smiling I have never had service like it all could speak very good English. Check in and check out was such a breeze facilities were A+ amazing. 
My only fault I have was I wanted to purchase the bath robes from the rooms as a holiday memory for myself and my brother but when I called the reception I was told that their were none in stock and that they were still awaiting for some to come to the hotel. 
The bath tub on the balcony maybe could have a sign to say how to empty the tub as we were unsure as to how to empty the tub. 
When I left the premises I asked to borrow a towel to take on my outing and was given a towel that had been bleached and it had ripped and frayed edges not sure if it was a towel that was used for the ground to mop things up, it was quite embarrassing when I opened the towel."
"This hotel is amazing! The food, the service... the rooms are clean and no mould smell. Always got a seat by the pool and the breakfast is to die for! Big thumbs up..."
"After 5 days the bed sheets had not been changed , hence a   complaint was made. They were very apologetic and left me a card and elephant from a towel with rose petals  scattered on bed- it was a special touch. 
There is no signage to say when happy hour is at the habit what specific drink it is today. You can but 2 frozen drinks from slurpee  machine got the price of 1. Once again - no signage and we didn’t find out until  later in our trip. 
Each day they had a different activity by pool like tug a war etc. the staff member did not engage with everyone and sometimes we didn’t know it was happening. The staff member should really motivate and engage with people to make it fun and interactive. 
Every day they have s special breakfast that you can chose. It would have been beneficial in having a brief explanation underneath of the ingredients and what it actually was.
Apparently there is a free shuttle bus to Seminyak, but we only saw this on our last day for checkout. Great staff"
"For this price, i think the facilities are not too luxurious as the price, the front desks are just general, for me not nice, too open, and the service for the front desks not excellent as the hotel's stars.
The deluxe room is just okay, the furniture are quite in old style, the toilet is not too clean as a 5 stars hotel. 
So my comparison is to Anvaya Hotel that i stayed before, sorry abt that."
"Service excellent
Buffet breakfast had a big variety 
Pool was great
Rooms are clean and comfortable.
All round good stay.
Rooms are not super flash but nice enough and clean. 
We had noisey neighbours one night at 2am that woke us and we had to make a complaint. Staff were up and spoke to the guests and we received a letter the next day informing that they would monitor our floor for noise to avoid more noise disturbances. 
Overall we left happy and would be glad to return to the hotel for another stay."
"I booked this location site unseen and was incredibly impressed when I arrived...I arrived early in the morning and had to wait about an hour for my room upon arrival...they were prompt in getting my room for me...the room itself overlooked the pool and was beautiful...they comped my breakfast for me each morning...the people working there EVEN REMEMBERED MY NAME...that has never happened at ANY hotel I have been to before...when I needed assistance with ANYTHING they were there WITHIN MINUTES and promptly resolved the issue...again, this has NEVER happened with ANY hotel I have ever stayed at previously...I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel if you need a central location there in Bali...the only drawback is the traffic...and that certainly can't be avoided when you're there in central Bali..."
"For us hotel was too big, our room wasn't worth the price, the air conditioner made a horrible noise, our tv had 3 white dots on the screen that made it hard to watch a movie. Guessing the gym was above us as we kept hearing people thumping weights down on the floor."
"We stayed here for 4 nights in a room with no balcony. The room was clean and had everything you need, however on the smaller side.
The hotel has an amazing buffet breakfast with whatever food you want, bircher muesli, eggs, pancakes, local foods. 
Also the pool bar was a big hit. 
The location is in Kuta which is a pretty busy part of town, but the hotel is reasonably quiet itself.
The gym is very spacious with ample equipment. 
Very secure hotel. 
Would recommend if you want a mid range large hotel."
"The Bed was hard, noise from adjoining room at 1.30 am, no body turned up for transfer from airport to hotel? as it was booked."
Firstly I want to say a massive thank you to all the staff in the hotel. Absolutely amazing. We came here for our honeymoon and they looked after us so well. My wife has a severe nut allergy but they went out of their way to prepare her food separately and reassured her of ingredients etc. That was a huge help for us. Such polite and caring people. The hotel was lovey and very clean. We couldn’t fault it. The only thing that could have been better was a pool DJ during the day and more lively entertainment on an evening but other than that it was perfect. Thank you for making our honeymoon stay so perfect. We will be coming back! Matt & Kelly
"Sun beds full after 9am, staff very friendly, had terrible noisy neighbours! No real area for kiddies"
This is a lovely hotel but a little overpriced and there was never anywhere to sit around the pool due to it always being so packed. The staff were all amazing though and it was super clean.
"Very good and complete meal  in breakfast.. nice staff and clean with perfect location near beach and mall. 
Of course i will recommend this hotel to friends"
"But the floor inside the room was always very humid, especially after shower."
"Absolutely loved our stay at The Stones. Our new favourite hotel. Rooms were clean, decent size. Pillows were amazing (I’m very fussy with pillows). Bed hands down the most comfortable I’ve slept in. Pool was perfect, temp was great! Staff were exceptional, couldn’t ask for better service, nothing was ever a problem."
"There are better hotel at the same rate around Kuta beach area. Staff is very friendly though. 
Deluxe room is very basic and is overrated for the price paid."
"Rooms are very spacious. Private plunge pool much colder than the outside pool so didnt use it much. 
Main pool is excellent. Floating bean bags are the best.
Pool bar very good. Specials every day help you save.
Breakfast buffet is beyond words, the huge selection is more than any hotel i have seen. They cater for every nationality.
Staff are very friendly.
Entire area is safe and clean. 
Would definitely go back to this Hotel."
The staff was friendly and helpful and the location is great very enjoy our stay
