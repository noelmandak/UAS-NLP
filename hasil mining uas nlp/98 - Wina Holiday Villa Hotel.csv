"With 3 swimming pool and 2 minute walking to the beach, Wina Holiday Villa Hotel is a great choose for group or family. Room, swimming pool, guest hall, service is very good. I will come back here when I have a chance"
"Good sized clean room, 3 pools, exit to the beach & to JL Bebesari both down  lanes."
"location is nearby kuta beach.
hotel room is clean and comfortable.
However the choice of breakfast can be improved. Same menu everyday is very boring."
"Very good facilities, services and staff"
Close to beach but very peaceful. Super nice staff and comfy beds. Only downside is no onsite restaurant due to construction but many good places nearby and grab can deliver whatever you’re craving. The perfect spot to chill for a few days and get over jet lag. Beautiful swimming pools!
Best hotel in bali.good service and all staf is good kind and always helping us.
"GoodPrice, Pool, room and services"
"Post pandemic the hotel havent seemed to have returned to its former glory years. Most of the rooms were shut down and they only had a handful guests. The location was great being 250 mts from kuta beach, the staff was responsive and kind, not a perfect place but a good deal none the less."
"I booked a family room number 211 and 212, the things that should be renovated is the knob of the bathroom door (one of them is already rusty) and the switch for the lamps (many are unavailable and doesnt work). The rest is good and okay."
Awesome location and a very nice resort!
The staff was  so niceeee... attended to all our requests. Great massage experience at d spa. I enjoyed staying here!
"Very clean hotel, location also very good, near the beach also, will book again."
No buffet breakfast like before. May be the hotel does not operate at its maximum. But easy walking to the beach and mall.
Nice hotel. Great pools. Rooms a little tired and in need of renovation. Staff were very nice
I had a very unpleasant stay at this hotel. The tap water was so salty that it was not even suitable for bathing or brushing teeth. There were mosquitoes inside the room and the land line was not working. The water heater was not working and the staff did not seem to care to fix it. The room was clean but the overall experience was marred by the traffic jams and lack of other amenities. I would not recommend this hotel for families.
A littebit out of the main road.
Best 4 star hotel in kuta
I have stayed countless times at Wina Holiday Villa Hotel. It is totally affordable and excellent for  its  value. The location is super convenient too. It's within 3 minutes walk to Kuta beach area and Sheraton beach walk shopping mall.
"Location: The hotel is located very close to the Kuta beach, and close to the mall, so plenty of options for window shopping/food/surf boarding etc. Kuta is very touristy, if you prefer quieter cleaner neighborhood then opt for Nua Dusa or Ubud.
Value for money: I got good value for my money, the staff were courteous and helpful, and the rooms were clean and tidy.
Improvement areas: Bathroom fixtures need an upgrade, they are old. Plus the shower know dont seem to work, there wasnt an easy way to control hot water, you either get full on hot water or super cold."
"I have stayed at Wina 5 during of my 6 Bali holidays. I return to Wina year after uear as I know what to expect. To be fair, the entire cou try is trying to 'come back' post COVID, but I feel there was more that could have been done to make all guests stays more enjoyable. 
The rear section of the hotel where the swim-up pool is located, is no longer being used. There is talk that this area will be removed from Wina's management and repurchased as Villa's. If this happens the back access gate may not be available for Wina guests to use in the future.
The Buffet breakfast was only provided for the holidaying Indonesian guests, although the other guests were 'allowed' to eat it, I personally felt like it was the staff's intent to discourage Western diners.
I was also displeased to book and pay for a Deluxe Pool Access room, but they tried to give me a Superior room. If I had not been here before I would not have known the difference. I certainly didn't let them get away with that!"
"Great location near Kuta Beach and Beachwalk Mall with free parking. The room is old (the fotos while booking doesnot represent the quality of the room), water in the shower is salty (sea water?), cleanliness need to be optimized. 
Since I got this room for a quite cheap rate, I guess it’s okay. But I would not recommend this hotel to a friend."
"Pro :Nice swimming pool and breakfast, the hotel quiet old and near to the beach. Close to Beachwalk mall. Happening area
Cons : The toilet blockage, but been rectify by the staff."
"Breakfast was superb
Room was  just fine . Staff was very helpfull.
The suroundings was superb"
"This place is at the hart of Kuta. Near the beach and near the party zone. And that's about where it ends. This place is in no way a 4 Star Resort, I would give it maybe a 2.5 star rating. The room we received was tiny, the bathroom even tinier with the door barely clearing the sink. The bathtub was gross and rusted with brown and broken grout. No hot water in the evening or the morning. The bed was as hard as a board which made me wake up with a huge backache. Only the pillows were decent. International TV programs were good. Plenty of outlets. Woke up on Sunday morning at 7 with loud bulldozer noises next to our room from the mega stracture being built next door. The breakfast bar was decent but not special. Pool area looked well kept but our overall impression of this place was VERY dated. Would not return at any price."
clean and comfortable
Value for money and excellent location.
"For short distance stay, not for longer. Very strange that they ask for 500k deposit, never hppened to me in other hotels. The rooms are basic, need some renorvation. Its ok but not the best one."
Bad traffic in Kuta
Unfortunately I got the old room and smelly washroom. Wifi facility is not very strong to surf Internet in the room. The door is very small and cannot close neatly. However the advantages of this hotel is it located near the  famous beach and shopping complex ~ just within walking distaince
"Not much to offer at breakfast. There were no  options at all for westerners outside of eggs or cereal. I was there 8 days and the menu did not change. Cut fruit was available but it was hot, it needed to be chilled. No bacon at all, after the 4th day I asked, they said yes and cooked me up something that looked like spam. Maybe its the time of year as Bali was quiet but this turned me off coming back. I've had more options for breakfast at smaller and more inexpensive places. I look forward to my cooked buffet breakfasts for 8 days a few times a year."
"Value for money, excellent location."
"I mean, seriously, this might have been a great place in some other times, but now it has lost its old glory and remains old, shabby establishment. It's ok but what I'm bothered about is they are presenting and selling ""super de lux something"" rooms and that is far from the truth.  If even ""super de lux"" rooms are in bad condition, I can't imagine what the ""ordinary"" rooms look like.  Location is really great if you want to be in the heart of the crowd. It always depends on what kind of tourist you are and what are your needs and preferences."
I have been here for 3days but the maintenance is not good and cleaning is slightly better.you can get only salt water for bathing. it's half ton AC and not sufficient in summer and no fans provided.better not to take ground floor rooms due to mosquitos.this hotel is good as per location easy accessibility to beach and for shopping.when i was there intercom was not working and lift is also not working.
"Low water pressure & no hot water
Things in d hotel is old 
Staff Service is good and friendly"
Everything is old on this hotel. Rusted. Location is great and price is cheap. But could use some touch up
"Traffic to reach
Week wifi
Not offered room booked alleging unavailability
Repetitive breakfast
Overpriced re similar hotel staring"
"Very bad, the wifi is not working. The floor is very dirty, lif also not function. We have to walk all the way to level 3."
The bathroom is clogged.phone problem so once need them need go to lobby.pump flush toilet slow.
"This place is rundown ,the rooms have dirty mouldy bathrooms ,dusty furniture ,towels are grey ,no face washers provided ,dark rooms the best thing would be the newer pool"
"The Hotel looks great in photos but the toilet  plumbing, water pressure in shower is pathetic. Two English tv channels, no cable channels. A very long walk down a lane to the main road.
There are better Much cheaper Hotels with much better amenities. Oh, extremely ancient Tv unit, stairs are extremely steep.
Don’t even consider staying here"
"The hotel itself is needing a lot of attention!
- decor is Tired & extremely outdated.
-It rained very heavy on 1 nights, causing the toilets to back up.
-The bed was as hard as concrete.
-Buffet Breakfast had limited choices and was not worth the expense. The A la carte  restaurant was the same “Pricey & Pathetic”
-The pools were very dirty
-Poor internet connection
On the first night, the cupboard kept rattling, we called reception.. We had a rat and not the small kind (the size of a possum or full grown cat) running through our walls/roof causing the cupboard to shake - They didn’t catch it for 2 days until they placed large traps in the roof cavity.
We did ask to switch rooms but were shown 3 others 
- 1 had a heap of dead roaches and quite a few live ones (the attendant said “no worry, no worry we clean before you move 😳)
- 1 smelled of raw sewerage and we chose to leave very quickly
- 1 had a swarm of mosquitoes 🦟 
... we chose to stay put with the rat in the walls."
"Completely rusty property with no service.
Intercom not working, all lifts were off with excuse all under maintenance, rusty locks which even not working and washroom is even complete mess.
No towels were given, No toiletries were given.
Complete wastage of money."
"It was actually my 2nd stay at Wina Holiday Villa Hotel.
I would say I had perfect stay again this time owing to the attentive, friendly and most dedicated staffs. After my friends and I went tracking, 
we had my shoes laundered at the hotel.
Our shoes came back almost like a brand new shoes
 and we only paid 3 bucks each for the cleaning!
When me and my friends had to get picked up as early 6 am for our outdoor activities in Bali, hotel staffs packed our breakfast for us so we did not have to miss breakfast. 
I have also had the chance to try out the massage at the hotel this
 time which was totally relaxing and worth the money. 
I love the hotel for it's strategic location which is within 2 minutes walking distant to kuta beach but somehow situated in this quiet area compared to other local villas or hotels. I am looking forward to stay at Wina Holiday Villa Hotel again during my next visit in Bali."
"wina holiday villa hotel is conveniently located at the end of jalan pantai kuta which is right where kuta beach is. a short walk to shops restaurants, mall, clubs in kuta square and legian, hardrock cafe, starbucks, jalan poppies lane 1 and jalan poppies lane 2. cross the road and you are on kuta beach. the hotel has a nice size pool and a very decent breakfast. rooms are clean and comfortable. hotel staff are efficient & friendly."
"Very popular Hotel, close to everything from the beach to the market stalls to the glass front shops...Staff were very friendly & always at hand...My room was excellent as I was upgraded to Deluxe room overlooking the main pool, food at the restaurant was good & reasonably cheap...Breakfast was excellent with everything you could imagine, amenities were clean & the atmosphere was always buzzing...Seems to be very popular with the younger crowds, the back part of the resort seemed to host the majority of the young crowd, whislt the front pool area & rooms seemed to be occupied by the familys & the older crowd...All in all a nice couple of days staying at the Wina Holiday Villa in Kuta."
"The hotel located only 5 minutes walk from Kuta Beach and Kuta Beach Walk (Mall) where you can easily find good foods. Wina Holiday Villa is an International chain hotel which provide comfortable room with good price. The room is well completed with hot water.

Breakfast menu completed from Appetizer to Desserts and there is Halal Certificate on the Buffet desk. 

I would definitely come back to this hotel."
The Wina Holiday Villa Hotel should be a 4-star hotel.  It is situated off the road - nice and quiet - but only a 5 minute walk to the beach.  The hotel provides a free shuttle service with the party shopping boundary.  This is the perfect place to relax and make your home base!  Everything is large and clean.  The pool is right in front of the restaurant which has great tasting food at an excellent price.  The mall is to the left when you hit the main road.  I'm thinking of coming here for 30 days every year due price and the factors mentioned above.
"I stayed with my family consists of 6 adults and three kids for four days and three night at Wina Holiday Villa  Bali. This was my third times came to Bali and first time stayed at this hotel. We found that the hotel was so nice and convenience, just 100 meter from the famous Kuta beach, our rooms just near the lobby and the restaurant for breakfast. Finally I got my chance to go for a jog in the morning at the beach.Sweet memory for my families staying at this hotel."
"We stayed from 20dec to 26dec in room 152 & 153. It is a nice (probably less than 3mins) walk down the alley from the main street to the hotel or hotel to the beach. Location of our  room was ground floor and pool facing so it is really easy and great for our 3 little kids to jump into the pool. The room was simple and clean. Dont expect a 5* carpeted hotel room. This hotel reminds us of the old kuta some 15 to 20years back when we were in bali during our teens. Back then, this kinda room was considered a luxury. Well, not for fussy travellers. 
We had an issue on the 1st night after checking in. The air-condition  wasn’t working even after we left it on for 4hours. Called the reception and immediately the maintenance guy was sent over to fix it. But a while later, it was just cool air and we couldn’t sleep well that night. The reception was kind enough to upgrade us to a deluxe room but we rejected the offer as we love the room location we were in. So, they sent another maintenance guy again the next morning who took his time to check our rooms and managed to fix the aircon which works well till the end of our stay. 
Hotel breakfast was HALAL and just nice to fill up the empty tummy in the morning. Love that they have the egg counter so you can request how you want your eggs to be. Breakfast menu changed daily though. We definitely give a 2 thumbs up to their ala carte room service. The black pepper steak was nicely done. Fish and chips plus their chicken wings was awesome too (Minus the tax of cos). Staffs from the reception to the housekeeping to the night security guards who walked around a few times after midnight were all  so friendly and warm. 
We would definitely make a come back and stay at Wina."
"We are family with two small children. My husband is local (sumatran) and we have been living in Bali few years back and now that we stay permanent at my home country we still visit Bali almost every year. We have been staying at Wina earlier and we will defenately stay also in the future!
Rooms are clean (currently under reno), all the pool areas are also very clean and they have pools for kids too. Staff is always more than friendly and helpful, they genuinly  try to help and fulfil all their customers wishes and needs.  When we stay here we feel like home. Location is also the best possible. Near to the beach and mall (beachwalk) but still a little bit aside, so thet at the night time it's really quiet and peaceful. There's no other hotel in Kuta I could recommend this strongly for families with small kids and I can say that I have seen the hotel supply in Kuta. Strong recommendation for this hotel from our family!"
"Although it is mentioned to be at Jalan Raya Pantai Kuta, but actually the location is entering a small pathway... only just 100 m... no big deal.. So, we can walk to the beach and the Beachwalk Mall to have meals and enjoying our time.
A Lovely hotel with a very attentive and friendly staff. I really love how they offered us some takeaway breakfast since we have to leave at 3am in the morning heading to Lovina for our trip. That was awesome..!! Without asking, they really know what their guests needed.
The room was huge and clean, the shower pressure are good... The AC working very well..
The breakfast also tasty, maybe not many variance, but all are tasty and you will have your tummy filled up nicely before you go for your tour activity....
Thanks Wina Holiday Hotel.."
"We just returned from Wina Holiday Villa Hotel ,5 day trip in Bali Indonesia. The Hotel location was perfect , the beach was only a 100 meters away from the hotel and the most happening streets were only 10 minutes away. After our sightsseeings , upon arriving at our hotel , we are always greeted by smiles from the workers. The hotel is peaceful , relaxing and quiet. There are 2 huge swimming pools where we find serenity after a long day under the sun dragging our sore feet. definetely value for money! you wont regret staying at Wina Holiday Villa Hotel!"
"This was my 2nd stay at the Wina holiday Villa I will stay there next time I'm in Bali, it's close to the beach,shopping, nightlife, the staff are very helpful they all speak some English so language was never a problem they go out of there way to help you in any way they can, I would recommend Wina Holiday Villa to all my friends and family."
"This is the 2nd time I have stayed at the Wina Holiday Villa Hotel, both times i have not been disappointed. The staff are friendly and the rooms are good.  Currently upgrading and renovating, the newly renovated rooms are beautiful and I want to stay in one upon my return in February. Breakfast is good. Would recommend if you want an authentic bali hotel."
"This was my second visit to Bali and also my second stay at Wina Holiday Villa. Glad to say that the quality of room and service provided remained excellent. The room was clean and spacious. Besides that, hotel staff were also polite and hospitable. I would definitely come back."
"Our stay at Wina was fantastic, we have stayed in other hotels in kuta over the last 7 visits but have finally found one that suites our needs perfectly, from the moment we arrived until the time we left we where very happy with the service of the staff and the facilities provided at the hotel, the breakfast was excellent with more than enough to choose from, the room was neat and cleaned well every day, the bathroom was large and recently renovated. the location for us is just perfect only a stroll to the beach and a very central location for all the attractions in Kuta, the rear entrance is very handy to get to all the restaurant's  and action in the laneways. Looking forward to our next stay at the Wina."
"Wina Holiday Villa Hotel is very nice. Close to beach and shopping, nice gardens. Staff were very friendly. Clean and tidy rooms. Wifi a bit slow here but this was ok. Breakfast was ok, but we are not big breakfast people. A good choice of hotel for location and getting around. Would return"
"My stay at Wina Hotel overall was very satisfying. Though its location is a bit deep from the main street of Kuta, but it's not a problem for young people like me and my friends. I can say that Wina is strategically located in the middle of Kuta, where the shops are just a few minutes walk from Wina, you can definitely find affordable nice food, outdoor activities and shopping. Will definitely be back to Wina Hotel if i'm goin Bali again."
"It was a pleasant stay at Wina Holiday Villa. The hotel has a perfect artistic Balinese touch which I was so in love with. The best part is, Kuta beach is just less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel. But the only thing which was lacking is the food served which in my opinion are tasteless and lack of variety. They can't even differentiate between half boiled egg and hard boiled. I wish they can improve and have some varieties on their menu. They should also aware if the food in the container is empty and don't wait until the guest told them so. If the food and service is improved, I will be happy to rate them as 5 stars."
"We absolutely loved it we actually stayed for 1 month. I thought this may have been to long but it was not long enough.
On arrival we were taken to our rooms within 10 mins.I took my parents and we had requested overlooking the pool, ground floor near reception for them, well they got ground floor overlooking pool next door to reception. We requested ground floor overlooking pool or gardens, we got the gardens and couldn't of been happier.
Our Air conditioner didn't seem to be working so I told reception it was re gassed within 20 mins (very impressed).
Room service was so quick, restaurant was lovely also .
The security was also excellent if people were loud or not doing the right thing they were dealt with in a very professional manner.
We normally stay at the Adi Dharma which is great also but my husband Surfs so the Wina is closer to the beach because even though they are next door you have to walk right around but the Wina you walk out the main entrance and down the lane and you are on Kuta Beach.You also have the back door which leads you up a very special little Lane were we get a lot of our shopping excellent money exchanger little shop were we get our water from. 
If you go out the main entrance down the lane turn left (walking) a couple of minutes you will find the Beach walk go in the first entrance stay to your left find the esculators to the ground floor there you will find an amazing supermarket that has a bakery, deli, fruit and veg/salads, dairy and groceries on the same floor is a great pharmacy.
We will  return and stay I cant wait counting the days."
"we booked a superior room at wina holiday villa hotel for two nights through agoda. on our second night, we were upgraded into a suite. so we decided to book for another night and got the same room for the price of a superior room. 

the rooms are spacious and clean especially the suite. room rates include a buffet breakfast and a welcome drink. they also have a money changer in the lobby. wifi is available any where int the hotel.

we will surely be back in this hotel for our next visit to bali.."
"Wina Holiday Villas is one i would most definately stay at again and recomment to friends. The location is fantastic as all major attractions are close by. The traditional 'bali' look and feel of the hotel is really nice. Both pools were fantastic. We ate at the restaraunt many times and always enjoyed. Buffet breakfast was a big win.

The rooms were tidy and had everything you need, aircons worked very well.

Gym is handy too, for those who like to venture in their on holidays."
The wina holiday was great for its value of money . Very cheap but it comes with hotel rooms that need a lot of work and poor cleaning . Need a good renovation and mould cleaning and also motors in bathroom falling apart . Attention to detail could impact their customer’s satisfaction
The place is amazing quite and the pool was amazing
"1. Not suitable for family with kids
2. The room corridor is too narrow
I would recommend this hotel only to those who just need a place to sleep"
The best
Good place with a nice pool
The water in the bathroom is very salty. The ants are found in the room. Mosquitoes can come in the room if the door is opened. The refrigerator is not cold. I was afraid that the refrigerator was going to be fire any time because it was so hot. The pool view room only can view another hotel pool.
Minus horrible loud noise in 108 all night long
"We had no water pressure most days.  Reported and said would check but nothing changed.  Nothing worse than trying to have a shower and no water.    If you like rock hard beds, then you will love the beds at Wina.  Like sleeping on stone.  We ended up moving to a different hotel as we couldn't put up with not being able to have a shower."
Verry good
"Great place to stay !
Will diffently be coming back"
will repeat again
"Staffs are nice, rooms are clean, aircon cool,  near beach location, everything's fine. Only the breakfast, menus are same everyday. Overall, 🆗 👍"
My kids were wondering some smart Tv at room but they don’t have swimming pools was very clean though
"Not as per photos uploaded by wina villa,"
"We booked this hotel after going through lot of positive reviews and as it’s near to the beach, but it’s a horrible experience to stay in this hotel, 
hotel is very old and have some nice features but it’s not at all comfortable to stay.  
Room is filthy Just to give an example my hostel rooms and toilets are much cleaner than this, if you booked, please make sure you carry the Fan ( as AC is horrible) and get ready to share ur bed with bugs :)"
"Clean Room
Superb Staff
Best Location
Best Free Buffet"
Staff very helpful and pool was lovely room was great too!
"It’s very old not seems like renovated.I don’t prefer for family try to avoid booking with family.you cannot make coffee they are kettle were rusted .  
Think before you book"
Not good
"2 min to main shopping.
100 meters to the beach down a private driveway.
Pool very clean and refreshing.
Staff extreamly friendly.
I'm staying there all the time now. 100%"
"Aircon wasn't working so the technician had to add Freon but it still wasn't working. We were moved to another room. The room isn't very clean. When we need things like towels, we had to call the reception a few times to follow up."
"Good quiet location, 1 min walk from Kuta beach"
This was my sixth vist to the hotel so that in itself speaks for how I found the experience! Like many hotels in Bali Wina Holiday Villa was closed for 3 years and only opened again in January 2023 so it was just getting going again during our vist. The only complaint I have is the quality of the breakfast when it comes to coffee and tea. The machine does not deliver nice tasting coffee and the tea was far too weak. I noticed that many guests must have thought so as well since they brought their own coffee and tea bags with them to breakfast.
Always consider the Wina holiday villa great place good facilities staff friendly and happy
"The staff is extremely rude.
When we reached the hotel, they gave the completely wrong room to what I booked online. The staff showed us similar rooms with low prices whereas the one I booked was a better looking one with a more excellent view.
Finally, We got a similar room to what I booked.
Although it was a staff mistake, the lady at the counter was very unapologetic and did not bother to say sorry once."
Breakfast was very boring . More Asian food than Aussie
"Tourist trap! Looks cool because of the traditional atmosphere and two swimming pools. But my room was dirty, smelly and mouldy. The bathroom not in good shape. We had to keep asking for essentials as toilet paper. One night was raining like crazy so we asked for an umbrella to go and walk, they said only he 1 umbrella for the whole hotel, then we decided to have dinner in the hotel’s restaurant, they didn’t have any food available options. 
Not returning to this hotel or recommending it."
Goof
GOOD
"near to city centre, but very quiet n serene.."
"very bad experience... location is ok... staff are good... but A/C was the biggest problem with the hotel, even they charge my room after complain but still the same. My bad luck I didn’t check the review before chick-in... my advice is to think twice before booking."
Closeness of pool to rooms
This hotel is very Balinese and has a wonderful atmosphere. Staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. I love you all!
Everything was lovely location near to beach and busy kuta area and at the same time tucked away from the noise. Food at the restaurant was excellent highly recommended 😊
"1 PowerPoint in room that you could use which was located in the bathroom. Beds are hard, fridge had to be replaced after tell the staff for 2 days that it wasn't cold, aircon was a waste of time as it didnt keep the room cool as it was located to high in the room. Toilet blocked and overflowed, curtains are not block out so as soon as the sun came up you where up, just a real crappy holiday at a crappy hotel. Pool area nice but not sure why they have swim up bars in 2 of the pools when no one works in them during the day. Why would you have 3 different happy hour prices depending which pool you are at and why would you close the pool at 8pm"
"Well priced, great staff, lots of pools and overall a great experience! Would definitely recommend for families!"
"Excellent location,close to everything,Room not very clean ,shower worked sometimes ,shower would run either hot or cold and just dribble out ,toilet would flush sometimes ,had to keep fixing it to make it flush.Everything old ,in desperate need of a huge makeover ,Staff some were very nice others just not helpful at all.Hotel okay if you like just the basics.A plus they have 3 big pools"
Only complain is the pool closes at 9.
nice location
"I love everything about this hotel and strongly recommend to stay here as long as you are not looking for Sheraton or Hilton level of residency. Its value of money is so amazing and I love here. but sometimes a few of staffs can make you in trouble. They changed my safe number without my permission even though I asked for late check out. while they said it could have been their house keepers fault but that day they didn’t even clean the room. Just changed my password number and that made me wait longer than 20 minutes so that I could have lost my plane... the other say, gojeck driver dropped me at the locked back door gate and told the employee to open the door at night. I waited for about 20 minutes in the dark at night... and some of those can go on... But!!!! Still I love staying in this beautiful cottage and wish to stay in the future. the reason I share these problems is I hope them to correct those few minor problems making me ruining a holiday which could have been PERFECT...."
old bedroom feels like it has  not been repaired or painted for years. not worth the money spent
"Good location, wellkept. Room old but clean. Comfortable bed. Bad, bad wifi"
"Bathrooms were gross. Linen was not very clean, NO pool bar??? At all stayed a week and not once did they open the pool bar. No table service by the pool either. Chasing staff half the time for a very over priced drink. No happy hour. 
Basic morning breakfast. 
Just not the best place I’ve stayed lucky most the staff were friendly and made up for the poor facilities"
"Pro - location opposite the beach, sort of cheap. 
Cons - bad breakfast, no pool bar at all, expensive drinks, no happy hour drinks, minimal hot water in the showers, power outages, dirty bathrooms.
For the price you pay it should be much nicer. Also it’s always a fight for the pool lounge chairs."
Noisy hotel
I loved this place. this place has great hotel and look exactly same as the pictures. Very convenient to go to the beach and restaurants... and I loved this place especially as it’s near to my massage places. But be careful about the return when you use Go-ride because they tend to ride you suing short cut which is connected to back door of hotel. They closed the back door after 10:00PM. I would have had huge regret if I couldn’t have had this experiences. I’ll definitely come back for surfing and stay here.
"Close to everything.. 
Nice breakfast.. Nice staff..
Highly Recommended.."
good job Wina Holiday Villa..thanks for great hospitality since we check in until check out..keep it up dude..
Everything is ok..but need to upgrade room facilities..look too old.. Staff is ok.
"From check in to check out it it was bad. The room I booked could not be provided. This was an error from the hotel and could not be resolved onsite. 
On the 4th night out of a 6 night stay we experienced bed bugs. Over 90 bites. We checked out as it is an obvious health risk. No apology from hotel at all. 
When seeking a refund the manager said I planned it from the start. I've had to fight for 2 weeks for a refund(and got it finally) for checking out early. The WiFi doesn't work in the rooms. There is a construction site next door that is very noisy all day and into the evening. Although if you are Russian, love to smoke durries everywhere including at the boring breakfast buffet, the pool and outside every room whilst you are in town getting a tattoo this is your hotel. Bed bugs can't bite through the cling wrap on a fresh tatt. 
Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else and enjoy your holiday, not experience a nightmare."
"All 3 Pools were great very clean, pool bars 2 wernt open at all drinks came from main dining bar took ages for delivery. 
Had issues with first room not being anywhere up to 3* standard asked to be moved. Staff were more than helpful and also provided upgrade. 
They explained half hotel has been refurbished. New room was amazing staff were always on hand to make sure everything was perfect for me.
They went above and beyond. 
Will stay again buy be warned make sure u book above the superior rooms theres a reason they dont show the bath rooms ;)"
"I stayed in Wina because of family booked this hotel. Otherwise I would not even choose this hotel. You get what you pay for so don't expect any luxury.
Pros: big balcony (room nr 204), fast service. My sink was clogged and when I mentioned it to the front desk, they immediately send a plumber to fix it.
Cons: very thin walls, literally could follow the conversations of the room next door.
Airco leaks and bathroom smells, stains on blankets 
Fitness room is lousy 
Hot water is scarce so shower on times no one else would shower otherwise there's no hot water"
"Our room A/c not working properly, there are no hot shower. The bathroom has a strong sewage kind of smell. I am usually ok with sub par rooms but this one is just not acceptable. The only good about this hotel is the location that’s it."
Not Recomended at all ...blacklist hotel !!!
Excellent stay. The staff were all very professional and helpful. Good location and clean rooms. Swimming pools were great. Room service food and breakfast buffet was great.
