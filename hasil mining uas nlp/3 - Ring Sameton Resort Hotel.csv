"The hot full breakfast is free! The rooms are air conditioned and cleaned daily. Swimming in the pool is relaxing with the naturally warm water. The price cannot be beat.  There are lots of ocean-front restaurants to choose from just across the street. This hotel is set back from the road where there is natural foliage on both sides giving the hotel a real Bali feel. There are chickens, and even a mama pig with her piglets are nearby.  Take a taxi to larger beaches or for cliff-side hikes."
"I spent 4 days in this beautiful, peaceful  & confortable room. The environment surrounded by nature is really enjoyable. The pool is large and clean.  And most important  Putu &co  who runs the hotel are the most sweet and dedicated persons that you will find in the island. As a feminine solo traveler I feel very safe. See you soon 😘"
"Lady of staff was like a mother, super lovely and affectionate. 
Are you leaving without taking breakfast? Let me give you something quick! 
I ended up staying one more day because I got confused with dates but luckily, there was no problems on their end. Highly recommend!! And next to Pineda Colada bar!"
"Very nice spacious and clean rooms, good location with some restaurants nearby, staff are kind and helpful - helped us arrange a driver"
"I love the staff’s friendliness and dedication. The atmosphere and facilities are modern but very close and friendly to the nature, which is most recommended to those who are looking for a solitude, peace and serenity, balance between city and countryside. Plus, the breakfast is delicious and varied to fit different tastes."
Our stay at Ring Sameton was wonderful. The staff was so welcoming and the service was 5 star. Our room was cleaned well every single day and the hotel is quickly accessible to everything nearby. I would absolutely choose this place again in the future and recommend it to friends and family.
"The staff were extremely attentive, helpful and super friendly. They helped me when I had a bad stomach by providing me with medicine and giving me guava drinks. The hotel is clean, the grounds are beautiful and we fell in love with the pool. I would 100% recommend to stay here during your stay on the Nusa Penida island"
Big property. Rooms big comfortable and and staff was so nice and friendly ! Enjoyed our stay here.
"The staff at the front desk was super helpful, kind and funny - fell in love w those ladies, real sweethearts! The floors are kept extra clean as they wash them everyday. Our room was impeccable."
The place to stay in Nusa Penida. Near the best places with a lovely and kindness staff.Big rooms a lovely swimming pool and great breakfast. excellent value for money. Love it !!!
great location and great staff very good stay
Fabulous swimming pool and very clean and comfortable rooms.
"Very helpfull staff. Strategic location near to the beach and harbour. Cleanliness. Big room. Very recommended for solo or family.
Will come back again."
"I had the best stay here, the staff r nice and friendly and we’re able to checkin earlier than expected. The Room is super nice, they clean the room everyday and overall is very good. only 1 thing really bothered us is the cleanliness at the restaurant. It’s dirty and the breakfast r cold. There’s many restaurants nearby so I recommend to try the surrounding. Good location tho. Thanks"
Friendliest staff I have ever encountered. Lovely resort. Would highly recommend !
"We had a great time here with our 1 year old daughter.
The pool is the best on the island and the staff is extremely kind, they were super friendly and caring.
Would come back for sure.
Thank you!!"
"Good location, great room and good help"
"The staff was very friendly and helpfull. Lovely ladies, good English. We felt really welcome. Breakfast was good. Rooms were large. We would recommend this resort to Everyone looking for a stay in Nusa Penida"
"This hotel sits 10 minutes from the harbor where most speed boats arrive and is located perfectly for road trips to the major tourist sights on the island. Also, within 10 minute walking distance you'll find a beach ideal for snorkeling. The staff was super firnedly. No passport check required. At one time there was a problem with the WIFI, the staff let us use the data from her cell phone. That is outstanding service. The hotel is very quiet and offers spacious rooms. As for the cons, there is no fridge in the room and WIFI can be unrealiable at times. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel."
the staff was so friendly and very concerned with our safety. always ready to give a helping hand!
The rooms are spacious and clean. Unfortunately the TV didn’t work and there wasn’t  enough light around the entrance so it was uncomfortable when we walked around in the evening.
"We had such a nice time at Ring Sameton. Lovely staff, great pool and a really good nights sleep on comfy beds. Would definitely recommend!"
"Everything was very nice, specially the big spaces and the staff. WiFi was poor/unstable half of the time, at least in my room."
"Very good, nice buffet breakfast, very clean, nice and friendly staff. Laundry service is cheap. Good Aircon
Only downside was that the bathroom smelled like sewage after showers, etc."
"We stayed here for 3 nights and can definitely recommend this place. Very good located, just around 8 minutes away from the ferry and good restaurants and bars just across the street. The staff was super friendly and helpful and we were amazed by their nice communication and service!"
"The hotel is a bit far to walk.  There are a few insects, the sanitary equipment is a bit old, the service is good, not very comfortable.  Near beach restaurants"
"We traveled in the month of nov 2022 here is pros n cons 
Pros : 1) near to beach ,2)restaurants are near by 3)around 8km from ferry ⛴️ stop
4) feel good environment in backyard 
5)good bf menu
6)spacious rooms
7)good for couple 
8) common areas are neat and clean
9)worth for money if u want enjoy/stay in hotel 
Cons : 1)as we booked two wheeler to roam in nusapendia it hard to find the entrance even we used Google maps .
2) when we were there only one staff is available for all visitors it seems so we carried our laugage by our own"
"It was a great place to stay. The staff was unbelievable friendly. There is a restaurant just opposite the hotel with live bands every night. Make sure you take enough cash with you as we could find only 1 cash machine on the island that worked with foreign cards, that's about a 10min drive away. At the hotel you can pay by card but most other places not.  Very lovely swimmingpool we had for ourselves most of the time. We will definitely stay there again."
Recommended
"The price was a little high given the facilities and the type of room that we were given. With the same price, you could get a better hotel on Bali Island. However, this is also one of the cheapest hotels around Nusa Penida.  It was around 3km away from the jetty so it is accessible if you rent a bike. A few convenient shops and restaurants were within walking distance. The aircon wasn't functioning very well when we stayed. The air didn't turn cold quickly enough."
I stayed here for night during my recent two day one night trip to Nusa Penida. I am told this is the first hotel in Nusa Penida island. It gives a serene feeling to stay with lot of wild growth in the easte and comfortable spacious rooms. Very close to the sea. I would come back here for a longer stay soon.
"You must book a little bungalow, they are so nice, with 2 little patios, and lots of room. Breakfast was good, location was perfect, pool huge and relaxing, grounds beautiful. Rooms felt unused, dusty, cobwebs and bathroom needed a good scrub."
"Rooms were massive & decently priced. Good bathrooms with hot water, air con worked well, location near enough to shops, bars, places to rent mopeds etc."
Great staff
everything was so good except for the internet
"The room was not that clean and there was  a foul smell in the bathroom.  Could have been from the water.  I booked this place knowing I would just be using this as a place to lay my head after being out all day from excursions.  The pool was very nice as I seemed to be the only guest at the hotel (I was there during low season).  Because I was the only guest, one may think I would get special attention or any attention for that matter.  The staff wouldn't even look up or acknowledge me if they saw me.  It was odd as that's not the dismissive character the Balinese are known for.  
The hotel is right across the street from Coca Penida and Penida Colada, two beach restaurants that have good menus as well as live music sometimes.  I ate a lot of my dinners at both of those places.  For the price, I can overlook the cleanliness, sewer smell and the impolite staff but with some improvements this place could be a lot nicer!"
"We are happy during our stay in Ring Sameton, wanna stay in this hotel again  when  we back to Nusa Penida !"
"Excellent location villas very large ,good TV and very good hot shower large clean swimming pool
Very poor breakfast AC not very good but overall a great place to stay and would recommend"
The place is very good but it is very secluded and there is nothing to do there.
"Its classic hotel , when u come into it..its look creepy and the room was clean n the staff was friendly...
The food was ok...
The rest maybe the hotel need to upgrade the garden .. its will be perfect"
Very Nice location and staff
WIFI is not good and it is mentioned as buffet but as usual on with very limited options. We took a bungalow near pool. Only positive is room is big and calm area.
"The hotel is quite tired in feel, with rooms offering clean space with a good bed and pillows. 
The pool was lovely - the best part for us. The staff were kind and helpful.
Walking distance to a number of nice restaurants. No beach access nearby. Breakfast was minimum, but decent. Eggs on toast basically, with juice.
If you are looking for a decent place to sleep on a lower budget, this one works."
"The place we stayed in was clean and a large bungalow, it was comfy but would have been nice if things were plugged in and working before we arrived ie the fridge, TV ... I think it is a little overpriced for what we paid and breakfast was very basic.  The location is great to other eateries and shops so overall it was a good stay.  The staff didnt have a good english understanding which was a little frustrating on a couple of occasions."
toilet has bad smell
Outdated resort that needs a lot of upgrades.  Band music from a nearby bar played way over 1:00 am my first night! It was better the second night. The receptionist ladies were kind and helpful though.
"The ring Sameton Resort and Hotel in Nusa Penida is the perfect choice if you want to spend relaxing days in this magical island!
We stayed in this hotel for three days and we had the best welcome ever!
Staff is friendly and always smiling.
The place is near everything you may need: diving centers, restaurants, lounge bar where you can enjoy the wonderful sunset...
A special thank to Ucik for making us feel at home! She's been exceptional with us she also give an upgrade with the room!
We will certainly return again next year!
Thanks for everything😊"
"I am currently at the Ring Sameton,  where I have extended my stay from four to seven nights, as I'd suspected I might want to do.  So comfortable,  well-located, clean, and most of all, fantastic staff. The manager, Ucik, goes to great lengths to make sure every guest's needs and desires are met. Ucik sets the tone,  and the rest of the staff rises to that standard. The rooms are spotlessly cleaned, with new bed linens daily, and the grounds are immaculate. Be forewarned -  Internet can be slow, but I am told it is still about the best on the island. 
Breakfast is not a ""buffet"" - probably a misunderstanding of the term - and is limited, repetitive, and simply gets the job done, like most of their meals, but I had not expected better. If the hotel owner were to hire a really good,  creative chef,  this place would be flawless. I was delighted to find that he warungs and Penida Colada across the street, and the Gallery just up the road,  keep delicious meals and beverages in walking distance. 
There is a nice big swimming pool, and there are lots of comfy spots to hang out.  It's easy to either rent a motorbike or have Ucik arrange for a driver. And best of all, some of the nicest snorkeling is just across the road, from shore. Just be sure to go near high tide. I also dived with Nusa Penida Watersport, highly recommended and probably the best and safest on the island; they picked me up at hotel. 
In short,  I am very happy to have chosen to stay here!"
"Ring Sameton was the perfect choice for our recent trip to Nusa Penida.
Large, clean room, quiet at night, and very friendly staff.
The pool is great and there is a wealth of birdlife on the grounds, including Bali Starling.
'Very close to Toyapakeh ferry, and a minute away from the excellent Warung Pondok and it's delicious fresh fish."
"Avoid booking with Agoda. They cancelled my fully paid booking on a whim. I left stranded without place to stay because of them.
Ring Sameton - for me it was ideal location. 100 metres to Freediving school Freedive Nusa (highly recommended) and 200 m to Pure Dive Resort (highly recommended)
Stayed in two different accommodations. 
One is doubled bed room. Nice, clean, modestly equipped. No view to mention. Would benefit of some love in care in shower department. No fridge (for me it was a bummer)
Second one Bungalow. If your budget allows choose this one. Bigger, cleaner, nicer, newer. Safety box (actually both accomadations) and fridge (nice!!!!)
But most amazing was stuff in reception! They helped me so much, when Agoda screw me up.  Did what they can, to sort everything out and let me stay. Great people! Love them :)
So if you in the area stay there, you are in safe in caring hands, agoda or not."
"We throughly enjoyed our stay at ring sameton. While the facilities were above board, the friendly service was exceptional. My wife and I spent 3 days exploring the island by motorbike. After long days of hiking and navigating rough roads it was a comfort knowing we were coming back to a quality room and the care of an helpful staff. Reasonably fast internet found through most of the hotel was a pleasant surprise considering the remoteness of the area. The restaurant offers competent fare which is par for the course on Penida."
"I had business in Bali (Sanur) and extended by trip to Nusa Penida for a little diving and snorkeling. Found Ring Sameton Inn on Agoda and the reviews are quite accurate. The property is about 100m from world class snorkeling. There is only 12 (or 16) rooms, so the property is quiet. The room is very clean, one wall is a large glass sliding door overlooking some bushes and garden. 
There is a restaurant in the property but the food is so-so, though quiet adequate. Bring some snacks with you to eat in your room/during your stay as there is no grocery store close by."
"The location is perfect - just 10 minutes from the harbor with a beach literally opposite the hotel. The beach is great for snorkeling - go out at high tide so you can swim over the seaweed farms. Also check out the beach bar 'Penida Colada' for great food and drinks. The hotel staff were extremely friendly, addressing us by our first names as soon as we arrived. They organized transport and a day tour for us at fair prices. The food at the restaurant was delicious and very reasonably priced compared to Bali! There are even two Bali Starlings who like to frequent the grounds. The room was big with a large, very comfortable bed. We will be back!"
"We have mixed feelings about our stay at the Ring Sameton Inn. The place itself is great and the staff too (especially Ucik!). The breakfast is okay, kind of tasty but the choice in the buffet is very limited and repetitive. The pool is huge and has 3 levels of depths, which is great! They offer a cheap shuttle service from the airport for 50 000 rupees. 
The first room we got was not okay, the sliding doors that gave on the garden were kind of broken and could easily be broken into, there was a wide space on top of them. They were quick to change our room, which was appreciated.
However, the main concern we have is that our bed had bed bugs! They said those were not bed bugs, and they changed our room. However, with our experience, we're pretty sure that those were bed bugs. There were 9 bugs, all the same, on the sheets, under the mattress, under the pillow, everywhere... Once they changed our room (again), we saw that they had just changed the bed sheets afterward (without treating the mattress for bed bugs), even though we told them about the importance of handling this issue well.
We tried explaining to many staff members that this wasn't acceptable and that we should get compensated for this, but they never proceeded to giving us something in return, aside from changing our room.
Mixed feelings about this place... It's kind of great, but those bed bugs were a big no-no for us, especially the way they handled the problem (they didn't seem to care much)."
"If i can rate the staff as 15/10 i would because they are all really nice and helpful and does not seem to be expecting anything in return unlike other hotels ive been to. They assisted us with the things that we need until our last day. Dont expect too much on their menu, if theres one thing that this hotel needs, its the revamp of their menu. Other than that, they have a clean pool they serve alcholic drinks(cheap), room is big anr clean, bed is nice, you can ask them for laundry service and it seems everyone in nusa penida knows them lol! Would i go back here? Yes!"
"Maybe I should say only wifi on the island. Even if you stay at another accommodation you will want to come by the ring sameton inn to check emails, enjoy a nice meal, and maybe even go for a swim. If you stay here it's all at your fingertips. Very close to the good warungs and dive/snorkel place. Defiantly recommend splurging on this place."
"I feel that all locals in Nusa Penida were very kind, including the staffs in this hotel. There was a ceremony at the nearby Pura/temple, the staffs told us to go and lent us a traditional balinese dress. We also lost our room key and the manager didn‘t charge us for that. 
The room was very spacious, had a lot of space to put stuffs, but a bit weird that they didn’t provide toilet paper (just regular hand papers for toilet)."
"We enjoyed going to Nusa Penida which is just a 10 min long boat trip from Nusa Lembongan. We hire scooters for $50000RP a day at the wharf and enjoyed the cruising around the island for a day and a half.Ring Sameton was easy to find , clean and the staff were friendly. Being two females travelling we felt very safe every where we went on the island and at the hotel. They even tried to get our beer cold!!!!"
"Staff is very friendly and helpful. Room was really clean and have more facilities than that could be expected from a 2 star hotel. Spacious room with a comfortable bed. Large bathroom. Very calm environment. If you are planning to go around the Nusa Penida Island, contact the staff. They are pleased to help you without digging for your gold."
Best hotel ever!!! So helpful and kind stuff. The position is really good and the rooms is clean. I really recommend this hotel! We forgot our ipad when we went to gili from Nusa penida end they help us to get our iPad back. They are so friendly! And the breakfast was really good!
"We stayed here in a big group of seniors, middle aged and children of different ages! We all loved it!
All staf provided an excellent service, the best we experienced during our round trip on Bali. An amazing place to stay on Penida which I will give my highest recommendations!"
"Could watch near extinct Bali Starlings in the hotel gardens. Inexpensive motor scooter hire made it easy to get around Nusa Penida island. Large, warm pool. friendly staff..."
"Loved staying here! The staff make you feel like this property are you’re home away from home , the rooms are older and a bit out dated but clean and beds are comfortable. The surrounding is rural on the island but very relaxing , the pool area very large but nice for relaxing , the food is ok at breakfast , limited choice , great restaurant/bars across the road , especially “penida colada, which has amazing food and drink choices, I stayed there one day for 8 hrs eating and drinking on a bean bag , was a very relaxing day... all in all an amazing place to stay and I would definitely stay again"
"I highly appreciate help and support from manager - Uchi and staff - Kadek. All was perfectly organized from airport pick up. They helped me with medicine, while i was sick. They helped with transportation arrangement to explore Nuca Penida island. Rooms just huge, European style of shower, hot water. Free Wi-Fi connection. Pool is a great deal, as during tide - there is no beach to relax, lay down and enjoy sunshine. Lovely breakfast (eggs, banana pancakes, fruits). Two bottles of water per day free of charge. Clean and quiet, the best place at Nuca Penida!"
"It´s not easy to find a nice place to stay on Nusa Penida as there are plenty of offers and not everyone is on agoda. If you don´t like to take the risk and look for your own you may be satified with this one. Friendly people, big pool, and if there is any problem the staff is really helpful. We had a few nights here and found out that there is a nice area around very close to the sea with some perfect places to have a cocktail."
"The staff at reception is extremely helpful in giving transfer guide for us. Arrange transfer to dive center and Toya Pakeh jetty. Room was big with all basic amenities except for fridge, so they allowed us to store our wine at Fridge at common area. Swimming pools was good and clean. Early morning can hear bird  and roaster calling you to wake up. Loaction is nice, very near to eating places. Highly recommend Penida Minag Restaurant and bar. Food is very much to Asean taste bugs, friendly boss and staffs, super band who can sing well."
"The staff were absolutely incredible and really made our stay here special. They organised a few trips for us and always helped when we had any questions. The room was basic but comfortable, had all we needed. Pool was lovely though we didn’t use it much. Breakfast was amazing - really tasty and a decent size! Just opposite the lovely Penida Colada restaurant so definitely head over there. 
This place suited our needs perfectly and we wouldn’t hesitate to book again."
"Everything was great; peaceful ,lovely grounds with pool,good value tour, great snorkelling across the road, delicious food and welcoming kind staff. We loved Nusa Penida."
"#Affordable
#Best location
#walkable distance from multiple cafes and #restaurants with live music
#Bakery shop near you
#Marts near you and lastly I would say the villa is one is biggest in size, my kid really enjoyed playing around inside and outdoors as well. Loved this place and would certainly want to visit again."
"AC is weak unfortunately.   Could be a fatal flaw for some travelers in hot seasons.  Breakfast substandard to be honest even for this level of hotel.  However, great location near dive shops and great restaurants all within short walk."
"Staff are friendly, big and clean room, swimming pool is clean enough. The staff were kind and helped me to find phone plug. Gooooood !"
"close to beach, near the road, may choices of restaurants and cafes"
Nice big villa in a quiet area close to Ubud! Very nice views on ricefields! A big compliment for Yuli for the nice breakfasts she served me.
"Hotel is quiet, nestled amongst the trees, giving it a secluded feel.  Has a nice pool, but no gym, hence the 4 star facility rating.  Rooms are very clean and large with two balconies."
Seems slightly overpriced.  Rooms are really good. But in overall there is a lack of maintenance.  At Night the resort gets really creepy. They should install more lamps.
"Room was very big, bottles of water and towels daily. I loved the swimming pool, best one I have seen in SE Asia so far. Great choice for breakfast. Great location with surrounding restaurants and bars. Only issue was big spiders and bugs in the room."
Everything is excellent except unavailability of fan as there is very hot.
Great staff and has everything you need. Communication about their service during Nyepi with food could’ve been better but they looked after everyone well so I’ve no complaints.
The hotel is located just at a 2 mins walking distance from a beach. The hotel rooms are spacious clean and with in the budget. A save place to book if ur travelling to nusa penida. The harbour is just 4 kms.The staff are the best. Overall it is best to place to crash in for stay at nusa penida
"Staff is wonderful , always courteous and smiling. Location nice with little restaurants and bars nearby, I recommend Next Level restaurant, family run , with Excellent fruit Bowls 👌🏽"
"Missing maintenance but we understand after pandemic crisis , missing to maintain the hotel properly . but recommande"
"Part of the beach is good with freediving and scuba diving shops, beach Café, supermarket, laundry shop around. Spacious room and good shower"
We were staying on Bali for three weeks and decided to go to Nusa Penida for three days. I went on Agoda's website and easily found this nice lodging there. The bungalows were roomy and very clean. The breakfast was nice. And the staff were the friendliest.
Everything went well
Staying here was awesome!! I have nothing to say!! ty ring sameton!!
Good location centrally and great staff and food.
The Bungalows are verry nice and the ladys at the reception too. They will helps you if you Need a driver or Tickets to get somewhere Else. Next to Hotel is the pure dive resort too .
Great walking distance from a really good healthy restaurant that has live music. The pool is nice and big and the rooms were decent for the price we paid. Don’t expect much for their breakfast though.
staff are super friendly and helpful. breakfast is excellent
"Our best stay at Bali. Really great, nice and friendly staff, across the street are good restaurants with life music. If I can something point out, than maybe breakfast can be better, or try to change it a bit..."
"Pros: good location, close to restaurants along the Main Street. Nice pool to chill. Huge rooms, great for divers with lots of dive gear. Value for money hotel.
Cons: The shower had uneven flooring and the water collected away from the drain, took forever to dry out and left a musty smell. Breakfast was buffet most days, simple enough fare. It was much better when there were less guests and we ordered off the menu."
"Ucki is a lovely host who will go out of her way to help you. She provided exceptional help to make our time on Pendia pleasurable. 
The breakfast changes daily giving a good variety. My son (7) was expecting French Toast (like the first morning), Ucki hear him asking, without hesitation she offer to have the chef make this up for him. A lovely thing to do, and we both appreciated it. 
The location was great. We were able to walk to nearby restaurants and cafes. 
Ucki was helpful organising a snorkeling trip and a driver to the ferry. 
We look forward to next year, when will will stay longer."
"Overall good value for money , friendly
Very nice large pool
Too bad Beds are outdated"
"Clean room with hair dryer, hot water to shower, full set of amenities, amazing swimming pool
Breakfast buffet with 04 options"
"Host is amazing, breakfast buffet is awesome and the room are enormous. No negative to say about this place."
"Nice rooms and staff were very friendly. Breakfast choices were limited but the food was good. Excellent location, was about 10 minutes to the harbour. Would stay here again if I was in Nusa Penida."
"Very good resort hotel, rooms are very clean, spacious, very good facilities, and great helpful staff. And it's very good for the money. It was a total of 5 comfortable nights."
Near a beach but not near other water sports activities. I might not stay there again in future
Its hard to find a resort in NP with reasonable price. I think this hotel do it best!
The television is not working in the room. Staff told us that they will come the next day but didn’t do it.
Top place in Nusa Penida
"+ big clean bungalowrooms with good bathroom, Nice pool, lovely staff, Nice Coral on beach to snorkel. Restaurants and bars in walking distance. Idem great dive center Blue divers."
"The location is perfect on the beach side cross the road and it just view min from the port. Traveling with your family, this is the best place to stay. Poll is nice, staff is very friendly. WiFi Connection is great . All good"
Staff are very friendly and helpful
Everything is perfect . The rooms are so clean and nice with the garden view . The surrounding area is green. It is like you are staying at a 4 stars resort . Love this place
Toilet shower is too low the pressure others is perfect
"Everything was perfect. The swimming pool was very clean, the breakfast was good for the value and our room was very big and beautiful.
It was my birthday and the staff helped my husband to pack the gifts and book a massage.
Very nice hotel."
"This place is newly renovated and the rooms are very clean/comfortable. The expansive landscape leads to a quite escape into a very well groomed property.
Very close to good diving operations and good restaurants. 
The staff was extremely kind, helpful, and accommodating. 
I’d highly recommend this place."
We were a group of three girls and the staff treated us like family. They went out their way to make sure our stay was extraordinary despite us being undesisive. They organized our snorkeling and tour of the island for us. The rooms were super clean and air conditioned. Honestly a great play to stay and would highly recommend to anyone going.
"The staff there really had mind service. 
The place was quiet, very nice for relaxation. 
The adult swimming pool was too deep, for us, 1.7 metre deep we believed. 
The breakfast was sort of local. 
Overall, we really enjoyed the stay."
"Only recommend this place if you upgrade to a bungalow, the relaxed rooms are dark and crappy , no frig. Nice oil. 
The bar across the street Penida Menida beach has great food and music"
The garden deluxe room upgrade was worth it for space.  Staff are fantastic.  Peneda Colada restaurant over the road is where to head for breakfast & drinks and dinner... as is the place to do the scuba diving for very little $ and surprising amounts of sea splendour to see.
This place was recommended to me so I booked it. Maybe a couple years ago this would be the best option but they need to update their facilities and clean it up a bit. Their is so much building going on and newer resorts that next time I would stay somewhere else. It wasn’t terrible but it certainly wasn’t memorable.
"Free water and breakfast 
Nice warm pool
Fresh towels water bottles coffee & tea in room each day
Very close to restaurants and day snorkeling spots!"
Great spot! Just the internet wasn’t working in our roon...
"The hotel was located not far from harbor. I think this hotel is old hotel, the shower head is rusty and the water didn't direct properly. I found a rusty tea spoon, so I'm not able to use it. The bathroom standard are cool, they have hairdryer which stick to the wall. The plugged in are too far from the desk or bedroom, the TV are too small compare to wide room, but I enjoy watching TV the most. The breakfast are amazing with buffet style, the pancake are delicious and that's my favorite here."
"Cons
- bedsheet was stained
- toilet smells bad
Pros
- near the beach
- staff loaned me the charger 
- swimming pool looks nice but I didn't swim"
location ok if u have bike
Hotel location is good surrounded by village life. Cafe and water activities shop nearby. Located away from the main part of the town along. Rooms are clean and spacious capable of having 4 guests in each room. Staff are friendly and helpful in arranging transport and requests. Recommended for those who want a quiet village setting.
"Great, funny people - very helpful and cordial."
"Breakfast wasn't great.
Worst wifi so far."
"Paid ~ 400 IDR for one night. Maybe you can argue that you get what you pay for, but the reality was quite different to pictures. Also interesting, it showed up first as 4 star while later we saw it as 3 star? No recommend"
Ganteng and I felt like we were staying with family
"Modern and clean hotel with spacious rooms, large pool and good breakfast. Not many restaurants or shops nearby, but perfect location for exploring the island by motorbike. Staff were friendly, only downside was the wifi which was intermittent at times."
"The location is about 100 metres from the beach & central to the main sights both east & west. We stayed in a bungalow & it was large, clean & had everything we needed. There was a breakfast buffet that was good. Didn't end up eating at the restaurant other than breakfast but the breakfast was always nice. There are good restaurants on the water within easy walking distance. The negative points are the safety deposit box is not attached to anything making it pointless to use as a thief can carry off the whole box. Also the transport to & from the harbour is expensive charging 100000IDR for a five minute drive. The pool has way too much chlorine. My skin was dry & smelt like chlorine for a full day after a five minute swim. Unfortunately though, most of the hotel pools we swam in were like that around bali."
"All of the staff were very friendly, helpful and accomodating. They upgraded our room and they always greet us with our name.  Hot shower, cable TV, and Wifi worked very well. Truly value for money"
"When we arrived, we had an issue with our booking. 
However, the staff made sure that everything was made right and we loved the last 3 nights of our holiday!
Thank you so much!
I recommend spending a little more and getting one of their bungalows. They are so nice and so spacious!
We enjoyed coming back to our room after a long day of adventure. 
You’ll do a lot of driving and coming back tired to such a nice room was such an amazing feeling. 
Thank you to the staff for making sure our holiday was top notch!"
Nice place to stay. Close of restaurants with nice view on the beach. Staff really nice. Good breakfast with choice.
"I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and would definitely go back. I booked the hotel due to the proximity and recommendation of a dive school, where I was taking lessons. I was pleasantly surprised. The ladies at the front desk were very welcoming and helpful. The room itself (I think I had a deluxe suite) was large , high ceilings, hot and cold water options without the salt water taste that I experience on Lembongan. There is multilingual tv channels so if you speak another language other than English you have options. Channel like HBO, National Geographic were my favourite. There is breakfast included but the restaurant doesn’t have a lunch option so you must go out for lunch. The pool was amazing and clean. There is a small pool for children attached to a larger deep pool for adult swimmers. If you are averse to home stays and prefer amenities and comforts that you are familiar with I would recommended this hotel. The pool alone is worth it when it’s too hot to go outside. The beach is literally across the street and you can snorkel but the coral is very close to the shore. Please do not destroy the coral if you choose to swim or snorkel."
"+ Really big room
+ Awesome pool area
+ Breakfast is a Buffet!
+ Employees are really helpful and give you good tour tipps.
- Water went cold when the neighbours used the shower to long. Wasnt really cool.
- WiFi didn't got a signal in the room. You need to go to the reception to get good internet connection.
The Breakfast was included. It's not a normal breakfast like in other hotels. It's Buffet! That's really good."
"We chose this location due to the proximity to our embassies. Not much around if you are looking to stay in the heart of KL, but only about a 10-15 mins walk to transit. It's a very comfy hotel (amazing pillows and beds) & breakfast buffet is amazing!"
Excellent location and wonderful warm staff that took great care of us
"The location is good and hotel itself is ok. The room was big but very basic, however good enough for the price we paid. Breakfast could be better."
EXCELLENT
Best Place to explore teh island
"staffs  are friendly and helpful. The bungalows is big , bed is comfy"
Food was very poor and there was nothing close so if you are the average traveler and not brining your car with you this is not the place to stay. Room was good but no facilities.
"Staff really pleasant,helpful and joyful.
The location is a bit far from the main must-sees but reachable by car,and the staff helped us to organize day trips.
The food is simple but good,and not overpriced.
Bungalows are quite spacious,the pool is lovely.
Close to a bar on the beach ideal for sunset drinks.
Higly recommended!"
"Hotel is clean and location is good. Staffs are friendly and speak English fluently. However, breakfast is served too slow that i had to wait for at least 30minutes for my sunny side up toast. After waiting for so long, they still got my order wrong and served omelette instead. I took it anyway cause i had to leave for my day tour."
"The room is large, the grounds are lovely and the breakfast is good. The standout, though was the service from reception and staff. Amicable, informative and helpful in assisting with tours, reservations, laundry, etc. 

A few restaurants and cafes are within walking distance."
"This was by far the best hotel we stayed in service wise, the owner of the hotel is a Gem. We messaged her late at night the night before our boat to the island to ask if she could help with transport, she replied almost immediately saying she had sorted it! From the moment we walked into the hotel she used our names and did so throughout the stay, we arrived at the island late and with only two days there we were panicking we wouldn't be able to fit everything in however she drew us up a plan of action for the same day we arrived and the following day to make sure we could fit it all in. Even though most drivers were booked mid day when we arrived she found a driver to take us around some amazing places and booked another for the following day for the others further away! 
On top of that I had cuts on my feet and no antiseptic cream with no shops on the island I asked for help and they jumped to the rescue with turmeric, something I've only ever cooked with!!! Amazing Stay Thank You!"
This hotel is really big but the personal make it feel like a home anyway. It was clean and had a nice pool and garden. Its close to nice foodplaces but it also has a restaurant.
"the reception staff was good. breakfast is buffet style but can be quite cold anytime after 8am. WiFi is terrible. there are always 5 or 6 locals sitting around in the lobby (the only place with any bit of signal) at evening time in their phones and laptops.  Good value for the money but for travel bloggers or people who need to access the internet, steer clear."
Great location. Friendly helpful staff. Great pool which we used daily
"This was a great getaway. The food is great, and the staff are more than accommodating. Unfortunately we stayed when it was a little cloudy but had it been sunshine all the way through we would have been thrilled. The rooms are nice and the pool area is beautiful. The staff helped us get a massage right in our own room, it was fantastic."
ok
Good hotel. Breakfast was poor but coffee good. The hostess was very helpful and gave us a map and where we should go too.  Location is good. Rooms very dated. But at the price I reckon its good value for money
"nice and very nice staff, we had some issues with some small animals otherwise everything was perfect.. recommend.."
"Nice facility, pretty good location on the island, friendly staff, very large rooms, A/C, but...
The place was nearly empty when I was there yet my room had no towels, toilet paper and the soap dispensers were empty.  I'm a single guy so not a huge deal but the room hadn't seen a thorough cleaning in ages.  Fortunately there was a small lizard in my room eating up the worms crawling around but the married couple next door lasted only one night due to this. The wifi almost never actually worked and while the dining staff was very friendly they were out of food and breakfast was beyond just cold.
It's a nice facility and the price is between where you don't want to stay and the nicest places around.  With a little effort it could be a great place.  It's too bad really."
"A wonderful place to stay in Lembongan. It's quiet, a couple of minutes walk to a fabulous beach where you can hire paddle. iCards and surfboards, great snorkelling, surf and close to a couple of really nice restaurants. Very helpful staff, spotless bungalows and gorgeous pool. 
Highly recommended :)"
"Friendly staff with clean, large rooms"
"Would recommend this accommodation but don't book through Agoda as they over charged me and won't repay me, worst customer service"
wasdnt able to go here actually
"Good Staff and location, enjoyed our stay"
"Pros: Ibu Ucik is very friendly  and helpful; very nice swimmingpool; good locaties on the is land
Contra: very poor breakfast"
"the place is nice and the hotel food is not so expensive either.  However, I hope they can improve the cleanness of the bed and some room has so many insects ( I don't know how they can go in since I never open the side door that connects to the garden ). But overall is good."
"Good rooms with a decent bathroom Great pool but breakfast was very average Same cold omelets ,cold  rice cold pancakes everyday. Better to find somewhere else to eat as food was expensive and not worth it. Don't  bother with the cocktails either Better elsewhere."
"warm welcome, helpful staff, good pool area"
"Great location close to safe swimming beach. Well kept gardens with many tropical flowering plants, free range chickens rustling in the leaf litter with the bonus of Bali starlings flitting amongst the branches every afternoon. A well maintained deep swimming pool is inviting, so too the generous sized outdoor pavilions to relax in. Staff couldn't be more helpful, friendly and welcoming. A place to remember and return to."
"I hesitate to tell people about this hidden gem, but the secret is getting out now, so I did want to thank the wonderful staff here.  Suci (the Manager) and the rest of the staff were genuinely wonderful, warm, and welcoming people.   My husband and I came for our honeymoon and we wish we would have spent our whole time here.  They were helpful with getting around the island, the food at the restaurant was great, the room was clean.  The whole experience was the highlight of our trip for sure."
"Good place to stay in Nusa Penida, quite strategic. The staff are very welcoming. Yet due to Nusa Penida environment, expect a bit of bugs."
"Good location, friendly staff and breakfast was nice as well."
Towels could be better and staff more attentive. No proper breakfast for 2 mornings of our stay. Otherwise staff friendly and pool is great.
"Pros: staff, good restaurant
Cons: bathroom often smelled of swet"
"This hotel is very nice and the manager was so helpful in arranging transport around for us. 
I wish smoking area was away from eating area."
"expecially Suci, the general manager is a very helpful and friendly person."
"Best place to explore this amazing island. You can rent a motorbike here, the Staff is really nice and helpful. Nearby you have some warungs, if you don't want to eat at the restaurant.
We extanded our stay and would come again."
I spent two nights here. Friendly staff. Clean room. Free wifi. Big swimming pool. Need to make pick-up arrangement as it is about 10-minute drive from Banjar Nyuh Harbour. To move around - ask the hotel to assist to get a guide or to rent a bike.
Quiet and friendly
"Me and my gf we love the swimming pool most, it was big and water is crystal, also quite warm around 30 degree, we play a long time. The staf is very nice, especially the owner Ucik she is always passionate and helpful , we had a nice stay. The only suggestion to Ucik is the towel is a bit old which makes it looks a bit dirty, it will be great to buy new one to replace."
Big guest room. Very clean. Very friendly staff...
Aircon was not cold. Very friendly staff and nice pool. Walking distance to penida colada and eateries
"big swimming pool, Wifi work best outside the room. Buffet breakfast."
Clean room and friendly staff. The breakfast was oke. Quite big swimming pool.
Great stay at the inn. Staff very friendly and if you needed to get anywhere. .manager would phone up and get you a price and get you transport if needed.. The pool was lovely for a daily dip.. and breakfast was very simple and enjoyable.. would  visit again.
So so quite
"Yes, would stay again. Simply lovely!"
"we had a pleasant stay here, definitely will recommend this hotel to our friends"
"Every positive review about this hotel is completely accurate, also the friendliness and the efficiency of the staff is highly praiseworthy!"
"Very, very pleasant and good value for sightseeing"
"Liverpool it, i would rekomendasi for antineoliberalisme looking to relasi away forum City life."
"Beautiful room, the pictures are completely accurate this time.  Staff couldn't have been more helpful, and arranged a great island tour for me.  I found the in-house menu simple but tasty and very reasonably priced.  Otherwise there are warungs across the road and stores 5 minutes walk away in Ped which can provide snacks (no diet soft drinks though)."
Really good. I'm a regular costumer and my experience is always perfect. The staff is always ready to help.
"Sitio muy tranquilo y limpio, todo perfecto, sin duda para repetir."
Cerca del hotel hay una ruta principal donde se encuentran varios restorentes que están todos enfrente a la playa. Tiene una pileta súper que se usa todo el día. El desayuno está correcto. Las habitaciones son súper grandes
"Si Vous êtes sur Nusa penida pour quelques jours cette hôtel est à un emplacement idéal. Dès place et beach club à proximité et plein de restaurant à proximité. Également pour le déplacement vers les attractions touristiques de l’île vous êtes à un bon endroit, soit au milieu au nord. Les déjeuner étaient bon, le service également, la piscine très belle et la propreté également, surtout considérant le prix. Un seul côté négatif, on entend la musique du bar l’autre côté d d’la rue jusqu’à tard le soir et ça part tôt le matin!"
"Très très grande piscine là meilleure que j ai faite 
Très bon emplacement 
Défaut sur la salle de bain c est bof bof"
Sans compter les punaises de lit et les cafard et le mauvais acceuil du personnel plusieurs arraignes dans la chambres noud ont fait fuire cet hotel en pleine soiree a fuire a fuire
"Super hôtel!
Nous avons séjourné en famille dans 2 bungalows attenants, très grand et très confortables avec un lit d'appoint.
Après 25 jours en Indonésie, c'est le premier hôtel qui coche toutes les cases (propre confortable, bien placé, restau et supérette à proximité).
Le petit déjeuner était varié et délicieux. Le meilleur depuis que je suis en Indonésie.
Le personnel est adorable, serviable. Ils ont organisés mon arrivée et départ de l'hôtel au port. Merci à Ardi pour son aide."
Personnel très accueillant et sympathique je recommande grandement
"Très propre et très bien situé.
Le personnel est fabuleux et a su nous aider pour à peu près tout.
Nous recommandons vivement."
"Une seule nuitée mais tout était vraiment nickel.
Merci agoda et merci ring sameton"
"Proche de tout et loin de rien, personnel très gentil et très efficace"
"Très reactits. Avons réservé 2h avant sont venus nous chercher au port de Topahayek pour 100k idr et nous ont ramenés pour 100k idr à  Samalan. Lautre port. Transferts payants. 
Tout est immense.  Le parc très fleuri et arboré : magnifique,  la piscine 15x7 m hors bassin enfants,  la chambre 50m2 hors salle d'eau et 2 terrasses (bungalows). 
Chambre très bien équipée et propre. Bonne literie sans plus. .  Salle de bain un peu vétuste et du tartre sur robinetterie.  Produits de soin au minimum. Pas de bonnets douche, de body lotion,  cotton tiges, coton...mais distributeur de savon et shampoing et brosse à.dents .un peu leger pour 4*.
Bon petit déjeuner pris sous forme d'un petit buffet chaud salé et sucré, spécialités locales salées, pan cake ou crêpes,  pain perdu, beignets fruits,  fruits frais,  jus d'orange pas génial,  boissons chaudes. 
C'est un très bon hotel entre les 2 ports donc très pratique.  Personnel adorable. Merci a Putu pour son accueil et sa réactivité. Recommadons"
"Vous allez avoir du mal a trouver mieux sur cette petite île ou le tourisme commence seulement a vraiment se développer.
Très belle et agréable piscine  ! Le bungalow était très spacieux et agréable, seul petit point négatif : la propreté. Je m""explique : taches sur les draps et essuies(serviettes), on sent a l'odeur  que c'est lavé mais qu'ils n'arrivent pas a retirer toutes les taches(ils ont beaucoup moins de moyens pour y parvenir).
La nourriture est également problématique mais en face de l’hôtel il y a pleins de petit restaurant bien sympa en bon !
Soyez prévenus : quand vous arrivez sur cette île avec un speedboat il n'y a pas de vrais port c'est une plage et donc quand c""est marée basse il faut aller a l""eau pour attendre la terre ferme !!!! Attention au pieds si vous y allez pieds nus c'est des petits morceaux de corail partout et donc très très douloureux !!"
Relay Nice hotel. The pool is amazing !
bungalow très spacieux nous y étions à 3 ! très propre. grande piscine. Juste en face de Penida Minang qui fait de très bons cocktails et d'excellents plats de poissons!  Et en face également de Octopus Dive avec qui nous sommes partis voir les raies mantas !
Le personel est adorable.L’hotel est très bien situé avec des restaurants tout près dont Penida Colada
