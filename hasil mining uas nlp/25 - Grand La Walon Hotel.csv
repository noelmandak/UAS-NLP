"Couldn’t have found a better place for the money we were willing to spend on accommodation.
Staff were all super helpful & welcoming. Rooms were clean and everything in working order.  Food at the restaurant was delicious & great prices. Buffet breakfast was perfect & their cocktail delicious and cheap.
We will be returning to Bali at some stage in the near future and will stay here again!!"
"We were really happy with our stay here.   The price makes it a great value.  The location is pretty decent too.  Obviously everything is a bit noisy in this part of town, but we got a room all the way at the back (asked for one) and enjoyed silence at night.  That and the wonderful blackout curtains made for some restful nights. 
The hotel is just a few minutes walk from the beach.  And, obviously, there are a zillion restaurants, convenience stores and shops nearby.
The pool looks decent, but we didn't use it."
"Stayed in a pool access room which is a decent size and well equipped. Nice size pool, comfortable bed and very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent location with everything you need close by"
"Excellent for price. Clean rooms, clean pool, close to food shopping amd nightlife. 10 minute walk to beach. 24 hour shop across the road. Friendly amd accomodating staff. I highly recommend for price and location"
"Very clean, comfortable hotel! Bed extremely comfortable with good pillows, lots of towels and bathroom toiletries , kettle and coffee/tea and fresh water daily. Pool is lovely and staff and very friendly and obliging. Good location, not far from beach and with plenty of eateries around. Only downside would be noise travels on the balconies and as the glass is not double glazed, can be a bit annoying when fellow guests talk loudly. But really excellent value for money, so much so I extended my stay for another couple of nights!"
"Smallish hotel. Centrally located walking distance to everything. 
Lovely staff from the cleaners, pool guys, reception and even the Manager who came to the pool to introduce himself - never seen this before. 
Would recommend for all. Maybe not families with lots of kids as only the central pool which can get noisy for other guests. 
Will be coming back again."
"Excellent location, close to restaurants, safe money changer (BMC), shopping, beaches, transportation and of coarse entertainment. The rooms were clean, spacious enough, quiet except for the roadside so avoid if possible, had all you need ie safe box, mini bar fridge which they are happy to empty if you just want to use as a fridge and best of all staff were awesome professional and extremely welcoming and friendly with the manager very attentive to all guests but made you feel you his only guest. Also excellent buffet breakfast, great value with great variety and yum and you can take your time and eat as little or as much as you like, again staff very professional, accommodating and friendly. Oh and the pool is also awesome never too crowded or full of kids and very refreshing. Overall an excellent stay, its not a 5 star luxury hotel, its better as its personal and full of the usual and beautiful Ballianese atmosphere and spirit. Definitely will stay again."
"Very good hotel of you want to stay in Kuta/Legian area you have everything you need like food,bars,circle k,indomaret. The beach is like 5 min walk from hotel. Room is very clean and staff are excellent!"
"I love staying at Grand La Walon
I feel like I’m coming home
The hotel is lovely and clean and the staff is awesome
I will always book here
5* to the manager Mr. yoman"
"Staff are very friendly,  house keeping leave your room lovely and clean. Hotel food is great. Pool is lovely and clean. Can't beat the location. Mini mart and laundry service across the road. This is the 2nd time staying here and I will be back on my next stay in Bali."
"Couldnt be happier that I chose this hotel in Kuta / legain .
Best move I did during this trip was change to this beautiful hotel 🏨"
I’ve stayed here 5 times now . It’s my go to place when I stay in the Kuta / Legian area . The staff are amazing ! And as an occasional solo traveller that is super important to me . The pool is great . Breakfast is great and the rooms clean and comfy :)
"Clean, comfortable and affordable. Staff welcoming, attentive and friendly. Great location and very safe
Ideal for any and all. First time staying, it will not be our last. Thank you Grand La Walon."
"We tried Legian area for the first time and absolutely loved this hotel and it’s location was great.
We had an upper street side room and was a tad noisy but didn’t stop us falling asleep, but that side got the morning and afternoon sun and only that side does. Which I loved, plus pool view from all rooms is a plus.. staff very helpful, booked another stay there in a few month pool access this time."
"I just spent the last 10 days staying here and it was fantastic! The rooms were clean, the staff were even better! 
100% recommend to stay here. 
Great hotel! 
Thanks Grand La Walon!"
"Location close beach,  shopping, restaurants.  Staff fantastic helpful, polite, hotel very clean , room cleaned daily and very well cleaned . The hotel has fantastic restaurants with large variety of food. 
Hotel can also arrange driver"
"Very clean hotel staff very friendly and honest
Great buffet menu would recommend!!!!"
A great hotel to stay Very clean  and hotel staff are friendly  and always there to make your stay a wonderful  experience   Highly recommend the Grand la walon Legian
"Grand la walan is an exceptional hotel. Fantastic location, great staff, amazing food at the restaurant, close to other great places to eat as well. Very clean. Pool is excellent. Highly recommend staying here"
"With the cheaper price of this hotel, we were a little worried about staying there but were so happy we did. 
The staff were so friendly and always helpful. The location is fantastic.  We were in a room around the back so there was little noise which suited us. 
We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
"This was our forth stay at this hotel. My husband and I love it. Highly recommend to any one who loves to stay in Legian area. The reception staff, cleaners, bar staff(in particular, Coco), pool staff, restaurant staff and of course the wonderful manager Nyoman always make our holiday a memorable one. We had a group booking of 18 family members and all had a great time. We were all accommodated  in the rooms requested at the rear of the complex."
"Cannot fault this hotel at all, except for checking out.Firstly, checking in process was fast and efficient, even though I arrived at the hotel early.
Room was big, spacious, and extremely clean. The bed was very big and comfortable, as was the bath, that suited my 6'3"" frame....LOL. Room was kept spotlessly clean every day, I simple cannot fault anything at all.
Breakfast had a good choice; I especially enjoyed the Balinese selection. Likewise, price of the meals in the restaurant, and the quality / quantity of food was excellent. So competitive that it kept me off of the main drags of Kuta when wanting to eat in the evening.
All staff were very friendly, kind and welcoming. They have a great team going there.
My only quibble with staff was on checking out. The guy that checked me out was suspicious that I may have had a couple of Bintangs from the mini bar. I mean, come on! I was celebrating my 53rd birthday, at my age I'm hardly going to rip off a hotel for the price of two beers!"
Best price and location.  Value for money. This is my 4th stay here and I’ll always chose this hotel.  Ask for a room at the back if you’re a light sleeper as road noise and clubs can get noisy.
"Myself and a friend grabbed 2 rooms last week.  We weren't sure what to expect for the price we paid, but were pleasantly  surprised with what was on offer.  It is not 5 star accomodation, but the rooms are clean, he staff are great, and the breakfast"
"Magnifiquè, staff beautiful"
Grand La Walon Hotel rooms were clean and fresh. The staff were amazing.
"We loved staying here, everything at your fingertips! Pool rooms a must’ so nice having a swim and ordering a drink and sitting at your room."
"Fabulous staff,  so attentive.  Pool access Room great,  very clean.  Pool great,  so clean and can get a lounge chair. Breaky fantastic,  great selection,  always fresh.  I can not wait to return."
"Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Great breakfast. Room to park my scooter in secure parking. Staff are very sweet. Nice central location, easy walk to the beach and shopping. Definitely would stay again.  Oh great wifi too."
"The staff were amazing, really warm and welcoming. The hotel is in an amazing location, located about 5 minutes from Poppies, 10 from Kuta and plenty of bars/cafes/restaurants around. The hotel manager is very welcoming and try’s to get to know you by name if you are around the pool! All in all such a great place to stay, would definitely stay here again."
"No complaints with hotel. The area is full of restaurants,  bars and shopping. Busy busy area."
Loved the place. Cold airconditioner. Good food. Access to massage. Nothing to much trouble. Staff always happy to chat. No pressure. Pool just right.
We were suggested to stay here by a friend and we weren’t disappointed.  Smallish hotel and we had a poolside room. Air con was lovely and cold and room had everything we needed - 1 hint - the shower doors do open outwards :) a very social place sitting around the pool. Staff were so friendly and very attentive - they really made our stay awesome! We will definitely be going back!
Super  impressed with the new hotel. Great value for money snd friendly staff
The hotel and the staff were lovely. Nice breakfast. Good location
Great for working by the pool.
Incredibly nice place to stay in what I consider the current heart of bali.
"Friendly staff/ great location and value for money, have already booked again"
"Stayed for a few months here last and this year, good rooms, good food, good location, any minor problems I had were sorted quickly and efficiently, only thing negative I can say is the wifi can be unstable and a bit hit and miss"
Perfect location and the staff were amazing
"This is a great value Hotel , the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Breakfast has a big variety of selection, the rooms are clean with a good design overlooking the pool area. The area is central to plenty of shops and restaurants. Highly recommended Hotel."
"Excellent service for staff very clean room cleaned very day pool area lovely n clean breakfast nice eat dinner there few times too & lots of bars restaurants nearby but laneway down to beach crazy with traffic
Would stay again & have recommended to others"
Great priced hotel in an awesome location. Staff are all beautiful & rooms lovely and clean. Oh and their banana splits are scrumptious 😋
The hotel is centrally located in Kuta near the airport. The staff was helpful. One of the best things about this hotel is the awesome breakfast!
"Pool rooms are so handy, just outside you find mini mart, money exchange, restaurants and shopping.  Bar is open and can order drinks and food easy as"
"Great value for money and central location. The rooms facing the main street gets traffic noise, not for the light sleeper."
Great Location . Great staff. Great management .Beautiful food. Would not stay anywhere else now
Very clean rooms .. great staff .. basic breakfast... not much sun on the pool so the waters very cold. Great budget hotel .. lots of restaurants close by 🍹🏖
"The hotel very beautiful and clean, good location , good breakfast, Nice staff.
I will be there again for sure.
Nadia,
Thailand"
"We stayed for 10 nights, great location for Kuta beach and restaurants/bars. Staff were very attentive and helpful. There’s a lot of mosquitos in the rooms, no matter how many you swat, somehow they get in."
"Fanatic hotel , very nice stuff , everything at hotel door step markets  Restaurants beach"
grandlawalon is a great  place to  stay Hotel is very clean  food is delicious  Staff are friendly  and always  have a smile
"Very affordable,  we find it a ideal location, shops,  lots of little places to eat or just sit around the pool and enjoy a binding or two.
The staff are just excellent"
Always enjoying staying at this hotel.  Staff most helpful.
"We stayed in the Delux pool room and were very happy with the quality of the room, the cleanliness and especially the very helpful staff. We stayed during the corona outbreak and the staff did their best to accommodate our travel re-arrangements. We would stay again without reservation."
"Nyoman and his staff are absolutely fantastic they make you feel like your at home.
This is a great hotel and you have everything at your doorstep, shopping restaurants and beach what more can you ask for.
Thank you Nyoman and your lovely staff for a fantastic stay, Rod and Jayne."
Nice hotel and nice place
Cozy and homey
Location is good and it is nearby to everything.
"Great hotel for budget conscious travellers. Great pool, restaurant and service. Very pleased that there is a lift to all floors. Great balcony overlooking the pool."
makanan enak kamar lumayan besar bersih & pengamanan di tingkatkan
"Great stay, close to everything, staff friendly and good price"
"Only fault , slight mildew smell.Although thats common through out asia."
"We stayed at the Grand La Nalon for 16 nights. Highlights of our stay were the wonderful friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us . Breakfast was nice and basic, buffet with an egg station. Nice clean room next to the pool. Location was good with several nice bars near by."
"Good location clean room Quite at night nice pool friendly staff 
i will stay here again"
Really enjoyed my stay there. Good job!
For its price this hotel is beyond expectations. Rooms clean and staff were nice and helpful. Breakfast buffet was decent. Central location close to kuta beach.
"Great place to stay with the virus happening staff always cleaning, rooms spot on, B/fast normal and food buy the pool was great and cheap
Would definitely stay again"
"Location of the hotel is really central. 2 minute walk onto Jalan Legain. Loads of eating places and shopping in the area. 8 minute walk to the beach. It's a budget hotel however the rooms are spacious with a balcony. Value for money. Staff are friendly, especially KOKO who provides excellent service."
Great staff
"Centrally located in Legian with a Mini Market across the road which is handy and walking distance to loads of bars and restaurants.  The room service food is really great and reasonably priced. Rooms are spacious with a balcony touch but rooms and bathroom could do with a thorough clean. We had 2 inter-connecting rooms and both were very dust, water in the bathrooms had a slight smell maybe those rooms weren't used for a while. Overall a good stay."
Close to restaurants accommodation nice and clean staff always smiling making you feel welcome
"4th time to Bali and this was the best trip out of the four. Relaxing, easy access to everything that we wanted. Would definitely stay here again."
"This restaurant provide nice buffet, is small the hotel, but was kept clean."
"Great hotel and location 
Staff very helpful"
"Still excellent for value hotel... right where u want to live...
Staff are very good and breaky was nice..."
This hotel is very central. Great value for money. Clean. Great staff
My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights recently and the facilities of the hotel and location was great. But sadly we felt a little uncomfortable there because most times especially at night when we would return to the room the person at reception
"Staff is a really nice.Hotel is a good location, so near beach and near main street."
"I stayed at the Grand La Walon Hotel for one-night April 16th-17th, 2022.  The last time I was in Bali in 2018 I had planned to stay there but didn't get a chance to.  I was excited to stay here because the price was great and the hotel was highly rated.  Great area near main road with lots of shops, restaurants, and massage places.  No issues with the check-in everything went smooth and they were able to get me a room before the check-in time which was greatly appreciated.  Room itself was nice and matched the picture that was shown on Agoda.  At first the room looked quite clean but on further examination it was not as clean as it should have been.  Slight stain on the sheets and the bed lamps were quite dirty.  Pool was very nice.  I think the main issue is staffing. I went down to the restaurant and there was no staff there.  I had to wait about 5 minutes before I asked if they were open.  Same thing happened when I checked out the following morning.  There was nobody at the front desk when I arrived.  I sat patiently for about 10 minutes before walking around looking for an employee.  I found someone in the restaurant and eventually an employee came down.  Overall a good stay.  As business bounces back they will need to address the staffing issues if they want to maintain their high recommendation levels.
Thank-you"
"Good hotel 
Friendly staff
Great location"
"Would recommend this hotel to friends.great location,nice and clean enough rooms,breakfast and rom service sufficient.staff were very friendly!!"
"Fully Recommend 
Great staff
Location"
"located right in the very crowded Legian street, traffic builds up easily, breakfast selection was the same daily, not much facilities other than pool but lots of restaurants by walking distance."
"Location is excellent for food, shopping and nightlife. Room are clean and spacious. Staff are very friendly amd accomodating. I would highly recommend this hotel for service location amd price"
"The room itself was fine and the staff were quite helpful. However if you are looking to sleep before 2am in the morning be warned! Many of the rooms in the hotel face the street and you will hear serious levels of noise from passing motorbikes ripping down the street, pedestrians, the hotel restaurant, and other bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel.  It was so bad that for three days  we had to leave the TV on to create sufficient white noise to sleep. On the final day we were moved to a quieter room (we requested on the night we arrived after experiencing the noise) which by and large was very quiet.  The sad thing is that the noise issue probably wouldn't be a huge issue if the window panes were double plated. Finally our experience of the restaurant food was that it was not up to standard with much of the cooking amateurish, overcooked and tasteless.  Finally, the location was not that great and we regret not being further south down Legian Rd."
"I stayed at this hotel for two nights five years ago and I had good memories here that I made a reservation for my first trip to Bali after COVID-19. I think the hotel facilities are too old and not managed at all. If the owner sees my review, make sure to renovate your hotel. The water stinks and the room smelled bad because of mold in the bathroom. There were small bugs in my bed so couldn't sleep at first night, so I moved to another room on the next day.
But staff are really kind and friendly."
Room 222 is a nightmare. The bathroon is smelly and no hotwater for shower. The frege noise drive me crazy and cant sleep The towels are old and looks dirty.
Loud music till 00:00
"We booked the Grand LA Walon simply on their facebook reviews, it was a very pleasant hotel that gave us everything we needed. The staff are a credit to the hotel including the female painters. 
Breakfast was basic but plentiful, you could eat as much as you like. The pool was very nice & always kept spotlessly clean. I had the pleasure of meeting the hotel manager who was doing a morning walk around the pool greeting his guests. The hotel house keepers (All male from what I see) did a splendid job, if I had 1 gripe, I would liked to have had an unstained loo seat 😬 The hotel is very central with everything on your door step from tattoo artists, massage parlours, restaurants & much much more, The beach is less than a 10 minute walk away, We hired 2 sunbeds for 2hrs for AU$5. Look out for 'Tony Marony' this guy is a legend & Ellie, who does the best foot massage ever. Would I stay here again? Definitely! & I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
(♡THANK YOU GRAND LA WALON♡)"
"All aspects of my one-week stay at the Grand La Walon Hotel, were exceptional. The staff and the manager of the hotel, Nyoman, were very welcoming and offered very good service. The Hotel is centrally located, with good access to shops, bars, restaurants, and is not too far from the beach. Additionally the property does not encounter excessive noise from any of the surrounding properties. The hotel itself, provides modern facilities with a nice swimming pool,restaurant and day spa which provides good services at reasonable prices. I stayed in the Grand Deluxe room, which was modern, had a nice large bathroom and a king size bed. I would recommend others to stay here, and I will stay here again in the future. Cheers!"
"I booked this hotel based on the reviews I’d read before travelling to Bali and it definitely lived up to its high rating. This hotel is clean, super friendly and in a great location. The staff are amazing and you can tell they really care about the guests and each other, it’s a lovely environment. 
The rooms are reasonably priced and when breakfast is included it’s definitely worth it, the food is great and lots of options. I loved the Grand La Walon so much I cancelled my other hotel to stay longer on my trip. 10/10 👌"
"Stayed here with a group for 5days the staff were amazing remembered all our names from day 1, one day I can egome to a bouquet of flowers in my room and a thank you card from them was lovely. The pool access room was great I also had a deluxe which was roomy and clean and the grand deluxe rooms ( I kept extending my stay that's why I had to change room) . Even went to another hotel for a few days that I had booked before I went to Bali and ended up leaving there and coming back to Grand La Walon. Security staff are lovely and the massages at the day spa were amazing also, loved the feel of this hotel me and my 7 other friends all agreed we would be back. I didn't make it to breakfast but had heaps off the room service menu and no complaints at all, walking distance to nightlife, 5mins walk from the beach also, Heaps of restaurants, warungs, taxis's and shopping at your door steep. Close enough tonight life to walk but far enough away it isn't noisy."
We had a wonderful stay at the Grand La Walon hotel in bali. Everything was explained on our arrival. Anything we needed was provided very quickly. We came back from dinner one night to find a lovely spray of flowers in our room thanking us for staying at the hotel. When we left the manager came out to thanks us for staying and waved goodbye. Plenty of pool chairs and towels - something that we have found lacking at other hotels. Breakfast was good and plenty of it. Will stay here again.
"We loved staying at the Grand la Walon. Great location,  we could walk to at lot of places. It is a very clean hotel. The staff are wonderful. Very friendly & helpful. Breakfast was yummy each day. And kids loved the food from room service.   This was our first trip to Bali & everyone was so nice. Even the drivers, the drivers even took photos for us at some of the activities we did. 
Just a friendly, nice place to stay. Would I come back, BLOODY OATH. Would recommend (already have) to anyone.  Value for money for sure.... Can't wait to return."
"I had a great time at Grand La Walon.  My room was clean, spacious and had a view of the pool. The bed and couch was comfortable and the fridge was fully stocked. It's located within 10 minutes walking distance from the beach and several restaurants, beach clubs, and places for shopping.  The staff was helpful and made check in very easy and fast--even when my flight was delayed past 1am.  It also helps that most taxi drivers are familiar with the hotel and it's location--in case you will be using taxis to get around."
"I have now stared at Grand La walon  4 times
Every time has been perfect, I can not ask any more
Staff are always helpful 
Price is very reasonable 
Location, walking distance to some great restaurants and the beach
Room and cleanliness is perfect, with the coldest aircon in Bali"
"Thanks for decorate our room with real rose flower.. my wife really love it.This hotel also cozy and they provide tools you can play in the pool..
The staff also very friendly, but for cleaning every morning we need to info the staff, if doesn't our room doesn't get cleaning.. But overall, we really enjoy stay in Grand La Walon.."
The Grand La Walon suited our needs perfectly. Great breakfast. Friendly staff. Great pool. Drink prices were good. Location was perfectfor us. Not to mention the lovely welcome flowers and chocolates that were placed in room for Valentines Day.
"Had a lovely stay at the Grand La Walon. Excellent location, and beautifully maintained facilities. Wifi worked great and pool was lovely to relax by. Only downfall was our room was close to the road and there was a bit of noise on the Saturday night from the bar next door. Would request a room on the other side next time."
having been coming to bali for nearly 40 years I have stayed at many places and have never been disappointed  but at Christmas I came with my family and grand walon just blew me away I loved everything  my pool side room- food - location- staff everyone combined to make this the best yet I have told everyone -my family tell me to stop telling everyone or we wont be able to get a booking when we come back lol
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Bali, Staying at the Grand La Walon, Excellent service with all the staff, very friendly. Rooms always cleaned. Centrally located to all the shops."
"I've been to Grand La Walon twice and they have improved tremendously within short months. 
The pool is excellent and the staff are full of smiles and friendly as ever. 
The only downside is that there are no lift. Though they mentioned are in the works of getting it.
Great job guys."
"Hotel is in a great location, close to kuta, legian and seminyak. All in walking distance. Hotel staff are wonderful, all welcoming, cheerful and happy to help and have a chat. Food and drinks are amazing and well priced. Rooms are clean and tidy, housekeeping do a great job. Reasonably priced, rooms are very modern. 
Hotel is exactly as pictured. 
Close to great restaurants like crumb & coasters, pac man warung, the pad bar on bene and on Jalan legian, Mamas German Restaurant. Close to beachwalk mall on kuta beach and garlic lane in legian. Night clubs are like a 5-10min walk from hotel. Hotel is very central. No cons."
It was a pleasure to stay at the Grand La Walon.  The staff were very friendly and responded quickly to any of our queries or issues.  I would definately recommend this hotel to my friends and family.
"We have stayed at the Grand la Walon every year since they opened 3 years ago and have always loved it but alas this time we were a bit disappointed with the attitude of the staff to the fact we had NO HOT WATER for the entire time we stayed there. After 2 weeks with no hot water they offered to move us to a different room the night before we were booking out, which was a bit silly but when we asked if we could have the room until 4pm they said we had to pay $25 for 4 extra hours. Bad service people."
"The staffs are really friendly and helpful
Actually first time i had a hard time finding here there are two la walon hotel in kuta
This is near mama restaurant remember this!
 Pool is perfect i could have a fun time there"
"It was our anniversary and we arrived to rose petals and anniversary cake on our bed...beautiful touch after a long plane trip. Our room was very spacious, clean and a big comfy bed and pillows. Our room was a grand deluxe with pool access. Very quiet room and couldn't hear any traffic or cleaning trolleys as you often do in bigger hotels in Bali. Only complaint was the lack of hot water.....we had to run the taps for 20 mins before the shower would have hot water. A great stay and would definitely return to Grand La Walon."
Grand La Walon is in  the perfect location. The staff are so friendly and helpful Rooms fantastic and breakfast delicious Highly recommend
"I’m a regular to grand la walon. All my requests were met. Always a great stay there. As a review to future guests the tv is tooooooo small and the shower door is a bit awkward. Staff great and good value for room dining. This trip the shower water had a smell to it... I cannot comment on breakfast as I don’t book breakfast there because it a bit bland, not much variety."
"Nice Clean Rooms, Great Pool n Breakfast"
"Stayed for 6 nights on 3rd floor on back section away from the road. The best breakfast you could ask for, staff were amazing, room & facilities were very clean, close to everything, across the road from handy Circle K shop and around the corner from best exchange rate and honest.  Would definitely come back again."
"My Indonesian partner stayed at this hotel with me as a paid guest, he was on two occasions hassled by security and staff about why he was there and treated poorly as a guest 
I am also certain I booked a room with breakfast as I paid for the more expensive room. Was told on check in that I didn’t have breakfast 
Location is great but extremely disappointed with the attitude of some staff"
"Kamar luas, nyaman, oke"
"Grand la Walon is a nice budget hotel with a beautiful relaxing pool area, lots of sun lounges both in the full sun and shade."
"Pros: room was relatively quiet considering it’s location. 
Cons: air conditioning dripping water all over the floor and there was sewage smell coming from shower drain. Wi-Fi signal in the room was weak and the connection kept dropping."
"The premier deluxe room facing the pool was pleasant, cozy and clean. Breakfast was good and varied. The hotel team was friendly, patient and helpful.  The room has a balcony with hanging rack with sunlight, so that is a plus point to dry our dive/swimming gears.
Glad we stayed here at this 3-star hotel as its money for value."
"From the moment we arrived till we left the staff and facilities were outstanding. Will definitely book again. Loved the fact only 5 min walk to beach and all the restaurants. Money changers right outside little supermarket, laundry and no hassles from anyone to buy buy buy. Usually stay Sanur but so happy with this hotel we will book again over this side."
"Loved staying here! All clean, staff go above and beyond to make your stay lovely. Only negative would be rooms closer to the road have more noise and the shower could be a little warmer."
Clean modern compact hotel with a value for money price. I personally prefer extensive gardens so did move to a garden hotel however the people staying here looked like they were having a really good time.
