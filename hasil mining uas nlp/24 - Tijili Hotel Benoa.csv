"Our stay for 3D2N at Tijili Seaview was really great! You can wake up with sunrise shining on your bed, the view is 10/10. The hotel have many blocks and it might be a little long walk from the lobby to our room. We had some issues with the room card initially, but it was solved quickly. Overall a good stay.
Breakfast was ala carte but nevertheless it tasted great and the staff were all super friendly and nice 👍🏼 Miss Suki specially made goreng pisang dessert for us using her own recipes, it was awesome!
Just a short walk pass the breakfast area is the breathtaking beach views. There are water activties available there for those interested.
Last but not least, we'll like to thank the hotel driver, Mr Chandra who picked us up from the airport after waiting for us for 2 hours because of the long immigration queue. He's very friendly and nice. The car was also very comfortable and clean; the best we ever been on. We even engaged him to drive us around for a day tour. Do request for Chandra when you go to stay at Tijili Hotel!"
"Recommended place to stay.. all stuff are very polite n helpfull. Room is so clean, breakfast buffet was complete enough. We really enjoy staying here, some facility need to be repair but we understand it's because of the pandemic, this hotel got impact. We hope many guest will come and tijili will rise again 😇. Thank u for your service. We are greateful staying in your beautiful place. GBU"
"Breakfast by the beach! What can top that?! The beach was very clean. Food was good. Swimming pools were super clean with very helpful and friendly staff. Everything was great here. If you're looking for a place to stay to enjoy some watersports, you can put this in your list."
"We celebrated our 30 the wedding anniversary at this resort the whole experience was amazing 
From the resort to food to the exceptional staff 
Would totally recommend it 
Terese & John"
"The staff are friendly, clean rooms, wifi is not the best but manageable. Great location."
"The room is quite affordable. It is simple, but all amenities that's needed is there. Great pool. Place is always clean. Staff are accommodating."
"Friendly staff, clean rooms, close access to the beach. Due to the pandemic period, guests who stay are also a little more private"
Location is great and the food esp pizzas are delicious. Highly recommended to stay if you want to be outside Kuta and Seminyak area.
"I thought this hotel is expensive, but on the side. This hotel offer a lot of feature and facilities. They have 2 pools, the first one is on the backyard connecting directly to the beach. And the one is on 6th floor which is you can use for floating brunch/lunch for IDR 400.000 per couple and you can get 1 hour privacy for the whole pool. Definitely will come back again to stay here next holiday."
"Staying 2 nights at the hotel for water sports, we can go directly to the beach & play water sports at the back of the hotel
Hotel is clean, big swimming pool"

"Nice places
Swimming pool was so amazing
Love it very much"
"The service is very good and the staff very helpfull. The room is also clean and quite big room. The food has good taste and the restaurant located at the beach side, which provides very good view.
Highly recommended and will be back again."
"Great pool and directly linked to the beach which is what I loved. The only thing is the safe is not usually activated, so you will need to call the room service to help you with it. The door had also some issues to lock itself… but their staff will sort it out for you. For the price, this price is a great retreat location!"
"Friendly staff, nice and comfy room, really close to the beach"
"Hotel in the beach front area. If you want the beach front , and limited budget, so you must stay at tijili. The experience was nice, nice ambience, nice stay, nice staff. Checkin and out was fast. They offer us free pool access room. Room big enough, and bed comfortable. Cleanliness must improve in many corner of hotel. Breakfast was enough, not very variety, but the ambience are great, in front of the beach. Pool are big, and great. It is next to water sport benoa, very nice. Will back again."
"Stay in this hotel for 2 nights. Unfortunately, the weather was bad so we cannot enjoy sitting near the beach and try the water sport. Overall, the hotel is quite good even though the sofabed position is weird."
"It looks like some of fit and finish of the rooms are wearing out, even though it looks like a relatively new hotel. Wood panels falling off under the tables, shower head holder cracked, tiles breaking off from the pool."
Tijili Benoa is perfect for this
Overall we are very happy to stay in this hotel. Area improvement on garbage collection which was located in basement close to parking lot. The smell was spreaded out in the parking lots.
"The hotel has a private beach at the back area but unfortunately it was not so clean & not recommend for children to play, although we can still have watersport with a good price. Breakfast variety not so much and most likely has the same menu to offer every morning, pool was great, staffs were very friendly with great assistance, thank you Tijili... hopefully the beach cleanliness could be improved as it is your prime attraction :) all my best"
Overall everything really good
"Breakfast menu can be further improved , door locks too... as it often get error"
"Great Location, white sand, beach front breakfast venue, olympic size swimming pool, more than enough parking space, and KING KOIL Bed!"
"Very Clean and have private Beach, u can play watersport there"
"I stayed only 1 night in this place and surprised because there are only few people stayed there. But in the morning when woke up, I suddenly like this hotel very much. I like its business in the morning, all the staffs are good and friendly. The hotel tries its best to Keep open in this pandemic season. Please help this hotel to givi its bet always."
"When you just want to enjoy, spend one or two nights at the hotel with private beach, I think this hotel is okay for you. For the breakfast, it’s very average. Overall, it’s okay, nothing really bothers a lot for us."
Nice and clean hotel
"overall was ok but on some circumstances, as some other reviewers say, its a 4 atars with 3 stars feels. 
what was down side from my experience:
- tv was broken
- no sandals
- room service only till 11 pm"
Hotel was lovely. Great location in terms of on the beach but if you want a lively holiday (we didn’t) then it’s not ideal. Staff wee super and could do enough for us. Room was more than adequate
"(+)
Strategic Location 
Room was clean
Facilities ok
Good for kids and family
(-)
No Sandals in the room
Mini Fridge not too cold"
Good service Beautiful Hotel
"Nice room and location Wifi a bit slow, close to water sport centre"
"Value for money, awesome private beach, nice view. Facilities is simple but works optimal."
"Best part is location beach front and suit for water sport activities
Other things is average"
"Direct access to the beach was nice, so was the view from our seaside room. Unfortunately the toilet shower design is poor and on our first night it flooded the toilet and the main corridor. Housekeeping also was also tardy on a couple of days during our stay, requiring us to call multiple times to get our room cleaned.
 Breakfast was not worth the extra premium, but the room service restaurant (kakatua) was much better"
"Overall good experience,but i think breakfast need improvement"
"Maybe due to pandemic, hotel facilities was not well maintained when I was there. Room and other services  was good though."
Very basic hotel with lovely staff.
The hotel location and the beach are splended. Need bit improvement on the hotel maintenance for its building.
Good enough
"This is much more of a family hotel, the swimming pools are nice but often over taken with kids screaming and playing.  Staff only remove kids for adult only pool when asked. Walls in rooms very thin you can here everything, kids screaming at 11pm at night and nothing done about it."
The food taste is poor
"Stayed for 3nights. Basically they have 3 pools. Kids pool closed. Normal pool open. Roof top pool breeding mosquitoes for nusa dua bali. The beach is very dirty and seems cleaning not done for some time. 
The room was a basic room but it smelled of urine the first time we saw it. We had to air out the room on our own to get rid of the smell. Maybe rooms was not used for sometime.basic tv channels. Housekeeping was very good.guys were friendly. Front desk always Busy using phone laughing and joking among staffs. management please send them for proper training. Basically bali
coming to endemic but tijili benoa has just started going thru their pandemic."
"There was a rat in our room (with our baby) that caused injury to my wife. After lengthy discussion with management, they refused to cover medical costs and made us fight for a refund, all but chasing us out the door. I will be taking legal action against this hotel and suing for damages. Completely disgusted."
During my 4 day stay at hotel there was no internet network in the room or around  the hotel. Too ironic
We stay for 5 (five) days but no internet connection / wifi at room or surrounding the hotel.
"We stayed with Tijili in both Seminyak and Benoa. Both hotels had clean rooms, great breakfast with a lot of choices, and attentive and friendly service. The staff were very helpful. We had some issues(not related to the hotel) and they helped us sort it out. We were really impressed.
In Seminyak the hotel was conviently located, 15 minutes away from the town centre so the hotel was nice and quiet, but there were lots of cafes and shops within a 2 mins walk.
In Benoa, the hotel is right on the beach with a really nice beach front cafe and bar. The food was affordable and not western prices like the other resorts. The beach front is great for dinner, lunch and breakfast as you can dine in front of a good view of the ocean."
"Excellent hotel & pools. Kids club room was clean and our daughters enjoyed spending some time in there (while we made the most of having a Balinese massage at the spa here).  View of the sea at b/fast is perfect!. Live music at times, in the evening, which was good.. staff very friendly. Can walk out to different restaurants to eat & easy to access local supermarkets. Nice and relaxing break. Would recommend for families with young children as they have connecting rooms. Only negative was small balcony but can pay more for sea view & these balconies are a good size. 
Tijili are also eco friendly using re fillable  larger shampoo/ body wash bottles, which we preferred & paper packaging  for soaps etc.. they also have a little veg patch & seem to be constantly attending to jobs to maintain the hotel’s high standard. Thank you Tijili hotel/staff.. our family loved their stay."
"My stay here was only two nights, and the stay was solid on its own. But in that time the Staff, especially security went above and beyond. Here's how.
I ended up getting scammed by a local ""Money Exchange"", who with a sleight of hand did not give me all of the money we originally counted. 
I informed my hotel's night manager. The morning after, the day manager arranged for a hotel security guard to escort me on the motor bike to get the money back. After about 30 minutes of a heated exchange, I was returned only 2/3 of the money I was owed. After we returned back to the hotel however, the Chief of Security - Gabriel, went back with the security guard. They were able to get the police involved and returned to me the rest of my money.
I can't thank the hotel staff, managers, security guards, and security chief enough. They could have done nothing, but instead went through a significant effort to return to me the money I was owed.
Thank you Tijili Hotel!"
"Excellent service from all staff, clean and new hotel facilities, nice pools, nice to hang out at hotel private beach as well as on the roof top with its boundary-less pools... certainly willing to go back to Tijili Hotel Benoa again!"
"This hotel is one of two Tijilis in Bali, the other one being in Seminyak. The vibe here is more family-friendly, and it's nice that they have two pools- a large ground-level pool for families and a small rooftop pool for adults. 
The beach is right behind the hotel, but you can't really swim in it. It's really just for watersports, like jetski or parasailing. There are some OK restaurants in the street that you can walk to, but otherwise there's not a whole lot that you can get to on foot in the area.
The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the wifi was pretty good. The breakfast buffet was OK. The facilities are slightly old, but otherwise pretty modern and clean. Our room was kind of small, and there was a tiny balcony where you can dry your clothes. 
I would suggest taking a taxi down to Nusa Dua in the evening and checking out the really large outdoor shopping and dining complex there.
Overall, not a bad place at all. I would recommend it."
Tijili Hotel Benoa is an ideal hotel for families. The staff were all accommodating & friendly They have a cute Kids Club & Ms. Devi is so kind. She played & talked to my toddler son. The Warung Bamboo Restaurant serves delicious affordable food. The swimming pools & rooms are all clean.
visited nusa Dua for the first time and I was looking for a hotel which had private beach good atmosphere and I would like to tell you guys this is the perfect hotel amazing private beach amazing swimming pool and Yeah the rooms are also very spacious and u have lots of restaurants nearby Indian Chinese Japanese I would recommend this amazing hotel who are looking to relax and spend some quality time with ur family
"We love our stay here at Tijili Benoa, every single thing was pleasant. The facilities are perfect for traveling with kids. The things that might need to improve is the breakfast. Its a not suited for a hotel this nice. Limited options, and they can improve a lot on their coffee. The coffee is a downer. But other than that, we sure had a pleasant stay here. Will definitely come back again, and hopefully they will improve their bfast and coffee."
"My family and I stayed in a connecting room. The service here is fantastic, the staff are extremely helpful and polite. Got locked out of the room by accident, but one of the staff on duty came up immediately with a master key to help unlock it without fuss! The breakfast selection is very good, with a fusion buffet, fresh omelettes, and a wide selection of cold/hot drinks. The dinner is decent, however there are quite a few restaurants outside within walking distance. The rooftop pool is also convenient, with fresh towels available for hotel guests (so you don’t have to bring your own room’s).
However the room cleanliness needs to be improved, as we found a spider web and a spider on the room chair. The neighbourhood is also quite sleepy (Benoa), we came here to unwind before sailing for the Gili islands. Nothing much to do in Benoa.
Overall a great hotel in an average location, would recommend for families."
"We had such a lovely stay at Tijili, check in was easy and they even had our rooms cleaned early so we didn’t have to wait. The rooms were modern and the air con was great, came with a safe, fridge and tea and coffee. Pillows and comfort of the bed was really good. The pools were really amazing, so clean and quiet. The ground were constantly being maintained. Breakfast was a buffet and had loads of choice even with and egg station. The food in the beach bar was lovely just unfortunately the bar staff weren’t so great. They were friendly just all of them didn’t seem to have a clue. We got wrong orders, wrong bills, they only ever had one mojito a day, then no coke, no Fanta, no soda and one day it took us 40 mins to get some daiquiris. It needed a lot more training. Apart from that would stay here again for sure!"
"Very nice hotel, nice and clean and excellent location in the center of Nusa Dua and the staff are very wonderful and treat them excellent and the breakfast is considered to be the same for us Arabs and excellent for the other nationalities, a simple observation is to take care of the cleanliness of the beach and the balance of the nests of the sea"
"Really nice soft bed and pillow, I always cant sleep well with hotel bed but Tijili hotel bed made me sleep so well and doesnt even want to wake up. Food at Warung Bamboo is good with good view. Breakfast needs to be improve."
"The pool is great for kids and the kids club is an amazing place to play for children! Our Son loved it. Breakfast is great, Nice omlets and cappuccino included. Would directly book this hotel again when visiting Nusa Dua"
Hotel staff at bar very friendly snd helpful. Cheap watersports. Clean room. Had to run shower for 5minutes as there was sewage smell wen open the shower. Good breakfast buffet. Evening entertainment was boring. But overall had a fabulous stay at Tijili
"I spent two night in this hotel and were very impressed with the size of the room, the swimming pool, the ambiance and surroundings...and it is close to the water sport stuff...food is within walking distance and it is on the beach..although it was not easy to swim on the Benoa beach ;)   The bed is great and comfy and I wish they put more pillows and the bathroom is a good size. All in all we are very happy with it."
"First - shout out to all the staff for a very good job! They were all friendly, would initiate convos with guests and very polite/accomodating/helpful.  The facilities were clean and loved that everything you want/need is already in the hotel - swim, water activities, eat, lounge around, etc. The kiddie club is really a plus, our son loved it! The 2 days we were there,we only had the pool to ourselves. It's a really new hotel- there's not too many guests during our stay. Plus the location it's just 20-30min drive from airport and its pretty much short walks from convenience stores and nice restaurants (bumbu bali, ketut's bbq, etc). The only comment/suggestion maybe is would've loved more meat selections in the buffet breakfast but maybe that's just us,dont get us wrong the buffet spread is sufficient and decent. Will definitely recommend and stay here again if we come back to Bali!"
"This is a very good hotel and is located right on the beach of Benoa. There is a swimming pool that is suitable for swimming until 10 pm, there is also a swimming pool for young children. The hotel facilities are also very good, there is a children's playground on the 3rd floor (kids corner) complete with all the games and staff who are on guard to look after our children. The place is clean, the view of the sunrise in the morning is very beautiful. And all hotel employees are very friendly.
However, this hotel must be considered if you are a Muslim. because the restaurant is not halal (even though they can cook halal food, but I recommend not eating at the restaurant), just order an omelet for breakfast, because it is definitely HALAL. If you are hungry or just want to have lunch and dinner, just go out of the hotel then the right side of the hotel there is a place to eat ""ayam geprek"" (halal and cheap)."
"We love this hotel!
Location is nice @benoa. Traffic around the hotel was friendly.  

Direct access to the beach is what we love the most. 
Nice pool and water playground for kids. 

If there is anything that can make it best, there were lot of ants in the room."
"I enjoyed my stay at Tijili Benoa. Restaurant Bamboo is just next to the beach.  I had my meals while enjoying the view. It was quite relaxing. Clean, although the water in shower room sort of have a smell but only for few seconds. The staffs were friendly and helpful."
Suka sama tijili hotel krn ada private beachnya. Tapi makanan rasanya biasa saja tp saya suka krn penyajian kopinya seperti di cafe.
"thanks for good facilities and helpfull in tijili, i'm happy enough for all packaging facilities in tijili, hope soon to visit tijili benoa in next time...."
"Excellent property next to the beach, service little slow but workable"
"Best value, Private beach.. just tijili your choice!"
"Wanted ocean view. Tigili has it and it is wonderful at what I consider a reasonable price. Ocean view balcony is large; courtyard balcony is too tiny to be called a balcony. All staff were friendly and responsive. Room clean and spacious. Great air conditioning and shower was good. 
Breakfast was ok but that is all good I can say compared to other hotel I stayed at in Kuta. 
Beach is small but private. Restaurants outside on the street are plentiful but about a 10 to 15 minute walk to a better selection. 
Checkout was too lengthy (15 minutes) while front desk staff had to go to my room to confirm I did not steal anything. 
If I returned to BaliI would stay here again."
"We arrived to hotel at 3pm so we come to receptionist to check in after they checked so many times and told us have welcome drink at their restaurant and said will call us when the room ready, so after 30 minutes waiting from receptionist to the restaurant no one told us to received rooms and we so tired after a long moving from airport to hotel. 
Well we decided back to receptionist to ask why the room still not ready because it's 4pm now? When we come and ask they don't answer those questions and when we become angry they started to told us sorry and change the new rooms for us. So why they don't do it when the started and let we waited for an hour???? 
We really disappointed about the service in here and never come back"
Just a few selection food during breakfast
Relaxing nice hotel
"The room was so colorful, have sofa bed so no need extra money for extra bed, the beach is like private beach, located at tanjong benoa with all the choices of watersports but not crowded because the people ther mostly only guests from hotel"
Nice hotel with beach access kids are happy
Nice and clean. Worth it
"From hotel pool, just go to the beach and all of watersports are available."
This is my 3rd times stayed at this hotel. Before pandemy all is fine thats the reason we choose this hotel again. But they dont mantain properly. And the staff was not profesional.
"If u r a smoker, remember the balcony is not for smoking.."
Recomended
"Great facilities for children such as playground, lots of kids swimming pool, adult swimming pool, just by the beach, modern rooms, water sport activities.
Could have been better:
- breakfast menu
- wifi and broadband network"
That was bood On The linen
"Tijili is a value for money place to stay in Bali. Is located at one of the best locations, good for water sports, good for kids to enjoy beach and 2 pools."
"Loved the hotel since I saw Dallas Clayton’s illustration at the lobby! The place is clean and well maintained, you can see traces of the pandemic blow but they are definitely trying and it works. We got an upgrade from the friendly staff and they were very responsive and helpful. Bamboo restaurant is probably our favorite, the food is vary and the beachfront breakfast is one of the highlights of our short weekend getaway. Our daughter loves the playground and everyone was so nice and friendly. Definitely will recommend to our friends and relatives."
"The staff provide good service,theyre very responsive and helpful. Hotel facilites good and clean, i booked the room with sea view and it was great. The breakfast facilites need improvement, other than that everything r great"
You need to pick your luggage to your room & you need to find your room by yourself as they just give you direction from the reception take a right downstairs take a left ……..
Close to airport with beach and beach activities access.
"I came on 21 March with my family to enjoy experience during Silent day. 
On 22 March during breakfast, i came at 9am and no food display in the buffet, for the room service can't order and wait until 9pm, the staff is un polite, especially the manager in charge in front desk
However Housekeeping service fast response"
"Overall OK, got discriminated in the resto as usual because I am local, they don't greet and help you with anything at all. Striking difference compare to serving foreigner ☺️. I thought they were at least better."
"Not too crowded hotels, swimming pool is in fromt of our room, and have access to private beach just walking via the restaurant"
"It’s not a new hotel, but good enough for couple and family who wants to stay near the beach. The price quite economical with clean renovated room and facility. The location is quite far from the city, but surroundings are complete with entertainment, restaurants, mini markets, etc."
Lots of ants in my room. Terrible smell of entire building. I ran away.
"Clean, nice view for sunrise.
Free taxi to DFS"
"Pros: friendly staff,  easy to find location. Good restaurant near the beach.
Cons: inadequate lighting, especially ground floor walk ways to the beach. Common toilets are smelly.  There should be a restaurant at the lobby level."
Nice staff
Great hotel. Good kids facilities. Would recommend. We had a great stay.
"Very friendly staffs, good location and excellent facilities"
"We paid in advance for a week, didn't like the place when we found it different from the pics, wanted to stay only 2 days instead of the week but they refused to refund. So, take a risk based on pics and if its not as per what you expected (room size, cleanliness etc.).. then your money is wasted !"
"I visited this hotel with my wife & kids ..
The kids club is great, they have toys and stuff, perfect for my kids..
They have restaurant with a sea view, which is nice..
The room..is normal..everything is clean & working well as supposed..because I book a deluxe room, which is pretty standard for a room in almost every hotel..
Overall, I look forward to stay in this hotel again whenever I have a time.."
"Infinity pool, warm pool and beach side"
"I like that it's affordable and in beach front. The pools are nice and clean. We enjoyed both the infinity pool and the ground pool. The staff are all nice. We enjoyed the pool zumba, the staff are very entertaining and friendly. We enjoyed walking a long the beach. We walked up to the part where there are giant statues. We took photos. Very nice views. This resort has good food. We enjoyed everything. Nice ambiance , too. The restaurant is open, you can see the beach while eating. We enjoyed it all!"
"This was my first experience staying at Tijili, Tanjung Benoa. Great location, only few steps away from Benoa Bay. Breakfast was just okay for me, nothing special about the meals. The hotel was so big that it is confusing for us to get into our rooms as they have about 70 rooms within one floor. Their availability of kids zone is one thing remarkable for me, though."
"Friendly and helpful staff, greeting you by name always with a smile on your face.
Breakfast could have more variety.
Beach walks are amazing at low tide.
Not so crowded like Kuta."
"We really enjoyed this hotel. The pricing was great, the location great and the staff really excellent"
Great room! Right on the beach which was beautiful. However you cant really swim in the area. The location wasnt great as you would need a ride to anywhere you go.
its a good hotel and have good facilities. The beach is not a swimming beach.
It’s good for family with kids to be
"I like this hotel beach and walking and pool available and access to many place.
It could be recommended to any one where acceptance is high 
If I come yes will stay again"
Good breakfast and have pathway to Nusa Dua area
The layout of the resort is very inefficient... Had a long walk going to the beach/pool from the room.  Very few breakfast food and the  food refill in the buffet takes very long.  Food are expensive also.
"This hotel is owesome. Good, clean, swimming pool is nice, facilities are ok. staff are ok. i wish to come back next tris. the room is very good can fit 2 adults and 2 kids"
Hotel was nice... bambbo resto just right on the beach.. garden and pool very nice.. kids club staff was nice.. just not right when cecking in that my room was downgraded to balcony terrace instead of sea view with unexplainable reason..
"The location is superb with magnificent sunrise view. The sun lounge are limited, so the experience is spoilt by hotel guests who place towels to ""book"" the lounges as early as 7am though they don't use it at all until much later of the day. Management should really do something about this."
Beautiful beach at the beck yard
"This hotel is great for families and quite affordable. Big swimming pool, friendly staff, good breakfast close to the beach. Love that you can enjoy the beach without leaving the hotel."
great place
"We loved our stay, it was very clean staff were extremely friendly and food was great. We had 3 kids under 2 and the 2 kids pool and the kids club were perfect. We loved eating looking out to the beach. We will definitely visit again."
Facilities well maintain and staff was great. But some area can be improve like towel is kind of wear already.
"Private beach, nice pool, have watersport, breakfast Ok. Will be back again. Thanks"
