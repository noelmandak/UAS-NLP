Column 1
"The beach is so quite, not crowded. The room is so spacious and luxurious. This place is must visit if you are in Bali. If you have plan to go to bali safari and marine park this hotel is the best place to stay."
"I found this hotel very quite and peaceful. What make this hotel unique is the sound of strong waves can be heard from inside the room. 
This 5 stars hotel might be the most affordable one in the area. It's luxurious and you get services like it must be. One thing that bother me was the water dead in two seperated times. Luckily it was solved very fast."
"Great hotel for recreation.
It’s good to come here with children’s or/and with your passion.
It’s quiet and peaceful.
The food and breakfast is good, but nothing special at normal time. But I try special menu limited available for Chinese new year - it was very tasty!
If you want to party or have fun - choose another place ;)
I recommend this hotel to stay!"
Very accommodating - delicious breakfast buffet.  Clean. Great value.  Quiet spot to relax in after going out and exploring.
"salah satu hotel terbaik di bali, pantainya lgs dpt di akses, kamar bersih, besar, kamar mandi jg oke.. next time pst akan ksana lg"
"Wyndham Tamansari has the best view for relaxation. Traffic wasn't high as it is located 45mins from Kuta and 30mins away from Ubud. 
The food is pleasant.  Staff communicate well in English. Transportation hired by the hotel is polite, friendly and helpful. 
Room is clean. Housekeepers clean the room daily. Staff gave warm smiles and very helpful"
"Beach front hotel with spacious room and  nice bathroom.. the beach is volcanic sand beach (black), but you can hear the wave sound from your room... Nice"
Quiet and peaceful stay at this hotel. Great food and an ATM onsite. The hotel transportation was convenient and it had a beautiful ambiance by the sea.
"We had a lovely family time , a perfect bonding experience with my dad and my daughter.
A black sand charm a nice long walk at the beach- it was perfect"
Hotel location is good..and sufficient rooms for 2people. Food taste is OK.
"Friendly staff, always smiling and greeting.  Beautiful landscape of the rice fields, black sand and waves.  On rainy days, the staff would help to shelter us as well."
"Our room was very spacey and comfortable. The kids enjoyed the private pool so much. The hotel was very beautiful, with a lot of plants and places to explore. Food was good both in the restaurant and in the beach club, and it was not expensive. Every staff we met were really nice and helpful. We will definitely come back and stay again at this hotel. However, they have to pay more attention on the private pool area. A lot of dirt and small animals poop an the area."
"Thank you for all the assistance during our stay, all the staff were so helpful…"
"Great place away from the city and very peaceful. Local driver that you can ask for at the front desk, Nyoman, is the best in Bali."
"Superb king size bedroom , amazing seaview from bedroom, very large room, friendly staff and location in the village suit for relaxing."
"The pool is very nice, my family love it so much."
"Sad that there is no beach . But ur staff made a difference with their niceness , kindness , their smiles ,respectfulness , humbleness and thankfulness all speaks volumes ."
"Very clean room and nice staff
Reception though is I find it gloomy because it’s lacks lighting"
"Great place, especially the pool"
"Amazing view , wonderful black sand beach."
"I was staying here for GFNY Bali 2020
Its close to the venue and also close to Bali Marine Safari park. Overall the hotel was very nice, all the staffs are friendly and helpful. They got 2 swimming pool, spa, gym. It was nice an quite the bed is so comgy"
Its really nice hotel in fromt of the beach
"Recommended, nice view & very clean 👍🏻"
Very good for group stay in here
Same as above
"Nice hotel but too far from Kuta beach area
Overall it is value for money."
"This resort has excellent rooms, food and beverage. There are little or no problems with the internet connectivity. The property is clean and well maintained. The staff are helpful and polite. If you are looking for a quiet resort away from the popular tourist areas this is an excellent choice. Note there is only one restaurant in the resort and there are no local shops. The next location is at least 30 minutes drive. Daily transport options are available."
"Good place,"
"It's a little dated....the location  is a bit far from anything but 15mins from the safari (reason we booked it"" and about 1hr from ubud....food and staff are mostly awesome....one waitress at the restaurant isn't very attentive.....ask for ground floor.....waiting time for gojek and grab are up to 15-20mins....."
"They have the best services during my one week Idul Fitri holiday in Bali compared to others. Yet there is no such perfect thing. This hotel has no dedicated parking lots for disability. Also the parking lots were not adequate during high season, the management of it wasn't the best.
The facilities, breakfast and services were top noth though."
"Everything is good, except there's no slippers and laundry bag in the room"
location wise to  bali safari
I'm amazed by how friendly and helpful the Personal was. The best Service I travelled with 2 kids and everything was 5star service. Thank you for making our holiday awesome.
nice place but not this place need more maintenance
beyond expectation
"This consider as nice resort, room was clean, unfortunately the pool not that clean, water already turn green. Staff is nice and helpful"
"We chose this hotel because we just needed an overnight sleepover in this specific area. But, for those who are tourists looking for a Bali vacation, the location is not  very nice (absolutely nothing within walking distance). The beach isn't really nice, breakfast was mediocre. And, the hotel is slightly run-down. But, the price is nice. So, it may still fit many people's needs."
"This hotel is a great sample of how post-pandemic travel will looks like in the early phase. It's clearly understaffed and though the staff did their best to accommodate our needs, it felt lacking still.  There are no room sandals, the toiletries seems incomplete and the bath towel also feels limited.
There are clear sign of the building not well-maintained enough and in the beginning we had no idea how to operate the lift (the G button is missing and sticked with a sticker but the G ink faded). I hope things get better soon and I'll still recommend this hotel because you can feel the staff is trying their best."
"We were enjoyed the staying. But at night aircon broken, and we were sleeping in a hot."
Since we travel with small children. Low lighting and dark nuance maybe a bit creepy for small kids
"Plus: staff is good and pool is really nice. It's really big and lots of chairs to sit. You get 2 free welcome drinks which you can use for beer at the pool, that's nice. 
Cons: I ate at the restaurant three times. The food is simply terrible. It really needs to be improved, I was shocked at the lack of quality. The beach is right in front of the hotel but it has pretty big waves. Can't really hang out there. It would be nice if the hotel cleaned the beach area, there was some plastic trash. The cheapest rooms are small with no balcony. Overall the place doesn't feel like a 4 star hotel. It feels cheap, you can hear others in the hallway. It feels like a motel, not a higher end hotel. It's at least 25% overpriced. You need a motorbike or car if you stay here, there is no where to walk."
"I stayed here for 1 night to celebrate my birthday 🥳. The room we get is huge and they are with ocean 🌊 view.
Breakfast need to improved their service. Asked to have a coffee first but ended up the meals arrives first than coffee ☕️ 
So far the cleanliness are well except for the pool maybe due to pandemic so that they are not in a good maintained."
"Rooms are specious, unfortunately it was very musty, we can’t barely sleep well because of musty smell on our bed and pillow. Spider web by the bed head and furniture. Pool & plunge lack of maintenance it makes water milky.
It’s the time for this property to start maintaining the cleanliness."
"Took Ocean View King Suite... the waves were so big that you could feel the shakes numerous times.
The hotels has the potential for vacation goers but the upkeep of the hotel need to be looked and prioritized.  The food was just average, don't expect too much.  The gym was not properly upkept."
"Jauh, kamar bau apek"
Double check if they still have construction... Breakfasts needs a little upgrade..  I book hotel with in room jacuzzi but jacuzzi is not working...
"Pros: 1. Good a la carte menu 2. Good for relaxing, away from the crowd. 3. Friendly staff.
Cons: 1. Limited buffet. 2. slow service, 3: amenities not up to 5 stars standard."
Semuanya mantap benar
"I was expecting a 4 star but I would give it maybe 3 if that. 
Cons; The grounds haven’t been maintained, the pool was so dirty I couldn’t go in it, yoga facilities weren’t even operational no activities and lastly the food wasn’t the greatest out of 5 I would give a 2. 
Pro; rooms were nice, and they gave you 2 drink vouchers upon arrival. 
I was suppose to stay 5 nights… decided to leave early and depart to a different hotel after 2 nights."
"Hotel looks modern and chic but the lack of maintenance was a let down. First room we checked in had the water heater and wifi not functioning. Jacuzzi in the subsequent room was not functioning as well and had algae / moss on its metal parts as well.
Love the looks and feel of the hotel but might not choose to return unless serious maintenance work is done."
Hotel was already worn out need renovation badly. However staff was friendly
ROOM : DIRTY! TOILET : Hot water limited! BUILDING : messed up! POOL : Disgusting. SERVICE : only this parts is Good. NOT WORTH IT!!
"We rented 4 rooms for 2 nights.  On the first night, at 11 pm there were still guests chatting and smoking in the hallway.  They were very noisy and cigarette smoke entered our room.  I have asked the receptionist to give a warning to the guests but there is no response and the guest is still chatting until 3 in the evening.  There was no follow-up from the hotel regarding our complaints.  Until we have to give a direct warning to these guests 
Bed sheet & bed cover are dirty & smell bad. , smell cigarette even though it was non smoking room. 
The quality of staff were poor.  The receptionists unprofessional because  they make us have to go back twice to the room because the room card that was informed  by the receptionist was not in one of the room, even though the room card is still held by the receptionist.🤦‍♀️
Definitely NEVER GO BACK to  the Hotel Anymore."
"Property and rooms are dated and not maintained. You can find cobwebs all around the property even in your room. Rust is like a norm in every room (having seen three in two days).  We found the water dripping from roof, private pool in the villa not clean and having different kind of objects in the pool.
Must mention that the staff (chef, f&b, front office) is great but they also can’t do much of the property is in the condition that it is."
"We stayed here for 1 night, but We were not enjoyed the staying, changed room twice. First , round marble top table  was broken. Second, the bathroom doesn't have hot water. There are clear sign, that the room not checked properly before let guest come in.  The pool, looks not in good maintaned. The food is simple & doesn't appetizing, need to be improved. But their staff very kind & helpful."
"We book oceanfront suite which was good in terms of design but there were massive spider webs & ants all over the room. Cleanliness was not considered & it was a nightmare to talk in english with their staff. 
They changed our room after complaining & the other room they provided us was again disaster, the plunge pool & sliding channel was broken."
Hotel didnot mention some facilities closed due to covid and they didnt get over it yet. Not worth the money you pay location far from town. Beach cannot do anything as it smell bad
"pictures look so different from the actual place. in. reality, room was not clean, stains found on towels and bedsheets and facilities were not up to standard. did not feel comfortable in the room at all."
Exept the room which is quiet big everything was wrong nothing goes right not coming back
I called in advance amidst the coronavirus pandemic and they told me they can’t do anything to help cancel/refund my booking. They just want your money and don’t care about their customers.
"We stayed at the Wyndham Tamansari Jivva because a friend was having her wedding at a nearby resort.  It was rather quiet at the hotel - apparently they'd only opened in November - but we found the staff extra attentive to our every need.  We made use of the fabulous happy hour every weekday from 12 - 7 PM.  Huge fan of the pina colada.  The pool felt like an oasis, and we were literally the only ones on the pool deck for our three days there.  The food wasn't particularly amazing (sandwiches came out a bit soggy via room service) but I did find the breakfast a pretty good deal for 90, 000 IDR.  I would stay there again, but just know that there isn't much within walking distance so you'll need to find a driver to get around (Though apparntly there is a free shuttle that takes you somewhere closer to town)."
"This is my 7th time back to Bali, i prefer book a nice resort and stay back relax enjoy my vacation with love at the pool side. To highlight is the hotel just next to beach side, and the sand is black sands. For sure will be back for next visit in Bali.Nearby resort about 5km there is Restaurant name : Warong Legong, Keramas Beach, Gianyar-Bali. The food is so much yummy and the price is reasonable , after my first visit the owner are so kind to offer us free transportation pick up and transfer to resort, for those who really want to enjoy authentic Balinese food is a must! Just search the name in Facebook give them a call they will pick you."
"Before I did booking i has knew the location is not in happening area and less crowed , thats what i looking for , stay back and relax enjoy my vacation with love at the pool . To highlight is the hotel just next to beach side, and the sand is black sands. For sure will be back for next visit in Bali.Nearby resort about 5km there is Restaurant name : Warong Legong, Keramas Beach, Gianyar-Bali.

Just search the name in Facebook give them a call they will pick you."
"Despite the administrative issue (i book a room with ocean view, but the staff redirect it to other type with paddy rice view. After i complained, i finally get the room with ocean view for the 2nd night), i dare to say that the hotel is amazing. Good experience to stay in other side of Bali, far from crowds and nightlife, we can find peace and tranquility here at Wyndham. We'd like to stay here again when the weather is nice and calm to enjoy the black sandy beach."
"Beautiful resort with its special atmosphere for those who want some quiet time away from hustle bustle cities. Hotel surrounded with villages and I enjoyed taking a walk on the black sand beach watching day to day life of local people. The main issue in that location, and it’s common around Bali, is that I couldn’t request a taxi from outside company like Uber, Grab etc as hotel in collaboration with local community restricted an entry area around the hotel to those taxi service providers!!! This was huge disclaimer! As guests basically forced to use hotel’s cars.
Hotel provides good range of activities, personally I would prefer more yoga and meditation classes as they have beautiful spot well equipped for yoga. SPA is really good and therapists are attentive and professional. Food is good. I loved thematic dinners set in different style every evening. And every hotel staff I’ve met during my 10 days stay made me feel comfortable and welcomed. I would love to go back. Thank you team!"
"Service is excellent. To be honest everything was perfect for a quiet getaway. However travelers should note that there are limited means to get around to other places, even supermarkets. The hotel transport is really expensive; almost x2-3 times market rate. I would recommend this place for those who plan to have a relaxing stay within a resort instead of going around. Because it is located in a uncommon area, there are very few or no taxis and even grab or uber cars. Even day tour operators rarely come out to this part of Bali though I managed to get a trip to Telaga Waja river. The hotel could consider getting shuttle services to more places and also get more tourist info on what they can do around the area or get around.
A bigger, more impt point to note is that each night, when the wave pounds on the shore, the room shakes even on the 3rd floor. I understand the Mgmt is getting that checked now -- this is the very least a hotel needs to guarantee -- tt bldg is safe to be in."
Wyndham Jivva amazed me so much!!! Definately we'll be back in our next holiday! Keep up the good work
Two weeks traveling around bali and this was definitely the best food and cocktails we had. Hotel is just 2 months old and not on everyone's radar but it is an absolute must for everyone.  We stumbled upon it as we were going to go to bali safari...instead we relaxed in the beautiful pool bar and enjoyed gorgoues lunch and dinner in peaceful surroundings.  We walked Along the black sand beach to be welcomed by lovely tourists going about their business. All in all I would highly recommend this peice of heaven hotel
"Location was 3 hours drive from Ngurah Rai Airport, 2 hours from Seminyak/Kuta, 1.5 hours from Nusa Dua. The hotel, to put it simply, is in the middle of nowhere and transport for a single traveller can cost quite a bomb (I'd say my room rate + 2 way transport -more expensive than my room rate - can get me a room in the Grand Hyatt or Sofitel in Nusa Dua)
Still interested?
+ The property is magnificent; the architecture, the landscaping, the facilities, the room was well appointed.
+ Real Bali; you can hear morning chants from nearby temple.
+ Great pool for children
+ Black sand beach was beautiful, albeit dirty.
+ Very quiet, perfect for me-time, when the hoard of tourists from 2 large asian countries are sleeping/on day trip elsewhere.
- The breakfast buffet food? Does not look appetizing to be honest, it is worse than a local, non-chain 3* hotel in Kuta.
- Food price was on the high side, no other options nearby for food (no local market nearby either for street food)"
"it's an amazing hotel, with a very nice swimming pool, very good rooms, modern and beautiful villas. everything is amazing except that is in the middle of nowhere. if you want to run away from the busy -Kuta, Legian or Ubud is the best option but if its your first visit to Bali dont go there or you will have a wrong impression about what is bali. i´ve been more than 3 times so i do recommend this hotel but knowing where are you going. the stuff is very kind. the hotel is just in front of a very nice  black sand beach. not good for swimming but very nice scenary."
"We  really enjoyed our 5 nights stay here. The staff were very professional and helpful, always smiling and willing to help. The hotel is a good mix of luxury and local, set in a quiet rural area it is a great getaway if you want some time away from the busy tourist areas. The gardens are stunning and the beachfront area is very comfortable and creative with lots of place to relax. During our stay the main pool was undergoing repairs which was unfortunate as this is one of the main attractions of the hotel. Although this was disappointing, there was another pool available. Food at the beachfront restaurant is very good as is the service, reasonably priced too! There are also several local places to eat outside the hotel. The hotel offers reasonably priced scooter hire to get around otherwise Grab (Indo's Uber) is an option but not always available. Thanks to all the staff that made our staff special!"
"Location is just what I was hoping for; away from it all. Padi fields and the mountains on one side, ocean on the other. Facilities are excellent, staff were friendly, attentive, etc.
During one night of our stay, there was a big 100+ group from some company having their annual family gathering. They held a function next to the pool, nice garden party by the looks of it. All is good., until a lot them stayed up all night, chatting loudly, mucking around, jumping in the pool ,  yelling at each other (you get the hint) until 3 AM in the morning. We were in the ground floor and the room next to us had a balcony party. Needless to say that it was a restless night for us. I'm expecting the staff members to be act as the fun police in consideration to the other guests. I understand that the resort highly valued the patronage of the group (also signified by the increased quality of the breakfast the following morning), but that shouldn't be at the expense of the other paying guest."
"The hotel good for couple because the atmosphere very quiet, romantic & feel comfort. The hotel also close to the beach with beautiful black sand. The breakfast also good & delicious. The pool also friendly for the kids.
We will back to this hotel again if break for hoilday in Bali.
 Thank you."
The Wyndham is the best hotel I've ever stayed in! The staff are friendly and polite. The factilities are excellent.
"I stayed in Suite Jacuzzi With Ocean View room for 2 nights and lets start with the bad.... the jacuzzi as i expected is rusty and dirty making it a turn off for us to use it and in the end, we only used once. This is normal since its sitted outdoor and near the sea. Dont expect warm or hot water from the jacuzzi either, its normal there's only cold water which is perfect for day time soaking. Note that the wooden sliders are redundant so skinny dip in your jacuzzi at your own risk since it serves zero privacy filter. I really wish the balcony lights were controllable as if we could off it, we may have seen stars but i believe its central. Now, moving on the the most painful part............. hot water is not stable and defeats the purpose of using the bathtub. Engineering team came to increase the temperature, it was better but after awhile, the hot water turned cold. The bathtub was leaking and engineering team made a mess so we called housekeeping. The housekeeping team was awesome, they had initiative and were attentive - we mentioned we need them to clean and dry the floor because the bathtub leaked and they actually housekept the whole bathroom!
Expect to feel your bed 'shake' whenever there is a strong current, was scary at first but you'll get used to it. The room was clean and comfy, the TV had a few ininteresting channels. Unfortunately, we did not try any food nor drinks from this hotel so no comments there but the room dining menu looks promising. I agree that this hotel area lacks of food as this hotel is standing by itself (aside from locals doing their ceremony outside) and other things but you can always rent a bike and go around......
The best part was the view... so beautiful it looks like a screensaver. I can stand at the balcony all day and night listening to the waves. Note that there are signs of no swimming in the sea due to very strong currents!
I hope this new hotel will manage to keep up with the maintenance..... we might be back - still"
"- extremely friendly and very kind staff, the whole staff ; security, receptionist, housekeeper, restaurant staff, beach club staff, SUPERB NICE.
- room not that spacious as I order the twin room. Bathroom are clean. Complete aminities.
NOTE : there is a some black spot on out pillow case, for the next I advice to check it again.
- Perfect view, both. Sea View or Garden View. Both are peacefull.
- Food for breakfast. For 5 star hotel, as Agoda mention. They provide standard menu breakfast just like 4 star hotel. But taste for the food are good, don't worry about this.
NOTE : I think, the resto staff, need more staff as I saw, only some work in resto area. Such as, the one in omellete Area, she's also taking care of Chicken soup area. Also she's checking, quantity for the food. And the one who standing in front to check the room number for the guest, he's also looking around the help other.
- Location,  An hour to Kuta/Legian/Jimbaran. An hour to Ubud. 1.30mins to Uluwatu area."
"Beautiful resort stayed for 5 days, staff are wonderful-talk to visitors, always greeted with a smile excellent service. Delicious food and great value for money. It’s a family friendly hotel, peaceful and great location to relax instead of the whole party scene. Great facilities and well presented. First day I was there I was already planning to come back, hopefully the vibe of the place does not change."
"This place is very calm and relaxing away from the tourist rush of other areas of Bali.
I loved the fact that this place opens to the beach which was very private and nice.
The evening DJ was great with good music and ambiance.
The sound of the waves was very nice."
Really enjoy our 3 nights stay here...although the location is far from Kuta or Denpasar. It's a nice accomodation if you're planning to take the kids to Bali Safari & Marinne Park and want to relax at the hotel's swimming pool. Hard to find restaurant nearby expect for the Hotel's restaurant.
"We were so lucky to stumble onto this absolute gem of a hotel! Our room was AMAZING with stunning pool and sea views and a balcony with a spa bath too. It was our 25th wedding anniversary and we arrived to the warmest of welcomes and our room decorated for our occasion. It is a quiet location, surrounded by farmlands- so relaxing! The beach sand is black and the waves white. So unusual and stunning. The staff are really kind, friendly and helpful. The location is near Ubud (to the west), Safari Park, Blue Lagoon, (which is a must for tourists for the views and awesome snorkeling), as well as a ferry ride across to Nusa Penida and Nusa Lambogen. We had the most incredible holiday and highly recommend this first class hotel!"
A nicely designed hotel. Stayed with a big family group for an event in Gianyar. Accomodates our big group easily as they have lots of rooms with a friendly price too. There is also a garden bar where the young members of the family can hang out at night.
"The location is okay. There's a small gym and spa. You can't swim at the beach because the waves are too volatile, but the company is thoughtful enough to make space for white sand by the poolside. Some places doesn't seem to be clean or safe enough but understandable since the economy has just started to pick up and they might be short on staff. I would suggest to keep the kids (or the drunkards) off the railings since i noticed some of them are rusty. I didn't order breakfast but i heard it was good. It's quite close to Bali Safari and Marine park, and you can reach the ricefields and highlands area in Gianyar or enjoy the beach in Sanur in about 30-45 minutes depending on the traffic by car. Traffic can be quite bad on the weekends."
Staff good
Family resort with 2 large swimming pools.. but the beach you only can see but not able to swim in... Love the sound of the wave.. Friendly staff... Good food... worth every penny...
"If you want to avoid the super-crowd like Kuta, Seminyak or Canggu, you might opt to go to Karangasem area and stay at Wyndham. It also has beach view directly from the hotel. The ambience is very nice, you can view sunrise and sunset everyday from the beach. Room is clean, staff are very nice and friendly. By the way, try the spa & massage here, it's superb. Breakfast buffet is worth the money."
"Spend a weekend here with my dad, was a lovely time - the restaurant is located by the beach."
"So glad to be here, good service & food, Amaze room 👍"
"not the five-stars resort & hotel that met our expectation. 
private pool water was green and cloudy. after re-cleaning process, the water's still green and cloudy. We didn't even want to touch the water.
lots of ants and spiders in the villa.
wicker bamboo table was very dirty
glass door hinges was broken 
definitely not coming back"
Lights out not once but TWICE at my room
"Good view, good room, and good pool"
Nice place for family vacation with fine services and beautiful beach
over all...okey
"+room big
+ staff nice and helpful
- room dirty
- pool dirty
- bathtub not working
- pool in the room not working
- aircon fix after complain
- breakfast not just neutral.
If you are looking a  big room, this hotel good for you.
Other than the room maybe consider others."
Need to improve the taste of the breakfast.
"Amazing Beach property, last time we visited here was so messy but they've improved their standards."
Very value for money
"We stayed there for silent day, the guys at the receptionist was very friendly, and I remember I call them to ask if someone can get my husband a lighter, the guy I think his name is Deva offers his lighter . Thanks to him."
"Nice place with nice view of the beach, sadly the location is far away from the centre of the city, quite hard to find food to eat outside of delivery foods."
Spacious room and Nice view
The best value only to far from activities
"Everything is perfect except that we find a broken shower at our room. It is quite isolate from other place, so I would recommend this hotel if you have a car/motorbike."
"1:30 mins from the airport, nothing is around. The hotel has a small non-air conditioned restaurant, and that’s all you have. No beach, no poolside coconuts, no propper beach views. Very underwhelming"
Nice view
The place was amazing. People are so warm and accommodating.
Good hotel for 1nite stay
"children swimming, good food being eaten, walking path and ocean soundscape."
"Like many other hotels, this hotel has suffered from covid shut down and it is still struggling to be fully operational. The location is a bit far from everything."
"This hotel is in such a bad state that it should not been available. I think you should realize that during the pandemic some hotels didn’t keep maintaining there property and when there where aloud to open again they just opened without any general cleaning ore proper update. The pictures showing on your platform are pre pandemic and misleading. This hotel will ruin a lot of people’s holiday and I think it’s your responsibility as well to feel responsible for what you are selling. 
Please do something with this information!"
"We loved our stay in this hotel, very clean and very relaxing , it will give a good vibes ..and your heart and soul will be fed by the nature..very relaxing...we will be back for sure ..and kiddos to all of the staff members .. 💯 polite and attentive and friendly.hospitality is superb and beyond expectation 
Thank you.our wedding anniversary became more special thank you see u again soon ❤️"
"Clean and big rooms, nice view, pleasant and friendly staff, delicious food. I will definitely comeback here❤️"
When I book this hotel didn’t know that can’t refund or change the date I didn’t go for this vacation cos I have to work what kind of vacation is this
Worthy
So dirty
ok
Overal good hotel. It's little bit far from foodcounters etc.  The beach site is under construction. Food is great and room was pleasant. Maybe come back one day.
Hotel and facilities are good and price reasonable. Just the location is way too far out from civilization.
"Room for 5* hotel was quite small around 25m² without bathtub.
they gave us room just opposite under maintenance of restaurant  its so noisy until 9.15 PM.
They shouldn't sell the room where we stayed. The FO said for the upgrade we have to pay extra. 
Be aware booking the lowest category, its not worth the money.
This is not our first time visit to this resort, but our last experience made our day ruined.
There were flies eggs on our food. It cannot be accepted. 
We were unhappy stay there and won't back."
"The staff are very friendly, but their service is terrible and they dont seem to understand anything, they just say yes and come back to you with the wrong order. The hotel looks tired aswell, umbrellas around the pool are broken and faded, the sunlounger cushions are stained, the bean bags look old and used."
"Very friendly staffs, good facilities, nice pool, good beach club bar, etc.  A little bit away from other things in Bali."
Had a free room upgrade & thanks to Atik (unsure of spelling) at the front desk for her kind assistance. The beach isn't inviting but the scenery stunning. Didn't patronize its restaurant but its spa service was excellent. Hope to go back when its beach front renov is up.
