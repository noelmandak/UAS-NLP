I chose correctly when I surfed some hotels in Bali to stay with my 11yo niece. The big highlight of this hotel is their swimming pool! OMG…. We love it! And the breakfast was also very good. They have many options. And the staffs are super friendly and helpful. We will definitely come back here!!! We miss the pool already :)
"I spend 2 nights in this hotel with 2 children (5 & 0), and also with elder. All enjoyed the hotel, the food was delicious, spacious and clean room, the staffs was helpful. Definitely will back again"
"It’s a walk away from beach , the location is beautiful ! A refreshing welcome drink was offered to us when we arrived . The interiors of the hotel is stunning and classy . Rooms are spacious ,clean and the pools are cherry on top ! Hence I loved my stay here and would recommend this hotel …."
"Great hotel with nice locations (close to port for ferry to Nusa Penida). A lot of street food with great price & taste. Nice room, great breakfast, nice pool. Love it all 💕"
"Nice hotel, clean and good staff.  I would like to comeback here.  The hotel was full and the receptionist was hetic at the time but the staff are really profesional to get solution.  Thank you."
Near the beach walk and near from the harbor to NUSA Penida and also near to my favorite supermarket in Indonesia (PAPAYA)
"Pros : Strategic location, green environment, spacious room, kind staffs.
Cons : The WiFi almost non-existent in the room."
All the staff really goes above and beyond to make sure that  you have a great experience staying here. The atmosphere so calm and the facilities are well maintained. The breakfast so tasty and 1 of the best in Bali. The swimming pool is so clean and have great shade even on mid day. Special thanks to Dendi who always make sure we have a good time and putu darmawan with his skill on towel origami. We really have a great time and will be back.
We stayed at Prime plaza for just one night as a stopover before we caught the ferry to Nusa Penida. The hotel is perfectly situated just a short walk to the harbour and beach. The staff are very welcoming and provided a lovely flower arrangement and fruit plate upon our arrival.
"A superb staff, comfortable room, clean and nice"
"Good hotel, clean, and staff so friendly and humble... if you wanna go to penida island. This hotel very recomended. Because near to dermaga sanur. And also near to makbeng restaurant."
Definately wanted to go back... this should be enough to express how good this hotel was.
"It is a nice place to stay. It has a lot of facilities, beautiful swimming pool with pool bar, fitness area, spa, elegant lobby with beautiful architectural and interior design. The room Wifi is their only problem, it has poor connection and keeps on getting disconnected."
Big hotel with lots of space and facilities. Excellent breakfast!!
"Plus:
1.Close to the beach, 3 minutes walk only and they have hourly shuttle to drop us to sand beach
2.Very friendly staff
3.Breakfast is great with many choices
4. Room is comfortable, clean and complete amenities
5. Clean long pool

No complaints everything was nice!
"really big hotel. near ferry crossing to nusa penida. so if you want to cross over to penida, this hotel is the most convinient. 
it has big breakfast. spacious parking garage.  spacious room."
Great deal through Agoda. Value for money.
"Walking distance to sanur beach and the famous Warung Mak Beng, super helpful and friendly staffs. Clean and spacious room."
Our favourite hotel in Bali. Always come back for the relaxing pool and fantastic staff
"This hotel location totally so strategy, so near from Matahari Beach and that is make us easy when we plan go to Nusa Dua. Thank you for your service"
Good staf be humble 🤍🤍🤍
"great value for the money, pool was clean and nice, offer free shuttle to prime suite und sanur beach, the room is big, bathroom could have been cleaner."
"Enjoyed my stay very much. 
old school gym but with everything you need. Breakfast was amazing. Staff was super super friendly. Room was comfortable and spacious."
"A dated hotel but reasonably maintained, with this price it’s worth a stay. If you are going to the few islands the next day, it’s the most suitable hotel to stay as its only 5mins walk to the harbor."
2 times stayed here and we still love this hotel for our next stay
"Great location, great room, great facilities. Overall, it's really the best place to stay in Sanur."
to Sanur Beach and travel go to Nusa Penida
"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel:
Good:
- swimming pool
- breakfast
- gym (!!!)
- price/value
- parking
- billiard
- big inner garden
Not so good:
- you can hear your neighbors
- jacuzzi is not allowed for <15
- not directly at the sea, but it’s ok to walk 5 min"
Pool access room was great and huge breakfast selection
Convenience and love their typical style of Bali
Would not change anything the breakfast was awesome all staff were very friendly the hotel was very clean
"The location of the hotel is just perfect (near the Sanur harbour, the beach side, and food stalls), the staffs were friendly, and the outdoor facilities are nice (swimming pool and basket ball)"
"Best location for who want to nusa penida trip, only 400m from harbour"
"Good location, near famous Mak Beng. The best thing is staff are super helpful and very attentive! Keep it up!"
Clean room. Big pool! Nice gym! Private. It is the best place to stay at Sanur.
Our favourite hotel in sanur. Very comfort. We hope next time internet will be better.
"Very friendly staff,  Clean and spacious rooms, great location in Sanur."
"All good, but Agoda got me dearest price with lower device from hotel.
Sorry if I am bit disappointed mainly from the agent agoda"
"It was lovely to be able to stay here, staff was very attentive and polite.  I had great time!! Thank you"
"Stayed here for 1 night after flying in late. This hotel is right around the corner from Sanur beach where we got a boat to Nusa Lembongan. Convenient location, a decent room with air con and a buffet breakfast. Perfect for what we needed it for"
"Only 100 meters to Sanur Beach, good lobby hotel, kind of staff"
Value for money
Happy to stay here
"Check in n out process were easy, breakfast menu ok with some variety, staff also very helpful. My deluxe pool view room got upgraded to premier garden view, maybe to accomodate special request of non smoking n twin bed. Room is clean, spacious and bright. My only complain is the free-wifi, slow and unstable.  You can walk to Sanur Beach, known for its sunrise spot view"
"Kindly check your AC in your room, because its centralize and might not cool enough"
Hotel is clean and big but it is noisy from the next door project renovation
"Since we planned to go to Nusa Penida the next day, we booked a hotel near Sanur port.  The hotel is only about 10 minutes walk from the port, which is very convenient.  Although the hotel's facilities are old, the staff is very friendly and makes up for this deficiency."
Everything is great
Only stayed one night but it was great for the price.  Room was large and clean and really good.  Breakfast was a feast.  All in all a great hotel for the what you pay.
Near Sanur Beach. Delicious breakfast. Nice n big room
Old hotel with good condition after renovation
"Good Hotel, clean and very nice staff."
"I am satisfied staying here, but i got problem with the bathroom's door, its hard to close. But over all, this hotel is great."
"The place is stunning, so is the pool area. Is defiantly worth the money."
All good. Good location and the staffs are very helpful. Good choice to stay before go to Nusa Penida/Lembongan...very close to the ferry pier...
"Nice hotel with strategic area, easy to go everywhere with near access to the beach"
So far so good but the room need cleaning more cuz i’ve seen cockroaches
"Helpful staff, close to the beach, so much places to eat nearby hotel.. Amazing.."
"The staffs are friendly, although there is the unfriendly. The facilities are good, but the air conditioner at our room was not work properly.  The scenery at the hotel is beautiful. The food is good. The location is strategic that can be easily reached from Denpasar city. Me and my family often spend our night at this hotel."
The  staff were fantastic
"We needed a comfortable stay for a night, after night flight, to continue our journey by boat to Lembongan.  This hotel serves the purpose.  Room is bright and spacious.  Breakfast was also good.
Small supermarkets, cafeteria, etc., within walking distance.
Hotel is within walking distance to both Boat Operators, D'Camel and Arthamus.  However, it came to our understanding that Arthamus is a better boat operator than D'Camel, (see separate review on tripadvisor)."
"Room is not super clean especially bathroom but for the price, not too bad. Excellent service from friendly staffs"
Only good for who needs go to Sanur habour quickly
"I was in Sanur mainly for scuba diving, so I didn't spend much time at the hotel, but the facilities were good and the staff were friendly."
"My fam & I stay in Prime Plaza for three days in two rooms. The breakfast is awesome, location is near Sanur beach & Warung Mak Beng (best fish soup) I ever eat!"
Good for work or holiday. Family and kids friendly. Nice pool.
"For whom, who is looking for a little bit quiet & calm during your stay in Bali. This one is surely an option. Just a few steps from Sanur beach. A dawn beach. This place is not for after dark activities."
cozy which is anjayani
Good choice for vacations with ur family
"The hotel was generally good, but when we were staying there, the bedroom window was leaking from raining outside. Standing water is all around the bedrooms. Complaining was made to the reception desk, but the facility team only put a piece of towel on the bottom of windows frame."
Its an old and huge hotel building. Its a great place for you who wants to visit Nusa Penida by the fast boat from Sanur Harbour
This hotel location is near ferry harbour to Nusa Penida
close to sanur beach just walking distance and lots of food places
The hotel is near from Ferry harbour to Nusa Penida island
Old hotel but well maintained
Strategic location
"This hotel is already a bit older.
I like the architecture, the big pool but that's about it.
Staff, in other reviews quite often as very efficient and friendly described is friendly but I am not sure about the efficiency.
Breakfast, for example, coffee empty, juices empty, cheese empty at 9.50h.  Coffee got at least filled up after guests asked staff.
We booked a room with pool view. They gave us an upgrade to a premier room which had no pool view. They didn't tell us that, we found out when we entered the room. Nice gesture, but I guess we should have been informed. So I called the helpline and they gave us another room. Main advantage of the premier room: bigger bathroom and closer to the lobby. That's a good point since the hotel building is long. 
They moved us to the pool view, but not without giving us a room almost at the end. . In addition there are loud constructions going on next to the hotel and hammering noise all day long which we could tolerate, other people might not. 
Well, I guess that's what you get if you don't appreciate the upgrade.
We had coffee at the pool bar. It was not possible to charge the bill to the room account. We had to pay on the spot. That's so last century....
Gym is huge, as I said pool too (but none of the staff knows how long :-)
 Hotel architecture gives you a hint how nice it must have been in the first years to stay here. It's still impressive though.
Will I stay here again: no! 
Will I recommend it for one night before or after taking the ferry to Nusa Penida: yes!"
"- Could not use the internet for gmeet/zoom
- I had to ask for towel"
"Overall would say it was a nice hotel, the lobby, pool and gardens were nice. Our room’s air conditioning system wasn’t working properly but it was too late and we were too tired to request a room change. It was also small and the bathroom wasn’t in the best working condition (leaky shower head system, etc). Overall was ok but probably wouldn’t go back. Location was key though."
I am a frequent guest who always stay in the hotel. I am quite satisfied in overall.
"Pool area nice.  Breakfast was not great. First night had bugs in the bed. Manager was obliging and gave us another room.  But was supposed to be an upgrade.... few things didn't work... toilet, fridge, no overhead shower.  So don't know if I'd stay there again."
"Nice hotel, near harbour to get to nusa penida, good breakfast!"
"Good for a short stay and if you want to take the boat to nusa or gili islands. 
There was some construction going on what made lot of noise in my room, thankfully they give me a other room on the other side of the hotel.  So the service was good. 
Overall, hotel is old fashion but good for a short stay."
Utk low season bs menjadi pilihan menginap yg oke but not in high season...
Closewalking distance to beach . Close to shops and restaurants. Rooms could do with a makeover .we had pool access room but very dark and depressing because of the tall trees right outside ..would stay again
"I stayed here because i have a seminar to attend to which being held in this hotel. Compared to other hotel in Bali, this hotel seem a bit old but have a good ballroom and facilities to held a big group meeting. Breakfast are average, lunch and dinner also average. I don’t like how they give just a glass of water for a big meeting. Rooms are okay, but i kinda get one room in the end of the hall which is so far away from the lobby and ballroom. Staff are okay. Its just an adequate experince"
"Accommodation facilities are well maintained.  
A very strategic location near to Sanur Jetty by walking distance and many row of shops."
"was still waiting for our room to be confirmed at 6 o’clock that night in the end. After having conversations they finally upgraded us as they had obviously already booked out. The room we had booked  food was average service around the pool was non-existent, but the hotel itself is very nice"
Noisy  hotel
"It is usual to have some ants in the room here in Bali, but what that happened to us in this hotel was exceptional. 
One of my suitcases that was on the desk under the TV all night was full of ants in the morning we left the hotel. 
It ruined our stay in the hotel"
Nice hotel to stay
"Location is alright near Sanur Beach
Can’t complain about the price 
But the towels/floor mat have a smell 
Rooms are basic"
Too slow due to small IT load.
"The biggest problem that we had here was the WiFi. They let you use it only in three devices and it's limited to 2 mbps per device! So that's just unbelievable! If you want to pay you can up it to 4mbps, even more unbelievable. 
Room is avarage. 
The gym is good. But full of people and you have to book a time when you want to use that. You cannot use sauna or jacuzzi."
"Hi. This hotel is really not recomended.  At first i came to this hotel, the receptionist told me that my room was im 466 but then when we entered the room, the room was not ready ( the bed havent tidied, the room dirty the lamp was off and cannot be turned on, then we called the receptionist and they moved us to different room). The wifii is really bad. I even cannot connect to wifii at all. The connection is really slow. I already called the staffs but all the said is to restart my phone and they said cannot help ( ya saya tidak bisa follow up dengan wifii tidak minta maaf tidak apa) im sorry but this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed."
"Dirty, horror, creepy, room not used for maybe 3 years, totally not recommended"
They transferred us to different hotel.
"Room not nice and over price, not worthed"
"Okay you probably know this is my 6th time staying in this hotel. Something you should know. Sanur Plaza owns this medium-waterboom-like-splash swimming pool and games for family fun. It's located at Sanur Plaza Suite (not Sanur Plaza Hotel but Suite). But don't worry even if you stay at the Hotel you can ride free shuttle to the Suite and enjoy splashing-waterboom-like swimming there for free, yes free just show your hotel key and that's it. Ask the receptionist about the shuttle schedule it normally leaves from 9am and comes back 9:50 and the next ride is 10am and the next ride is 11am etc you get the point, just ask for the shuttle schedule. Also know this, the shuttle also drops you all around Sanur at specific location so its a great way to plan your day.  They also let you drop off at Kuta for free but coming back to hotel you'll have to manage on your own like taxi.  Do you really need me to explain the hotel room condition? I've been talking about them already so just look up (hint: you won't be disappointed staying here). Another tip: make sure you don't end up with higher-number room as you will have to have a long walk down waaaay down the hall...my room number 239 it took me 4 min walk from room to lobby something like 100 foot steps so you get the idea how far it is)."
"Sanur Paradise Plaza Hotel is wonderful for families with kids looking for good value hotel.  Walk straight out the door and you can wonder to the beach which has a great walkway along the beach with shaded areas whilst shopping, eating out along the water or watching the kids play in the sand or water(no major waves usually!)or like we did take your free shuttle or taxi from hotel $3 aud over to the lovely play area at the sister hotel 3 minutes away and the kids can go crazy on the water slide or play in the lovely garden area which is shaded and set up perfect for kids up to 12 years old but especially good for little ones  up to 8years old.  We just stayed a week ago with a 2 and 5 year old and they loved it.  Our five year old all ok on the slide(its not too big but not too small either)and also not like they will get lost in the crowd like larger slide areas. Very easy to supervise them too!There is an undercover shaded area by the pool and if your little one can swim easy to monitor from there as can see all the pool and very close. Also back at your hotel they have a fab gym and classes included and great buffet breakfast.  This hotel is popular with locals too. 
Sanur I feel is a great alternative to Kuta particularly with little kids with not being so crowded and busy and more shaded though the older ones may prefer the bigger waves and excitement of Kuta/Seminyak.  Sanur has loads of shops, so easy to walk around with kids yet easy to get to Ubud/Kuta/Nusa Dua for days trips.  Shuttle from hotel can you take you to the supermarket for all your supplies loads of supplies like milk etc for kids too or you can walk out the back door of the sister hotel and its 5 mins walk easy!  All the staff were wonderful too had a can do attitude!"
"Internal, secluded swimming pool with lush vegetation gives comfort in windless, relaxing privacy. The main restaurant (Sanur Harum) provides with excellent quality, value-for-money meals. All staff is very friendly and helpful. We look forward to our next Bali holiday at Prime Plaza Hotel in Sanur."
"We received a discount on our stay at Prime Plaza Hotel Sanur (last minute booking), and hence the hotel was excellent value for money.  The hotel staff are incredible - super helpful and always friendly.  Our rooms were lovely and spacious, the swimming pool was great, and the facilities excellent.  Would certainly recommend this hotel."
"This is nice hotel, near Sanur beach (just 5-10 min walk)... with so many free air & green garden... My twin room was spacious... all staff were friendly... 
Breakfast are standard . So may places to eat around the hotel...  it’s easy too to find “warungMak Beng”... where you can eat traditional deluvious Indonesian food..
I wil back again to stay at Prime Plaza hotel.."
"The hotel pick up at the airport went smoothly. When I checked in, I was upgraded free of charge from Standard to Premier room, which I appreciate it very much. When I entered my room for the first time, the hotel staff gave me a big suprise, which is a chocolate birthday cake! The staff including the security guards and drivers are so friendly and helpful. They also remember me by name. The location is very close to the beach (only 5-10 minutes walking distance). You can find streets vendors and spa shops for massage, fish spa, facial, nail, etc along the street. The hotel provides a shuttle bus almost at every hour from the hotel to  around Sanur area for free. I also stopped by at Sanur Paradise Plaza Suite, the hotel's sister company and basically you can use the facilities there for free, too! The buffet breakfast selections were awesome and they changed the menu everyday. The room service food was all good. Easy to get a taxi. If you don't want to use a hotel's taxi, you can find taxi drivers with minivan as soon as you walk out of the hotel. I used the outside of the hotel taxi driver for 6 hours to take me around Kuta area from 6 pm to 12 pm for only $35."
"We stayed at Paradise Plaza, Sanur, due to its location, as we were heading to Gili Trewangan and it was close to the seaport. It is also close enough to Kuta, Seminyak etc but far enough away to avoid the real hustle. We liked the hotel and really liked our room. I got a one hour massage just down the road from the hotel & it cost me $6 Aust.(unbelievable value; great massage) and the restaurants around the hotel served great food at cheap prices too. The Sanur beach was a bit dirty and we didn't swim there, nor in the hotel pool which looks beautiful but isn't deep enough for adults. The breakfasts were great, we got free internet in our room and overall ambience was nice."
"The Sanur Paradise Plaza Hotel was excellent for it's proximity to Pandang Bai with access to Gili Air and also Nusa Lembongan. I arranged an airport pick up directly through the Hotel and this was very efficient. The room was clean and well furnished and serviced. Lovely fresh linen!
It is a Go Green Hotel. The facilities are amazing as it is designed for the corporate stayer.
An excellent breakfast. Food and juices are excellent. A great and very clean pool.
Every evening there is live entertainment.
 It was a very qiet location but still adjacent to to all businesses. A shuttle bus is provided to take you to the shops in Sanur and to the beach club.
A wonderful place to stay."
"We had a great time at Sanur Paradise Plaza Hotel The staff were very friendly and attentive. The decor was pleasantly Balinese. The rooms were clean and in good conditon. We were also pleased to discover that we could watch television from several European countries! We had breakfast every morning at Sanur Harun where the selection of food was varied and plentyful. We reccommend the Komodo restaurant where we dined twice, the food was very good, the entertaiment eccellent and the staff very helpful. 
We would definately reccommend this hotel to our friends."
"staff were so helpful and couldn't do enough for us, always had a welcoming smile. our room was right by the pool and although it was close to the hustle and bustle of everything, the atmosphere from sanur paradise plaza hotel was beautiful and relaxed. loved the professional service and the little touches made by the staff. our first night we pulled up to the hotel with two people playing music and we were handed welcome drinks. there is a few different restaurants and bar areas and a gym/massage area. a mini grocery store is conveniently located next door. we have travelled all over the world and this is our favourite hotel. home away from home, perfect!!!! wish we had stayed longer here and would give it 10 out of 10."
This is my 3rd stay in Bali and 2nd stay in sanur area but my first stay in sanur paradise plaza hotel. The first welcome was very warm. The staff were friendly. Check in was very fast and smooth. The room is large spacious. The rooms need refurbishment. The long corridor is very tiring to walk. thanks my room was near to lobby. The open lobby beside the garden is gives homely feeling. my first relaxing breakfast was beside the pool. The hotel is located in a road junction beside a golf course. Good for connectivity and tranquility lovers.Not good for fun and night life. beach is 5 min walk down the road. The room service is excellent with in 5-10 min.
"This a good family hotel with resort-like facilities. Good dining options, close to Sanur beach, airport and shopping areas. Good activities for children, wonderful spa (reasonable rates), shuttle service to beach club and shopping area. Easy availability of transport. Sanur turned out to be a good choice area for family as quiet with good beach and all facilites for watersport. the beach is 10-15 minutes walk from the hotel, but shuttle is available to the beach club. Staff is friendly, courteous and warm.
I hired a local driver by name Wayan +6281338732109, very safe and knowledgeble and took us around to all major attractions in bali (ubud, kintamani, bratan lake, tanah lot, uluwatu)."
"arrived at hotel about 1600 hrs on 20.1.13. was greeted warmly by the porter. handed my voucher to reception. she efficiently took care of my booking. i requested to look at a quiet and suitably located room. she explained the added charges for balcony room facing gardens and swimming pool.ok with me.in the end i settled for room number 168 1st floor west wing. fyi lobby is on 2nd floor. room was newly refurbished with soothing paintwork and absolutely clean. for these i actually have to add another per night which is great value for money. closeness to the breakfast dining area make it so much the better.i can smoke my evening cigar at the balcony with beautiful garden view. it was memorable. i have read many previous reviews, bottom line it depends on what you want from your holiday. overall my wife and i enjoyed our short stay at sanur paradise plaza hotel."
"Our stay at Sanur Paradise Plaza Hotel was very relaxing and nothing we requested was too much effort for them to supply to us. The hotel Shuttle Bus was a fun experience for all who took part in it. The staff are all so friendly and accomodating. The hotel has taken heed of an earlier suggestion  from us to install a ladder into the pool area. It has made our entry and exit to the pool so much easier, as myself and my son are a little disabled and not able to manage the big steps at poolside. A big thankyou to management for that."
"Our stay at Sanur Paradise Plaza Hotel is a pleasant one. The staff are friendly and the decoration is very Balinese style which we like very much. I must commend on their variety of food on their room service menu which is available almost round the clock. The food is delicious and very affordable (12USD / pax) considering that its room service. The hotel also provide transport to all parts of Bali at reasonable rates. Moreover, shuttle service to selected parts of Sanur is free.

However, there is no aircondition in the lobby and the Spa treatment is pretty expensive. There are not many restaurants or other amenities around the hotel as well."
Our first time in Bali and we were recommended this hotel to stay at as a good place to relax and become used to the new culture. It was a terrific experience and the slightly more low-key nature of Sanur along with the hotel shuttle bus and friendly staff meant we felt safe and in control straight away. The tropical surrounds and pool layout were fun to enjoy and the rooms were first rate.
"I stayed at Sanur Paradise Hotel for one night and it was a nice experience though I travelled alone!! if I had known it was a nice place to stay at, I would have booked and stayed at Sanur Paradise from the first time I arrived in Bali (4 days before I checked at 4 July. I had my last minute booking...thanks Agoda.
The check-in process was easy although when I arrived at the FO my hotel confirm booking email was not delivered yet but the lady with full of smiles was very nice and helpful.
I spent my last day swimming at the lovely pool, enjoying myself there after my huge breakfast! Yes, Huge! we can find various food, oriental and international.
The bedroom is comfortable though not too spacious but it is lovely just to spend the whole day in the room.

Compare to the service and the place, I don't think it is an expensive hotel. The price is equal to its facilities.
I think I will be back to this hotel and of course via Agoda booking service."
This was a great place to stay. We brought our nephews to the kids club at the sister hotel Plaza suites. The breakfast buffet was yummy and it was nice and relaxing by the pool.  I would definitely stay here next time I come. It was at the end of Sanur beach- so it was a bit of a walk to the beach restaurants.  Staff were very friendly and the room was clean!  No issues at all on our stay :)
"Browsing around the internet for a hotel in Bali and found Sanur Paradise with a good reasonable price compare to other hotels.
The hotel is in good location which is easy to find. Greeted by friendly staff and also helpful. The hotel room was clean. Pool was also nice. Should try the outdoor massage next time."
"My friend and me spent 3 days in Bali and we enjoyed the stay at the hotel. It's in walking distance to the beach and there's a bus stop near by. 

We used the pool, drank at the bar, did a spa there, and took their shuttles to a traditional shopping mall and another part of Sanur Beach. Everything is good. They also provide printing service."
I would recommend this hotel 👍👍👍
