"Such a beautiful place!! I was surprised how cheap a night there is when I saw the place in person. It looks like a mini resort! The staff were friendly, the food was good and the bungalow was clean and the yard is just extraordinary!!
Highly recommend!"
"A beautifully maintained and tranquil accomodation in a quiet area of Balangan. Accomodation  was simple, but clean and comfortable. We paid the extra for air conditioned bungalow which is worth doing as it gets very hot! The staff were really lovely and helpful and advised on things to do etc when asked.  We ate at the restaurant one night and the food was delicious and reasonable (be aware that all restaurants etc add on 15% tax and then service of 5%) we wasn't aware of this before but just be mindful if you are on a budget) The breakfast was simple choices but adequate and you could also choose to have eggs in addition  to the choices of fresh fruit, juices,  local dishes normally nasi goreng or noodles (different daily) coffee/tea fresh bread/cake. Make sure to take plenty of repellent.  I found the mosquitoes a problem for me due to the amount of rainfall they seemed to be rife. Best to be prepared. Noisy cockerels at 3.45 am so take earplugs if light sleeper! hire a scooter !"
"I love everything about this place. It's quiet, neat and love the amenities specially the pool because it's warm! We love to swim at night so my friend and I really enjoyed it."
"We loved our stay here. Ambience is amazing and all the staff is super helpful and friendly. Special shoutout to Aayu, Puttu and Kadek, they helped us alot and made our stay more memorable.
Definitely recommending this place."
"I had a wonderful stay here,  the pool is lovely, the bungalows and outdoor shower are fantastic. Please mind that this is a family oriented place and there are a lot of children staying here - if like me that’s an issue for you I would reconsider booking. Apart from that 10/10!"
Beautiful place. The staff is great.
"It is a nice place for a stay. It is very quiet and secluded so you need a scooter to get around (staff can help with that). Nice pool, nice staff and clean bungalows."
"It was exactly what we were looking for, peace and quiet! Staff was great!! We definitely recommend!"
Price is good bungalow are so nice with the bathroom outside it’s such a nice feeling ! Massages are super good too and pool very warm !
"Loved our stay 
The receptionist was v nice in acquiring a strong fan for us which is necessary if you want a cooler night 🌸💕"
"The stay was one of the best places I stayed in, in Bali. Love the staff they are so nice, the shower was so cute and the place was so relaxing"
Nice rustic villa with a good restaurant and pool. Location is close to the beach though not close to much of anything else (make sure you have your own transport—driver/scooter ready ). The outdoor shower and toilet were clean and feel like living in your own secluded piece of paradise. Amazing value for the money
"Great place, helpful staff, not too far from the beach! Really like the trees and flowers all over the place. Clean and peaceful place!"
"Beautiful Balinese bungalows, walking distance to Balangan for great surf, and 20 minutes drive/30 minutes bike ride to two other nice beaches. It is quite isolated from the rest or Bali, so it’s for peace and quiet not for party/social."
"The bungalows look lovely and the garden too. The breakfast was delicious. The outdoor bathroom needs a renovation and there should be more focus on clean bedsheets. As the roof is made from natural materials there will always fall stuff on your bed like dust and bugs, especially when there is wind outside. They should cover the top of the beds with a plastic or something, otherwise you have that stuff in your face and hair each morning."
We’ve never experienced this type of accomodation but loved every single detail and our stay. No aircon but it gets quite cool at night and the fans were sufficient. Open living so bring mosquito spray. In private location so grab not allowed to pick you up. Live band there was great. Vibes were so relaxing and we had a great time and stay. Thank you for the experience. We recommend this for sure.
Great friendly and helpful staff. A cozy environment with tranquility and a good ambiance. It was very relaxing to stay here
"The bungalows are really beautiful and a great place to stay if you like staying close to the nature. 
Only the restaurant I cannot recommend. Me and my friend both felt sick after dinner. But there are lovely places around, especially close to the beach."
Great value for money! The staff were very helpful and so friendly! Would happily stay again.
"Helpful and friendly staff. Close to the Balangan beach. Quiet and calm area. A bit far from other spots, so if you want to explore the region a bit more, it's better to have a scooter."
"If you're looking for an isolated, authentic getaway, look no further. 
The staff is super kind. Beach is very close and surf is powerful (beware of rocks)."
Walking distance (5 min) to the cliff where you can enjoy the view to open sea.. most of the visitors are chasing sunset.
"A good place with reasonable price. There was some missing in our room show that they did not provide professional service: no towel in room when I checked in (I have to ask the staff to provide), hot water not really worked, very noisy in the mid-night as neighbors held a poolparty.  However, this is still a good place for 1 day rest with beach, diner nearby, friendly staffs, accoustic music night at the internal restaurant..."
Was extremely hot in the night even though it was cold and rainy that night. There is a ceiling fan in the room but did not really help much. Rooms looks pretty and gives you a forest-retreat sort of feeling. There was no hot water which was quite surprising for the amount of money I paid for the room. Food on the other hand was extremely pricey and did not live up to its pricing.
"Beautiful surrounding, clean, confortable, amazing, will be back!"
"Comfy and cute stay. Very pretty individual bungalows. Good WiFi and lovely staff.
The bathroom is outside (but I quite liked this). No air on but did have celing tan and standing fan. Overall nice stay"
"This was perfect for me, super cosy and just easy! It was beautiful and very authentic. Awesome for solo travel or wanting a cheap stay you definitely get your moneys worth here!!!"
Very natural room. There was no air conditioner but wasn't too hot. Walking distance to a nice balangan surfing beach
It is a very calm place in the middle of the jungle. It is close to the beach but the area is very calm if u want to have party. If u want to do surf it is just 5 minutes walking.
"We stayed many times in flowerbud, very good location for surf, helpful & friendly staff, copious breakfast, good food overall for reasonable price.
Only thing needs to improve is pillow, time to change to new ones (it smells bad).
We definitely  recommend this resort and will come back."
"Decent room, nicely designed  but  lots of mosquitoes & no AC was quite uncomfortable. Also abit far from everything except the surfer beach berangan with few good eating spots"
"Very cozy place, really pretty at night. Friendly staff that helped us out when our booking was not approved through Agoda. Maybe it says it self since it is a bungalow, but the sheets was not clean and there were small insects in the bed. Location was really good, close to the beach and you could do yoga at another hotel that was maybe 80 meters away."
"Overpriced, small space for 2 people in hut that is supposed to be for 4 people plus bad lighting inside the hut. The staff were bad at problem solving and wasn’t very accommodating."
it was nice to stay. cute dog stays with us
"Staff was friendly. Resto was under renovation. Money went missing from the room during cleaning. The wi-fi was terrible. Lovely bungalows though, but make sure you get a bungalow with a/c when booking. Nice and relaxing vacation spot, but not many dining options nearby."
"If you were to believe the photos on the website then I think you will be disappointed.  It’s us very much in the older traditional style and nice in that regard…. But it’s tired.  Staff were friendly enough but not around very much.  The family room we stayed in had seen better days for sure.  Just need a bit of a spruce up and some time spent on the grounds will do a world of good.  Breakfast was the only meal available in the restaurant, but with few options locally it meant a bit of a scoot into Padang Padang or Uluwatu for a decent feed.  No dramas really. 
 Fantastic location, really close to the beach.  Surf everyday and good cheap earrings right at the waters edge.  If you are in a budget and can get a good deal on this place it’s a win for sure, just don’t expect to many creature comforts"
"We stayed for two nights in flower bud 1 mid June 2022.
Short story: The place must have been really nice pre-covid, unfortunately post-covid it's left in decay. We felt that the price was to high for the service.
The bad:
The power went off couple of times in the night, which I had to fix myself.
The bed kept sagging and cracking until eventually touched the floor.
The fan broke at certain points
... This was our first night..
The next day we switched bungalow, which was better. The only thing missing was the hot water.
Other things to mention:
The pool area was not really maintained.
Only local drivers are allowed in the area, so prepare big bucks for transportation, as there is not much to do around.
The good:
It is pretty even poorly maintained.
The beach is next door."
"Huts are very cute but we have up one night stay because we could sleep.  The local roosters are extremely loud and call every 2-30 seconds from 4 am until 11am. Not the owner fault but definitely a thumbs down.  Good points.  Hot water,  coffee making,  very sweet huts. Bed firm but OK. Lovely staff."
"Not as advertised, unfortunately. Bad value for money and nicer places to stay at in Uluwatu as that particular area is generally run down. Staff were friendly, but ended up losing the packing we used for our new surf board after we requested not to throw it away. The mosquito nets didnt really work at all and if you get a bungalow with the top and bottom section you can forget sleeping at the top because of the heat trapped in the bungalow. Would not recommend."
Staff were rude and not helpful. It is a very basic shack. We were in flower bud 2 which is less maintained that flower bud 1. It is a little bit off the beaten track.
I actually filled a claim for refund and left the place the next morning. Extremely dirty smelly sheets and towers. The bathroom floor has mold and the rooms as well. I couldn’t breath and got sick the first night . I left next morning although I had another paid night. The original  bungalow had no fan or AC. Contacted Agoda no resolution for refund yet.
"Room was not ready and we waited almost 1 hour to check in. 
Shower space was flooded.
Staff not proactive helping things"
"The rooms are full of millepedes. 
I booked a superior room, and got to know after reaching there that there is no ac. The fan is placed away from the bed. So it was very hot. 
Damp lighting. Open bathrooms with full view for the tenants in the nearby apartments."
"This place made me love Bali. It was super-comfortable, really close to the beach and the people working there were really friendly. The first night I stayed at Flower Bud 1, which was much prettier than 2 because it had the pool and cafe and was a bit closer to the beach. So at first I was a bit gutted to be moved to Flower Bud 2, but it turned out to be a good thing because it was much quieter (except for those damn cockrels) and as these bungalows were the smaller ones there were no kids around. I have nothing bad to say about the place and I can't wait to go back as soon as possible."
"I stayed for one night in a Superior Bungalow (sleeps 2) at Flower Bud 2. The accommodation is basic - hut style bungalow with outdoor toilet & shower and ceiling fan (no AC), but it's perfectly adequate, well-kept and clean. 
The best things about this place are:
1) Location - it's super close to Balangan Beach and it's tucked away in it's own peaceful and secluded spot so it's a very relaxing place to be. 
2) Food at the restaurant - the buffet breakfast is really good and so is the food on the a la carts menu. I had the seafood mixed grill and the chicken in coconut curry - both were excellent and very generous portions. My friend had the chicken satay skewers, which were also great!
The staff are also friendly and helpful and you can rent scooters directly from the villa. 
I would recommend this place and would return myself for sure!"
"We loved it. Being our first time in Bali we had no idea what to expect and after arriving after midnight and being unable to find our booking with security, they found us a room and were very friendly and helpful in Flower Bud 1 . The next morning we were given breakfast and then checked out where we were supposed to be in Flower Bud 2 which was quieter ( due to maintenance at FB1) and no families staying , even though it was a short walk further to the beach, so we moved to our room. Had al fabulous time there and an amazing massage by the pool. Highly recommend the place and definitely recommend grabbing a taxi to Jimbaran beach for the beach seafood restaurants!,"
"We loved our time at Flower Bud. The restaurant food was the most flavorful of all we ate in our two weeks in Bali and the islands. The staff were so friendly and sweet. Ketut, one of the taxi drivers linked to the guest house, drive us where we needed to go. The beach is in walking distance, but our kids loved the hotel pool which was sIt was a fabulous experience there!!"
"Our 3 boys, my husband and I had a lovely time here at Flower Bud. It is set in a tranquil lush garden, walking distance to the beach where my husband could go surf. Breakfast was abundant, massages were available under a shelter not far fron the pool and were very good, the staff friendly and the bungalows were perfect for the 5 of us."
"If you're looking for a quite secluded place to stay, Flower Bud is probably worth consideration. However, the place is sooo secluded, there are nothing, and I mean nothing within a mile radius. Having your own transport is extremely important in Flower Bud, because you may have to travel for miles to the ""closest"" point of interest.
Good points of Flower Bud, is probably the super helpful and friendly staffs. And clean comfortably bed. Bungalow is very nice looking traditional bamboo cottage, look really lovely.
Some negative points of Flower Bud.
Flower Bud is located in an undeveloped part of Bali, Western Jimbaran. You'll be driving on super bumpy narrow dirt road, with a dry and barren surrounding views.
Hotel restaurant's menu is average and small portion. Also greatly overpriced, for the amount and type of food.
Bungalow floor can be quite dusty and dirty. You are recommended to wear footwear all the time even inside your own bangalow.
The BIGGEST drawback of Flower Bud is, at nighttime there are DOZENS of feral dogs in the nearby empty land that bark and howl all night long, even past midnight.
Flower Bud presents itself as a luxury 5 star ""resort"" but the location of the hotel dictates otherwise. If you're looking for a nice quite holiday, look else where."
"The bungalow was extremely close to Balangan Beach (less than 5 minute walk), and motor bike rental was available from the property for 70,000 IDR a day if you wanted to venture into Uluwatu or neighbouring areas. The room contained all the amenities we needed during our stay, and was extremely picturesque to look at. We especially loved the outdoor terrace area to chill and it was also cleaned daily. The breakfast provided a good range of options, along with the dinner menu at the hotels restaurant too. The pool area was also clean and well kept. The staff were all always very friendly and welcoming, and couldn't be more helpful to any questions we had.
We do recommend if you are visiting this hotel and the area in general to make sure you have a good supply of mosquito repellent, as this was our only issue - especially with the outdoor bathroom facilities. The hotel did make an effort to tackle this with nets and mosquito fogging during our stay."
"We enjoyed two nights at the Flower Bud Bungalows. Having read the reviews before booking we knew the rooms would not be air conditioned, mosquitoes could be a problem, and rain might be an issue with the outdoor bathrooms.  All these things were correct, but did not in anyway spoil the chilled out experience of this place. We enjoyed the simple toast and fruit for breakfast and the pool was great. It is just a short walk to the beach which has a good choice of wooden shacks to have a Bintang and watch the surfers.  A couple of night at Flower Bud was about the perfect length of time for us here."
"It was magnificent. I felt totally relaxed, happy and contented at Flower Bud 2. The beautiful surroundings with a cockerel crowing and gentle breeze was just perfect. The staff are all so friendly and helpful. The food was good and when I wanted a hotter nasi goreng, the cook was pleased to oblige. The pool is great and the outdoor massage area, a real treat.I love the 'outdoor' bathrooms but it can be a bit cold when you shower at night, with no hot water and the wind is blowing. Nevertheless, I am definitely coming back! Thank you so much for a lovely stay!"
"We actually got bumped up to Brother's Bungalows (Balangan). The room was a bit nicer, but the balcony wasn't as nice. Staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The food isn't the best, if you're looking for local meals (western food, mostly with a few indo-staple meals). Surf beaches as far as Balangan goes: very rocky, fairly large waves and a strong current / riptide. Lots of places to walk around to and getting to town is easy. Uluwatu, Padang Padang and Jimbaran are all great spots to check out, up and down the coast (rent a skooter for ~$6 US / day). Jimbaran was our favourite beach (for the food and for the swimming)."
"We can't recommend Flower Bud enough! The room was beautiful, staff helpful and the pool and gardens we're so peaceful. The food was also amazing. Just what we needed!"
"A stay in this area of Bali is very relaxing and perfect for beach goers like us. It is very isolated and quiet compared to other parts of Bali. Balangan beach is 3 minutes walk away and paradise. It's clean and there are a number of restaurants to eat breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. When the tide is in the kids played in the waves. When the tide went out they spent hours looking for sea creatures on the reef. The bungalows are comfortable, breakfast was good and the staff were friendly and helpful."
"This is actually a review of Flowerbud 2, not Flowerbud 1. Anyway, I can't recommend this place enough. It's a very quiet location but only a few minutes walk to the lovely Balangan beach (tip: go out of the rear door by the restaurant - it's much quicker!). Gede and his staff could not have been more helpful and lovely. Tours and transport are easily arranged. The grounds are very peaceful and are kept to a high standard. The individual thatched bungalows are really nice with great balconies, with the bathrooms in a little outdoor courtyard - nice! The staff really go the extra mile in their attention to detail, even putting mozzie coils out both on the balcony and in the bathroom in the evening. The free breakfast buffet is really very good and the rest of the food is delicious - a good thing as there are no other non-resort places to eat in the vicinity apart from the beach warnings. A great place to stay for a few days and just relax... a little piece of paradise!"
"Beautiful gardens, cabins airy, welcoming staff, adorable dog, 4 mins to beach and plenty Wyrongs...big surf, quaint roads for scootering. Overall loved our stay at Flower Bud 2..very chilled. Cons...wet season may be mosquitoes but hotel do fog and put coils in room with nets.."
We stayed for 2 nights looking to be close to the beach with access to Jimbaran and Ulluwatu. We hired a motorbike through the hotel. It's about 10 minutes to the main road between Jimbaran and Ulluwatu. Bingalan Beach is approx. 10 minutes walk from Flower Bud Bungalow 2 (Flower Bud 1 is closer). The bungalows are traditional Bali style and are fairly basic. Dark wood inside and gloomy lighting makes the room pretty dark. There are lots of windows to open though. Each has a nice porch with a day bed and table and chairs. The bed was a bit hot - the plastic mosquito net didn't help - be nicer if it was fabric. Breakfast was fine and the location overlooking the pool and garden is lovely. the staff were very helpful.
"I enjoyed by stay in Bali so much! The bungalows were very comfortable and clean. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Beach is a short walk away but the pool is also fantastic. If you're interested in clubbing, you're a little far away but would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking to relax by the water or surf."
"Far from the Bali night clubbing/Bogan scene of Kuta. Great bungalows with outdoor bathroom and big comfy beds. Good breakfast included and lovely pool and garden. Our family of five, kids 14, 11 and 9 day ‘relaxing, good service and fun’"
"No Air con rooms but you don’t even feel it. Super clean and nice staff. Good mixture of European and Bali breakfast. Nice place to site around pool. Very quite, good for chill out, location next to the best beach in the area, next to top viewing point. Weaknesses - little annoying system of closing the door, only cold/medium warm water under the shower and lack of any store open late nearby. But you can buy eg beer at place at same price elsewhere, so good to stay in. Totally recommend!!"
"We had such a great time at flowerbud!! It started out tricky cos we arrived late at night from our flight, and the only staff that was around was a security guard who couldn't speak much English and we figured out they had double booked our room. We eventually got into a room and had to love from flowerbud 1 to flowerbud 2 the next day, but once this was sorted we had no more problems. Balangan Beach (2 minute walk from flowerbud) is absolutely beautiful for looks, relaxing, and surfing. Food/drinks and deck chairs readily available, and we didn't get hassled by anyone on the beach. Flowerbud itself is presented beautifully with lush gardens, authentic open-air bungalows and private outdoor garden bathrooms. The pool, massage and restaurant were all very nice as well, clean, neat, relaxing. Staff were friendly, and provided excellent service. Taxis were easy to arrange from flowerbud so it didn't feel too rural, thought it did have an 'out- of-the-way' atmosphere with quiet surroundings and friendly locals."
We travelled all over Bali and this was our favourite location. It was nice and relaxing in the traditional bungalows and was complimented nicely with great surf. I will definitely stay there again
"Stayed at flower bud 1 closer to the beach then flower bud 2 
Stayed in a room with just a fan it was pleasant enough"
Have no idea. My visa got rejected and sent back. They didn't allow refund
"Only problem is the rooms are Non AC.
Open shower looking the sky was awesome. Very very close to the famous Balangan beach and cliff. Just a walkable distance."
"Villa has no a/c but comfortable.  No mosquitoes during our stay.  Staffs were helpful and kind.  If you are not planning to see sights and want to just chill and watch surfers, this is a good place. They have a very clean pool."
"I'd rather breathe country air, live in tropical weather, eat variety's of salads, smoothies, sweet service, cheap bills, artworks, peaceful coastal surfing community respect, garden artists, timber tradesman with hand crafted industrial design gifts, getting appetite in smoke sun and forest environments with quality chicken treat bbq maddness!  Jalan Jalan"
I loved everything about my stay at Flower Bud. It was 2 weeks of Bliss.
"We liked this place so much we came back, the bungalows are beautiful, staff is kind and very peacul location. 5 min walk to the beach. Great for surfers. Nice garden the relax in. Nice pool too. There is no strong fan but this was no porblem for us. Good wifi too, strong and fast. Good for video calling."
"did not really like this hotel, went to swissbel report just before, not located very far, and for around the same price the quality of the room/hotel was way better"
"The place it self was okay and the staff helpful. The neighbour had very noisy dogs, barking all the time, and a lot of chickens that woke me up at 4 in the morning every day."
"We stayed one night in Flower Bud 1, then one night in Flower Bud 2.  Flower Bud 2 is newer, cleaner, and great if you don't need small things like aircon or a hook to hang clothes or towels on, anywhere, not even in the bathroom.  However, our bungalow at Flower Bud 1 had a serious mouse problem.  We counted four mice as they noisily kept us awake at night, as we protected our bags from them.  Staff apologized sincerely, but words seemed insufficient.  We had paid for a room suitable for sleeping, and Flower Bud 1 failed to provide what we paid for, knowingly, without an offer of any compensation, even breakfast after our long, uncomfortable, sleepless night.  I pitied the guests who moved into that bungalow after our departure.  Recommendation:  Specify Flower Bud 2, or stay elsewhere."
"Stayed first night in Flower Bud 1, then second night in Flower Bud 2.  Flower Bud 2 is newer, cleaner, and great if you don't need small things like aircon or even a single hook to hang something from, even in the bathroom.  However ... our bungalow in Flower Bud 1 had a serious mouse problem.  We counted four mice as they noisily kept us awake"
It's like you walk into heaven. The resort is so beautiful and gives jungle vibes and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  There was a live singer on Thursday which was really nice. The pool area is super niceThey also rent scooters. THE BEST MASSAGE in my life was at Flower Bud in their spa by the pool.
"A nice introduction to Uluwatu. A traditional paradise. Fantastic hospitality, delicious local dinner, clean, helpful staff. A half an hr scooter ride to town :)"
Flower Bud was the best choice I could have made. I truly enjoyed my stay.
"I spent 2 nights here with my friends during Nyepi Day and it was a unique experience. Our bungalow is small but cozy, we like the layout of the rooms. Food was great although we would prefer to be informed earlier before the check-in about the menu. Location is amazing, it's just couple minutes away from Balangan Beach."
Pool and Restaurant are great. The Bungalows are in a lovely garden and its the best place to relax
"The room was very small , felt a bit squished in it and no air conditioning was a killer , staff was really nice and was only a five min walk to beach was also okay 
All in all it was a decent stay"
I loved it!! Beautiful place and the staff are great.
"Just perfect! The rooms were good, had a netting around the bed to avoid mosquitoes. Bathroom was outside but we loved it,  very clean and tidy. The pool was very very nice. Outside the hut you have a space to chill and hand wet clothes. Loved everything about it.. Wished we booked longer but it was already sold out so deffo book atleast 3 nights. 
- one minus there wasnt much of food or shops around so eat at the resturant at the resort"
We liked it a lot!
"From the get go when we arrived, the staff at bungalow 2 was nice but because we stayed at bungalow 1 were directed there instead. When we arrived at bungalow 1, welcoming staff was not friendly at all. Although he did helped with the bags, but his face was rather sour and the other staff standing from a far was not a good sight either. I mean for us whom travelled after mount agung hike, we just need a good rest with at least feel welcomed. Other than that we were okay. Even during checkout also the same, staff was  not friendly and I did observe was only friendly towards westerners instead of us asian looking. Please improve as customer service in hotel is rather important doesn't matter what your ethnicity is!"
"Rooms are good but a bit small, the amenities provided are less compared to different hotels, open bathroom concept is very good and provides a new experience but the cleanliness of the bathroom needs to be looked upon, different insects and the walls of the bathrooms needs maintenance, rest all is very well managed"
"A great surf spot, beautiful, good food kind people."
We stayed here for 3 nights and we loved it. The bungalow was well maintained and the garden is beautiful. It’s very calm there and the pool is great. Like a little paradise. Your a few minutes walk away from the beach where you can surf. The staff is kind a offered a welcome drink. They clean the room every day.  WiFi is very good. Best place to relax and work. We are coming back.
"I stayed in Flowerbud for 3 days 2 nights and it was amazing. I made really good friends with the staffs, especially Ayu, she was amazing and really helpful throughout my stay. If you are looking for Balinese authenticity then this is the place to book. Its value for money and exceptional. Location wise its far from uluwatu town but that’s the whole point of it, but even so, there’s always go ride or scooter to rent."
Beautiful Bungalows friendly staff good food definitely staying here when I’m in Bali A+
"Pool was so nice, everything was clean, friendly staff, very instagrammable bathrooms, and close to the beach, already planning my trip back"
"Nice bed & staff.
Not much hot water in shower.
good WiFi 😆"
All nice
"calm and relaxing place to stay,food is great and staff go well beyond for you.mozzies were terrible this time,but its that time of the year.love the nice pool with nice soft music playing."
"Lovely place to stay, peaceful area but too far from markets, shops etc we felt totally cut off from everywhere and everything 
The bungalows are really nice loved the outdoor bathroom the accommodation was quirky and quaint!
Staff were polite but not over friendly we didn’t feel special in any way
Other guests had no consideration for other folk on holiday, children were unruly, loud and disrespectful, we had three different families in the bungalow next to us during our stay and each and everyone of them spoilt our vacation with arguments kids shouting and generally being inconsiderate!
The breakfast was ok but the same thing everyday buffet style if there were enough guests staying if not it was order off the menu - we found this a little strange!
The beach was not the best but ok if you wanted to surf
Although this is a nice place and by the ocean beware because it really is quite remote
We wouldn’t choose this area again"
"I stayed 6 nights by myself in the cold water bungalow (water was never really cold).
I felt welcomed from the moment I arrived, the staff was always very kind and lovely.
This was a place I did not want to leave, I really loved my stay and cannot wait to come back."
"Stylish quiet place in the countryside. Clean with friendly staff. 
A few minutes walk from the beach. Scooter rental is available on site so it's easy to visit nearby attractions.Perfect place to relax by a pool away from the crowd.
The outdoor bathroom is a cool add on to room decor."
Room was ok but the shower was crap. Not too much to do in the area. Pool was nice. Dogs barked all night long followed by roosters crowing and cats fighting.
"Cute huts in lush garden. Nice pool, great food and staff were lovely and helpful. 5 mins walk to Balangan beach to surf, swim or eat at the beach warungs."
"The teenagers had a room of their own,. The Flowerbud doesn’t attract the surfing crowd so it’s quiet and peaceful. Pool is great and live music and bbq night was really terrific."
"Beautiful place. The only thing that could do with mild improvement is the food. The resort is on the quieter side of UluWatu - great for surfers. If you want to visit the busier areas, you would need to take a taxi or scooter. We loved it though!"
"Great value for the money, the staff was beyond helpful during our short stay recommending places we should go and what to do during the time we had. The bungalows were in a private area close to a nice beach area. The only issue was that the fan did not make our room hot so the windows needed to be opened (which is why they have a mosquito net) overall i would say it was an amazing experience"
Amazing place and amazing staff.
The price I booked for on Agoda when I got there I was asked to pay more. The repose was agoda was wrong and that my booking was done through booking .com. I was very annoyed as it was and extra $50USD
Beautiful resort with lovely bungalows and a nice pool. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is fantastic :)
"-Great location, pool, staff, food, masseuses, and landscaping 
-Dim lighting and no warm water were the only drawbacks. Totally worth it though for the price. I would go back there. 
-The friendly and helpful staff were delightful and the proximity to the beach made this place irresistible"
"Very interesting bungalow with bath in nature. It was a great experience. There is also a beach, 5 minutes from hotel.  The food from restaurant wasn't so delicious and more expensive than local restaurants. The Balangan area is a poorest area and it didn't looks so nice. Beach has rocks inside but you also can find without rocks. You can make surf. Big waves"
Close to balangan beach. Very nice cozy small bungalows. Nice pool and food was ok.  Our family liked so much. There is not so much trafik so it's easy to move by scooter.
Great time.  The location is walking distance to the beach and a number of local warnings and restaurants.   They have two scooters for rent if you want to get out and explore.  Pool was refreshing and clean   Great to relax around and cook off before bed.   Breakfast was included - traditional food so not lots of protein  but tasty and fresh.
"I booked for two nights and ended up adding a third, I wish I would have added more! The staff was friendly and accommodating and little restaurant and pool area was great to eat or just hang out in the evening and read. BUT if you aren't someone who has been camping and enjoyed it, this might not be for you. The bungalows are open and bathrooms even more open. I'm very outdoorsy and even my confidence was tested when on the first night and unknown small mammal cascaded down my roof and into the bathroom and spent some time. By the time I found my courage and cell phone flashlight, it was gone. If that sounds like a fun adventure you'll enjoy your stay immensely. My only real qualms are that it wasn't near much without (well overpriced) taxi or scooter and the fans did not do that well in cooling the place down at night."
"If youre looking for a calm, quiet, tropical place with always positive staff, this is the place to be."
"Pros: Interesting concept, you feel very close to nature. Sleep in wooden chalets, open ceeling bathroom. Beautifull green plants around. Nice and helpfull staff at reception.
Cons: Cleaning staff need to be checked by boss or changed.  Light is very insuficient in chalet and bathroom. Breakfast very basic.  For some customers missing TV and AC could be problem, for nature lovers it is a  big plus.
Beach near to Flower bud is not possible to use at december, rent a motorbike directly atFlower bud and drive to Nusa Dua beach which is only one beach usable."
Sweet little bungalows with a nice outdoorshower. Nice pool to relax and very friendly staff. 5 minutes walk to Balangan Beach.
"Lovely bungalows with fans (no aircon), they arranged a baby cot for us.
Beautiful pool in lush garden.
Food is a bit average and expensive in my opinion (we only ordered ""european dishes""though).
Staff is really kind and super helpful, thanks :)"
Amazing stay we loved everything about the bungalows except we came at the hottest time and there is only a fan in the room so hard to sleep at night.
The downside is no airconditioning.
Good place to relax
good
Stayed there a week and enjoyed every minite of it.
