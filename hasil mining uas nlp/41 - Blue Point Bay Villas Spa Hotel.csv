Column 1
"A sparkly clean room and a bathroom with an outdoor view.
Complimentary toiletries that are amazing quality.
Located on the cliffs of Uluwatu with magical views.
And a beach club on the property with a vibe love no other. 
Other bars and restaurants are located along the same cliff.
The famous Kecak dance is a short walk away and a must see when in Bali.
Average breakfast at the hotel."
"The location of this hotel is superb. The views from the dining room, terrace and infinity pool are exceptional. Having breakfast while watching the  surfers negotiate the waves...and on occasions dolphins, is tremendous.
The standard rooms do not have ocean views, they have garden views - where you can watch the monkeys attempt to steal anything that the guests have left unprotected, which is amusing.
The  rooms themselves are large, clean and comfortable. They have a/c, fridge, satellite tv. and a balcony or terrace. They might not be as modern as some people would like but they are perfectly comfortable/functional, and when you consider the price paid for such an amazing locational it is exceptional.
The only thing is the infinity pool, which is still open and accessible contrary to what others have said., needs maintenance, the bottom/floor needs to be painted or retiled  as it has obviously deteriorated when the hotel was closed due to Covid, despite this it is still functional.
There are also numerous restaurants within walking distance of the hotel so you are not restricted."
"Nice suite rooms my daughter loves the bathrooms. Love the views. The bedding and towels seem to be washed in perfume which was a bit full on trying to sleep.  Great staff thoughtful and caring as I was sick for a few days appreciate all the ginger teas with honey they made especially for me. taxi drivers outside were helpful going to surf spots looking after your stuff, picking you up"
We absolutely loved staying at Blue Point! The highlight is definitely their awesome breakfast with ocean views. Highly recommend and can’t wait to be back!
"Nice place. Bestest location in Uluwatu, can see Uluwatu beach from hotel. I got a free massage coupon."
"The room is spacious and clean but there were some insects found every morning in the toilet or by the window. The villa is nice but located a bit far from the main buildings(restaurant and swimming pool) feels like isolated but on the other hand it keeps you safe from the noise from the bar. The best of this place is the nice view of the restaurant. Breakfast was awesome with the view. And the hotel swimming poll is linked to the famous Single Fin, where you can enjoy nice music and sunset from the cliff. Also the food was good. 
But you cannot call grab to the hotel because of local transport company gangs(?) and they charge you 2-3 times more expensive. Eg) Hotel to Kuta beach by grab (160,000 IDR) vs. local transport (300,000 IDR)"
"We booked it thinking that it was near beachside but were wrong. The hotel was mostly on cliff side. Need to get down on steep steps to get to tiny beach. But you can stop along the way on bars and cafes to enjoy the stunning view. 
The breakfast was exceptional and the staff very helpful and friendly. The pool was also beautiful. Overall we enjoyed our stay immensely."
"Could not fault our stay. Location , views, food good.I only had one complaint which was about the availability of tax services. Taxi’s arranged from outside by the guests were not allowed in the hotel compound and local taxi’s outside the hotel gate were quoting ridiculous prices for short journeys."
"Looking for peace, surf ,social or local culture, stay here"
"Infinity pool has a beautiful sunset view. Every month I stay here to attend the full moon event at Istana (5 mins away). Beautiful ocean view at the poolside. Breakfast is included in a gorgeous dining area with glass walls and breathtaking ocean view. I like to watch the surfers while I sip on my tea in the mornings at breakfast. Rooms are clean, hotel is a bit old and run down (which explains the low prices) but the view NEVER gets old. Love this place and the staff are super friendly."
Gorgeous views. Friendly staff. Place is definitely for large events. We do suggest though the garden areas should be maintained a little better. Everything else was perfect.
"Worth every cent! It’s just a walk to single fin, breakfast is AMAZING, staff very friendly and the room was so clean and tidy.
Would totally recommend (while I was there, I recommended to 2 Other friends who are coming to bali)
Amazing experience!"
"I wanted to stay in this hotel since 2019, but o Lu now I had the opportunity to book it. The location is super good, with a pool and sunset view and access to Single Fin party :) 
The rooms was a bit old and not as good as I expected. Monkeys wouldn’t let me enjoy my little balcony, so it’s kinda just the room. 
And I only had hot water half of my stay, since the staff turned off the shower hotter without telling me. But after a few weeks I figured it out and had warm showers again :)"
"Nice place to stay, it has a beautiful sunset view, near by the beach, great restaurants, scooter rentals, nice rooms, monkeys around if you havent seen them elsewhere"
"It was a pleasant stay, the view is spectacular….."
"I was very concerned after booking the hotel and reading the negative reviews online. 
Upon reaching the hotel, I surprisingly figured out that the condition is fairly good. The room is spacious and the wifi is very stable. The swimming pool is good and the breakfast food in buffet style is delicious. 
Most of all, the ocean view is breathlessly amazing. Either swimming in the infinite pool or sitting in front of the window of the restaurant, you will feel something different and worthy."
"We stayed 1 night it’s such a beautiful place tho like most hotels in Bali it’s a little run down. They need to do a lot grounds work to get it back to its former glory. 
Our room was beautiful 
And single fin bar is just amazing again due to Covid they r charging top dollar and work needs to be done there as well"
Best views from a hotel ever!!! Lovely efficient staff . Excellent breakfast.  Not the place to stay for a quiet break. Plenty of partying due to sharing pool with Singlefin. However very vibey if thats what you're looking for.
"Hotel staff was very helpful, hotel location is awesome , lively place"
Breathtaking views
good view and sunset
"Garden suite we very big and nice, only issue was the doors weren't fully secured and let bugs in. Restaurant was very good, expensive, beautiful view. Pool wasn't always clean looking but ocean view"
"I didn't face any kind of problem during my stay in the hotel.
their pool is one of the best in the Uluwatu."
"Very nice place, Awesome dining area / breakfast on top of the cliff with a great view of the sea, wasn't too crowded when we were there and thats what we loved. Easy to get to. Excellent service from the only person at the reception (past midnight). You can walk down to a secluded beach from here with interesting overhanging rock faces, the beach is not crowded, almost nobody here, at low tide the beach extends out really far. Absolutely beautiful. Stones throw away from other scenic attractions.
We booked this place last minute for a midnight check-in after  we got ""booted"" by another hotel, and with that bad experience Agoda gave us a full refund (thanks Agoda!). This hotel even accepted late payment due to the delay in the system recognizing our booking from Agoda and gave us keys to the room recognizing that we were tired. We paid by credit card the next day once the booking was recognized. 
Awesome hotel, service, awesome agoda, awesome everything."
"The pool view is stunning, location is perfect and the staff were very helpful.  They even made my husbands birthday special which we really appreciated.  Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
"Lovely 4 star hotel that has most things you need very close by, now connected to Single Fin, has great pool vibes drinks and food! I had an ocean view room which was beautiful my friend had garden suite, very lovely! Just need a bit more garden maintenance and other maintenance around the place 🤔 very helpful staff at Bluepoint Villas and Spa."
Amazing location and lovely staff. Our room was very spacious with nice views. Great place to stay for surf and the breakfast room has an awesome view of the waves
Near to Pandawa Beach. And single fin restaurant
"We stayed at Blue Point Bay for four days and enjoyed our stay. Only one pool was open and the bottom needs a good cleaning, but the water was well maintained and there were plenty of deck chairs. The hotel is older and could use some upgrades, but the room was nice and the grounds were spacious. We rented a motorbike from an outside company, so it was easy to get around, but might be more difficult if you don't have your own transportation as Grabs are not allowed down the road and I have read that taxi rates are high, but there are plenty of taxi drivers right outside."
"Fabulous views, lovely staff, needs a bit of maintenance doing like gardens but overall great 4 star hotel. If beach vibes are what you are after then this is your place. I booked early and got great prices! Many thanks for our wonderful stay out of some hustle and bustle 🏝️🌊😎"
"This by far was my best experience overall Bali, this place is perfect!"
"Good value for money for the location, the pool & included breakfast. Staff very friendly"
"The breakfast is super nice, buffet style. The pools are really nice and you can swim untill 23pm. Also at night they put music untill late, perfect for a mojito. The rooms are separated from the pool so you don't hear the music.
The room itself is not super nice but is clean and the bed comfortable.
100% recommended if you want a nice pool and a beautiful sunset on the restaurant."
"Sadly 2 years of pandemic combined with bad management have left this beautiful hotel in some desperate need of TLC, the groundings are not as beautiful as it used to be, many facilities are out of service and the pool bottom is slimy. The bedrooms are still nice inside. And I LOVED every single second of my stay.  If you love surfing Uluwatu this is a great place to stay. Prime location and yummy brekky at Single Fin with beautiful views. If you love watching the sunrise, sunset and surfing this is a great place to stay at.  Also there is a party every Sunday evening at Single Fin (which is connected to the Hotel pool)."
More Disc Price and More cheaper room...^^
Unbeatable location. Good breakfast and well priced food and drinks. Bathrooms need to be refurbished.  Don't like the fact that the pool is shared by Single Fin restaurant. Seems as if day visitors are given precedence over hotel guests when it comes to pool facilities. Hotel guests cannot use daybeds without spending a minimum of 1 million Rupiah. This results in pool being overrun on some days by raucous groups of day visitors. Not the kind of place to book in if you're looking for a quiet peaceful environment.
Great Hotel and near all the hot spots. Highly recommend!
The hotel and staff were great. We enjoyed our stay! The only downside is that most things/restaurants are out of walking distance. If you're comfortable riding a scooter then it'll be no problem.
"First time at this hotel
Great spot, older style hotel.
Rooms were spotless, staff were great!"
"Location was good as near uluwatu cliffs and magestic many steps.
Infinity Pool was lovely and if required staff to accomodate.
Room had a balcony with a little view. Basic facilities in room."
"Room 502;
Big comfortable bed clean linen and big and clean room. 
Nice with tea kettle and chiller in the room with restock water, tea, coffee, soap etc. 
Tv small and no sharp picture.
Pool appear to have dirty tiles on the bottom.
Price level on beverages, treatments, pool day beds are expensive."
"Second time staying here, honestly came back for the location next to Single Fin and the amazing pool over the ocean. Like a lot of things after Covid, the place is a little more run down than I remember which is sad to see. Staff are AMAZING and can’t beat the location"
"AC kept the room cool, BEAUTIFUL views from the pool!"
"I was amazing stay in blue point. But last day when we were checking out from hotel , we asked to staff to provide breakfast early, as we had flight and we need to leave But staff lady behaved very bad with us and she was very rude"
"Great staff, great views, lovey monkeys on your balcony to keep you company!  Rooms a bit dated but more than compensated by friendly staff, awesome breakfast and two swimming pools."
"It is not up to it's former glory and not really resort class anymore but clean tidy rooms albeit a little dated.
Great outlook to the ocean, the food is ok and pandemic pricing is cheap and reflects the current situation. I was on a project for a couple of days so just needed a place to rest my head. Spent more on food and beverages than the room cost but overall it suited my project needs."
Decent; but at the same time improvements are being made. Great views of the ocean and breakfast (think continental) is worth it in comparison to what one can get around. Facility can use some upgrades and bathrooms are from a 1998 movie.
"I booked this place mainly for the pool BUT on Wednesdays and Sundays they let the single fin party people into the hotel pool. I could not get a towel because they were sold out. You cannot get a sun lounge and the pool is packed either people sitting and drinking (and highly likely going to the toilet in the pool).. the bottom of the pool looks terrible...either gunk or tiles need replacing. I still couldn't get a towel the following morning. Other than that: fantastic! Beds are super comfy, shower pressure is great, location is spot on, staff amazing and buffet delicious. I will definantly stay there again but will be prepared next time re the pool. Swimming and Padang Padang is much better anyway!"
"Couldn't even see the amazing view since there was quite a bit of construction. Otherwise, would 10/10 recommend it, but should call to make sure it's quiet and you can see the water."
Great place to stay- views simply amazing.
Pool required maintenance and foyer area to apartments required a large amount of work to bring building back to an appealing look very run down. Probably due to Covid
Generally facilities were looking a bit tired and needed some maintenance. Hard to get a better location for surf checks and hanging poolside though.
"The hotel is pretty well located, right down the infinity pool and restaurant you can walk to one of the most incredible places at Bali: Pantai Suluban - the hotel is great but a little abandoned at the details. Breakfast wasn’t that good because we are vegan and there’s no much options, only two kind os fruits… But if you are young and like parties you gonna enjoy a lot the place, there’s happy hours at the pool
With a loud sound system and a lot of people having fun. We had a great 15 min free massage when we arrived!"
Great location and friendly helpful staff. Buildings are in need of repair but clean and comfortable.  Poolside gets very busy as you share with single fin beach club and not enough umbrellas. Top pool was closed. Food was great and good value. Breakfast was really good.
"Most rooms are run down, get sea view room as they are new. Advertises 3 pools and only 1 . Staff are fantastic, but hotel needs a lot of love. Location fantastic"
"Over all we enjoyed out stay at Blue point. The breakfast was fabulous everytime and it was fun to have the pool area over looking the ocean. We could walk to some beautiful beaches, restaurants and cafes. We had a big king bed that was comfy and we got to see some monkeys come up on our deck which was cool. The biggest downfall was our bathroom really needed updating and didn't feel clean. Our deck door needed to be sealed better as outside bugs were making there way inside the room and bathroom. For the price you pay though it's hard to complain. It might be worth paying extra for the better room."
"Great pool!! Staff are very nice. A good location to watch the sunset, surfers and swim but it is along way down many stairs to the beach. The room is comfortable but needs upgrade."
Best location to surf Uluwatu
"Bad: the hotel needs maintenance (pool, rooms...) and the staff is not so friendly than other places we visited.
Good: amazing location (great view) and good breakfast"
Good but needs proper maintenance.
"Good place, good location, staff excellent."
The hotel is good only that it’s quite far from the other hot spot area . Need for transport to move around
Resort is wonderful but the room was just Okay. It has a very beautiful pool which makes the stay worthwhile. Staff is courteous.
"We stayed for the view and location, we were not sure what the rooms would be like. But you can see the affects of covid 19. The rooms and hotel were rundown and it seemed like the hotel was abandoned during the covid pandemic and then they have started to fix everything up when the tourists returned. Aircon was dirty. BUT! the location and the view is amazing, the best sunsets at the pool! And there a heaps of great places for food up the road if you have a scooter or can get a go jek."
"Having the hotel on top of the cliff restos and surfing area
Wins it.. the cleanliness is bad and  the room is
Old,our room’s door is almost not functional a lot of insects flying in the room ,
But the view and vibe from the resto is good.."
"Great view from the pool area! if you are looking for having drinks in the pool listening to super loud music, with fantastic view of the ocean, this is your place. The rooms are in the back away from there so not really disturbing your sleep. but the music is so loud that you cannot hear the waves, nor talk to each other.  Staff is great. Maffia like taxi organisation outside the hotel. The rooms are somewhat shabby, bed is clean and comfortable, smell is good. Food is good. It's not a place I will return to, but then I am a traveller more into calm places."
"We got what we thought was an awesome deal $40/night at Blue Point, however the room was part of their older block and very tired. Bath was stained and didn’t drain well, hot water was intermittent during a shower, and the room was a dingy and dark. The staff were lovely and very helpful though if we brought something up - we had the wrong air con remote first night but they found us the right one straight away, they unclogged the bath drain, and they fixed the door when it fell off it’s slider. 
We had a look at the new rooms and they look really nice (but more than double the price!).
The buffet breakfast was often cold, but otherwise a good selection. The way to order eggs could be better - lining up felt like you’re at school camp, and more than once someone else would take our order so we’d have to order and wait again. 
Exceptional view of the surf break from the hotel restaurant though, which made up for it in some way. 
The pool looks out over the ocean is amazingly located, nice and big and perfect temperature, but signs of wear are present everywhere - the pool is no longer blue at the bottom and in need of a repaint, the bathrooms have water damage in the ceiling and the showers are barely a dribble. They only have about 6 umbrellas so we would always be rushing out after breakfast to secure one (we are travelling with our 6month old). 
The pool was a lovely place to hang out until about midday, when Single Fin, the bar adjacent to the pool and also runs the pool bar, would start cranking the tunes more and more until the amp was shaking. We stayed two weeks and this was a constant frustration as the pool was where the hotel guests wanted to relax and chill, not hear blasting techno in morning/lunchtime. We asked the staff to turn it down on two occasions, and another guest had asked another day so it wasn’t just us. By the end of our stay we found they weren’t turning it up so loud which was a relief and made visiting the pool a lot more enjoyable. 
The"
"Fortunately we only stayed here for 1 night. On arrival we were amazed with the views and the staff, given a 20% off food and drinks voucher. I believe one of the pools is shared with the beach club ‘super fin’ - staff there were not attentive, and wouldn’t let us use our voucher was told to go to the restaurant and order. They apologised and in fact they have an agreement to use the voucher at super fins.
Grounds to the hotel were beautiful and the staff were so helpful. Until we saw our room. It was disgusting. Dirty. Marks on the walls everywhere, dirty marks on the curtains, odd marks on the bed (didn’t even have to search for them were clear as day).
Sliding doors on the balcony didn’t fully shut, so was a massive gap allowing any critter in - mosquitos too (which doesn’t help as I’m highly allergic).
Would visit again but WOULD NOT STAY!!!"
"Place has been let go over covid. Pool is not a nice colour anymore, they no longer do a buffet breakfast and your breakfast comes from single fin downstairs and is good food just not a big selection. Rooms are average. Our hot water was not good took a long time to heat up. Toilet dtruggled to flush."
It's  too old comparé  to the photo
"The room was fine for the price, but there was no restaurant or room service available. Did the job as I was going to an event nearby. Good location."
"View is amazing, but hotel is very run down (expected after Covid) but restaurant wasn’t open or spa and this wasn’t advised on the advertisement, which was disappointing. Also pool wasn’t clean (you couldn’t see the bottom) and it was hard to even get a spot by the pool as people from single Finn took up the beds, so couldn’t even lay by the pool as a paying guest. Overall disappointing, ended up checking out two days earlier."
"good budget accom if you just need a place to stay after heading to Single Fin, not a great experience here my friend slipped in the tub and hit her head on the side she was quite badly hurt, they should have a warning sign or a grip bath mat in the bath it could have ended a lot worse! there were cockroaches also in the room prob wouldnt stay here again"
"Rooms spacious and okay. 
Bathtub superior rm.
book together in with Nice Single fin breakfast.
awesome view."
"Very basic, the hotel has been let go over covid compared to the photos, could be cleaner, room was basic, roof leaked water on our second morning, single fin bar really good food and friendly staff, pool needs some maintenance but for cheap price with amazing views & location, you get what you pay for!"
"Had a nice stay , pool area is great and the views are beautiful over looking the ocean, 
Breakfast was ok,  restaurant over looking the ocean is also very nice , magical views, they need more umbrellas by the pool, also try to charge you $100 for the big day beds, kind of annoying , staff were friendly but they should be chasing you up a bit better for drinks and food. 
Room are decent, clean, it’s the kind of hotel where you just laze by the pool all day, not really a lot to do in uluwatu. Nice quiet location."
Best location
Room had a musty smell
Got the best ocean view in Bali but shorthanded of staff
The place overall is well past it’s best but location makes up for it. Basic breakfast
"When you book make sure you pick deluxe room as the superior is extremely bad! We booked first superior (which was not that cheap also! ) and when we saw the room we were terrified, bathroom looked like in Hitchcock movie, we asked for different room but it was same, at the end they offered us upgrade to Deluxe for additional price. These rooms are in different building are are new and clean.
The pool is perfect with beautiful view and direct access to Single Fin bar.
Breakfast is fantastic."
The location of this hotel is perfect right overlooking the perfect Uluwatu. The infinity pool is great and the breakfast is amazing. Will defiantly come back
"The hotel is located right beside uluwatu beach. Great location for surfer! There is room of improvement for the room cleanliness and staff knowledge.
The hotel is located near pangjalan ojek. Hence gojek driver is not allowed to enter."
I stayed in room 706 and changed to room 712 when I found that the  room air con was not working. Eventually the room 712 air con was also not working. The hotel started operation since 2003 only. The aircon can still be well maintained. Please stay away from this hotel if you are looking for rooms with aircon. As for the 2 rooms didn’t mop and top up the toiletries.
"They have let this place go so badly that I don't think they can bring it back.  There are some buildings and rooms in this complex that have completely shut down due to decay.   Our room was just musty and damp.  The redeeming part of our stay was the wonderful staff  who are always smiling and working hard against all odds,"
"The Blue Point Spa and Villa should have been an amazing experience. The potential is incredible, the location is stunning and the staff are very helpful and friendly. 
However, the rooms themselves are grim. COVID has clearly had a massive impact the property. Our first room was filthy, full of mould and dust, with stains on the bedding and walls. We were upgraded to a deluxe suite, which appeared lovely. But during the night, myself and my partner had some unexpected guests. We were woken by rats running throughout the room. One of which was on the bedside table next to my partners head. We checked out the next morning."
"We spent 3 nights at Blue Point Resort and most probably would not return.
This is my honest opinion.
Positives - location, infinity pool looking over the ocean, ok food in the restaurant,  great day/ night club , music 
Negatives - the rooms were very dated , could use a fresh coat of paint, our bathroom basin was leaking water all over the floor, staff not as friendly as other places in Uluwatu which really let the resort down and the cleaner stole some money from out of a purse in our room. Also a real downer,
Leaving this review not to criticise but to provide feedback so that the owners can make some improvements."
"Great location right at uluwatu beach. Breakfast was pretty good with an amazing view. We stayed in the beach view villa and it was nice, definitely could be a lot cleaner, everything at this hotel has been lacking some serious maintenance. Main hotel looks so abandoned and rough. Our room had a bad mold smell, and the one next to us was covered in black mold.  Covid hit this place hard, hopefully they can recover and fix this place up. Nothing like the photos though- they were pre Covid"
To be honest. I didn't see any value for money. The resort is trying to mint money for each and every service. No doubt location is great but we didn't enjoy stay as we were provided stay in an isolated cornor room (with no view at all) on third floor plus they charge for nearby bed to the pool. I would have preferred to stay in other Hotels nearby at reasonable cost.
The room was nice but the hotel and grounds are run down. The resort was probably nice at one time. Grabs are not allowed pick up there so you are at the mercy of the local taxi men which i never trust.
"Great location the view is amazing. Accommodation needs a facelift. Rooms have a mouldy smell, lawns need mowing pool needs work."
Great location but the hotel is not as used to be. Dirty and looks like nobody is taking care of the place anymore. Expensive for what it is.
"Old rooms and facilities, definitely need renovation"
Unfortunately it would seem that the accommodation has suffered at the hand of Covid-19. Staff were friendly but the grounds and room were a bit stale. Great location though.
"Great location with amazing views unfortunately the room was dirty, the shower wasn’t work, poor facilities."
Very run down and not looked after. Not how it used to be they also allow anyone in to use the pool now which is annoying when you spend a decent amount if money to stay there. Was not impressed this time.
"Staff are great, location is great - but I wouldn't recommend staying there.
The accommodation facilities are 50 years old and past their used by date sadly.
Not dirty  just oddly depressing to be in.
The jewel in the crown is the clifftop pool are that is amazing. It just wasn't enough keep me there though. I checked out and found better accommodation"
"+ location
+ room size
- drinks prices 
- general maintenance 
- massage (very poor and hugely expensive for Bali)"
Nice hotel to stay with infinity pool
"Decent value for money, but the property is tired and has seen better days."
"Run down, leaking roof, leaking tap, poor water pressure; no hot water, would not stay here again"
Here they add anything from up to $10 a drink ... Bali is surposed to be cheep .... not here it’s not
"They aren’t interested in the accommodation, it’s all about single fin bar and selling alcohol.
Staff are lovely, it’s bali, but under staffed and little to no care taken for guests."
"The location and foundation is an amazing resort, but the current condition of the building and landscape is a nightmare. If you ignore the mold and dust and bugs, it’s fine. Many surfers enjoyed it. But for our honeymoon, we were shown 5 different rooms, all full of mold and cobwebs. We felt disgusting and didn’t want to touch anything. I saw the other bad reviews and we should have stayed away. The staff is nice and hard working but under a lot of stress because they’re clearly not doing well. Hope this helps someone."
"The place hasn't been looked after and it's very run down, there are cracks on the walls and tiles, it's also poorly managed as we found many dirty areas. The breakfast was supposed to be included but when we went to the restaurant and explained we were staying at the resort it wasn't offered. The beach below the resort although is hard to access is pretty and the location is quite isolated. Not many taxis can access the area as it's controlled by the local ones so getting a Grab is impossible. Also the spa is not working and the pool is dirty. Definitely not a 4 star place and not a good price either 😔
I still enjoyed my stay but I'm disappointed by the lack of honesty."
We stayed in junior suite and it was dirty and shabby. The pool was dirty with the bottom covered in brown slime.
You get what you pay for. Cheap rooms and good location but the hotel needs lots of work and a deep clean
"run down, in need of renovation and just general maintenance. Such a pity because the location/view are spectaular"
"Once this hotel was clean and nice. The place looks like a inferno. All destroyed. Rooms are dirty. Spider nets, dirt and smell of moist. Last night a mouse jumped on my while sleeping and woke me up. We have changed rooms 3 times because of bad smell and dirt. 
Hot water may or may not arrive. I just took a cold shower. 
Would not recommend this hotel."
"Too much caterpillar in the property.
service staff was rude.
Rooms and curtains are not cleaned."
"Good sea view from restaurant, but room is not clean and too old facilities"
I would not recommend to stay at this hotel. This is the worst place I have ever stayed in Bali. Hotel and rooms like in prison. Everything is old and dirty. Most uncomfortable bed - hard like rock. No hot water. Boys at the reception just said sorry. Hopefully one day they will do renovation and this hotel will shine.
"We were so dissapointed in this hotel and had a number of awful experiences. The day we arrived we found the infinity pool was under maintanance yet had not been informed and it was closed the entire 5 days we were there. After sharing our dissapointment the Front office manager gave us a gift certificate for dinner (also horrible experience).The room was SO dirty, there was sand and hair all over the floor, dust on every surface, sand and hair in the bed, the bathroom stank. We then called FO who  moved us barely apologised and the main reason they moved us was due to the mold throught the room and we refused to stay in that room. The room we were moved to wasnt much better but cleaner however mold all over the shower curtain and in bathroom. The buffet breakfast was horrible. The restaurant staff were rude arrogant and not friendly AT all.  After 3 weeks in bali staying in fabulous hotels this was SO Dissapointing!!!"
"The hotel is abandoned, rooms are full of mold, and the toilet smells really bad. Don't go."
"The hotel is completely dishevelled and looks nothing like the photos on Agoda or the hotel’s website. I feel scammed.
Room had black mold, bugs everywhere, dirty floors and bed linens, there was blood in the bathtub, and all of the doors were falling off their hinges and would get stuck.
My sisters and I were so concerned about hygiene and potential bed bugs that we did not unpack and asked the front desk for a refund. They said there was nothing they could do, so we paid for accommodations elsewhere and left.
I understand that this misrepresentation falls on the hotel, but Agoda should not be marketing this as a 4-star hotel. All of the hostels we stayed in Bali were 10 times nicer than this “resort”."
"We stayed at Blue Point resorts and spa in Uluwatu Bali. When we showed up to check in they were very confused and it seamed like they were not open. They gave us a room however no one else was staying in the resort. Literally no one! For such a big resort it was completely empty. The grounds to the room were unkept and not like the photos. There were bats inside of the hotel and so many weird noises when we were trying to sleep! 
We ended up leaving at 12:00 am midnight as we didn’t feel safe staying here. When trying to leave there was nobody on the resort grounds or in the lobby and the security gate was closed. Never in our time with booking a resort we felt this unsafe we where we had to leave.
The pool is the only good thing about this resort at the current time. 
Please consider booking another place until this place fully reopens and these issues are addressed."
The room was unclean and rundown! The room was so stinky and the toilet was broken. With excellent views of brick walls and a barbed wire fence! ( We booked with garden view then turn out this terrible room and view) The pool area has great views but you can’t bring your own water ! you must buy there OVER priced food and drinks! We would not recommend staying here as you don’t have to be a guest to use the pool! Wish I could give a 0 star for the cleanliness. So disappointed.
"In the 10 years I’ve been coming to Blue point I’ve never seen this place so run down! 
It’s at the state where it needs to be demolished. 
My list of things which went wrong staying here are endless! 
Just know the pool only opens at 11am! 
And today I requested towels and were given used towels. The staff were quite embarrassed! The hotel looks like it’s completely booked out and has got a whole lot of vibe.:: is not the case at all! 
I would never come back here again! 
It’s now ran by single fin owners which clearly have no clue. 
The staff are bartenders with no experience in hotel management. They don’t care and they also agree they have zero care in customer service. 
This place needs some series investors! 
I paid for an upgrade which wasn’t available online as we didn’t have any hot water or a shower head to shower. My husband took a shower at the outdoor pool lol.
However we still paid which I don’t mind as this place needs all the money it can get. 
But I wouldn’t recommend it at this stage… the pictures are from years ago way before Covid! 
The whole place looks like a rubbish dump! 
Love to share pics! 
I’m surprise Agoda even advertises this place. 
Rant done ."

It was a total waste of money. We have checked out afte
