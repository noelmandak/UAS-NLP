"Overall experiences with Bene was satisfied. Excellent location, walking distance to the mall, beach and famous cafe. 
Service was top notch and the massage was a boom. The massage was an highlight of the stay. Highly recommended.
Room was clean and water pressure is good. A small touch, hotel prepare one soft and one hard pillows! 
A small issue is on the water, the water from the tap is a little salty, however this is not a big concerns as they prepared bottle water on the counter."
"This was my second time staying at The Bene, once pre-covid and now after covid. I’d always recommend this hotel, great location, awesome staff, easy to find blue bird taxi’s & restaurants nearby and good amenities (buffet breakfast, fridge in the room, aircon) at a very reasonable price. During our stay my partner got a bad ear infection in both ears and they ordered a doctor to our room that spoke great english and wasn’t too expensive. 
You could see where covid may have affected the hotel compared to beforehand but even while we were there they made big improvements to the state of the hotel and will continue to do so. Would definitely recommend."
"very comfortable, excellent swimming pool, good food, close to the beach"
the location is near shops and malls. it is also walking distance to the beach! the facilities are nice and well maintained. Kudos also to the staff that are very polite and accommodating.
"Suitable for family
Hotel cleanliness was so good"
"Not over priced, located in a quite street
Clean comfortable breakfast is good and staff are very friendly"
"A little more modern than your traditional hotels in the Kuta area, its tucked away off a side street, and close to the beach (2min walk). The hotel staff were awesome and very accommodating. We had to change rooms on the top floor due to a very noisy water pump (warning), and then again when the aircon in one of the new rooms started to drip a lot of water onto the floor. Other than that, the rooms were a good size, clean and modern, and all with balconies overlooking the pool. The pool was closed for a couple of days when we were there and there was some day construction noise at the one end of the hotel that made relaxing by the pool impossible. The breakfast was shockingly bad. For a 4star, where everything else was at a good standard, the breakfast was well below par. We just avoided it altogether the next couple of days and enjoyed the restaurants in the neighborhood. Try the Beach Bowl by the entrance of the hotel, it’s one of our fav spots in Kuta. Also, the entrance for the hotel does not show up on Go/Gojek maps, so asking a ride to pick you up there isn’t easy."
"Cons: 
Not so strong wifi (but not an issue at all, mobile data in Bali is very cheap)
Pros:
Many restaurants and souvenir shops nearby
5min walk to Kuta beach
Very near to convinience stores
In-house spa and resto
Highligts:
Buffet breakfast
Spacious and very clean room (i got 302)
Staff are all accomodating and cheerful
*Will definitely refer to my friends :)"
"Room very clean, food is good, employee very friendly"
From arrival to departure the staff could not be more accommodating. Great location and comes with a great price. Second time staying here and  this time with the pool access room. I would highly recommend.
"We never expected the Bene to be an accomodating and luxurious hotel because we booked it in a cheap price but we were surprised with the aesthetics of the place and their amazing customer service. The amenities are great, the food is delicious especially the Bebek Goreng and the ambience is very relaxing. The Bene is a highly recommended hotel for people who want to visit Bali and stay near Kuta Beach in a very affordable price."
Staffs were really friendly and full of smiles.
"Location is really good and staffs had never lost smile on their face. I was 6th visit at The Bene Hotel. But if I have to pick one thing that I want it to be better is that unlikely past few years, the property has been bit soggy and wet for the bed. Some rooms don't, but some others has very wet atmospere in the room. beside this, everything is good"
"Pros the staff
The breakfast was nice 
The pool was very refreshing
The pool access rooms are great. 
Cons... Ppl who sit on the pool lounges outside your room and smoke! Non smoking rooms fill with dirty stinking cigarette smoke. Should be a no smoking zone around the pool."
"Good price and location.
I've honestly come to this hotel more than 5 times. Every time when I come to Bali, my journey starts and ends at here.
Staffs are very kind"
"Have stayed here a few times now, will always be at the top of my Kuta stay list. Peaceful but not boring, plenty of pool chairs, rooms are immaculate. Well worth the money. Great location and great staff"
"Check in was fast. Reception was very friendly and helpful. We booked 3 pool access room and requested for connecting room.  
The room was nice. Bed and pillow was comfortable. We make a right choice for booking the pool access room. The pool was less than 5 steps from our room."
Over all good 👍🏻
"Everything was very good. I would return if my schedule allows. Breakfast was great with lots of options, and an egg station. Air conditioning was crisp! Staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint would be that the buttons for the elevator were very temperamental, not the elevator itself.  You had to push a lot in multiple strengths (light tap, long press, and so on) in order to get the elevator to open. It's more of a personal annoyance than a reason to avoid the Bene."
"What a gem of a little place a short walk from the bustle of kuta beach and a short walk from JL legian. 
Quiet and amazing"
I really love this place . its a bit far from clubs and bars so its quiet calming . the staff here is super nice . they trying their best to help us . its close to the beach about 10 minutes walk and your right at kuta beach . Breakfast is a lot variety of food and they got hukkah too .
"a good hotel but in my opinion there needs to be a replacement of some tools such as some rusty aluminum equipment, and for input there needs to be a menu that varies every day.  for cleanliness needs to be improved because of renovation work."
"Great clean and modern hotel and with a fantastic location. 
Currently know international Channel’s  on the TV’s, only local TV channels and no food room service facilities available."
"Property location is good, rooms are also cleaned and spacious. Overall experience is good. However hotel management should improve their policy, so that guests doesn't feel they are staying in a cheap property. Receptionist will ask for security deposit during check-in, receptionist will warn you if you broke or damage anything you have to pay. Even if you ask for an umbrella staffs will warn you about the consequences in case you loose it. If you break a glass they will penalise you 50k IDR. You will be always in fear with their warnings.
If any property gets damage by guest, guests are willing to pay for it in case its their fault. But warning the same things again and again doesn't sound good."
"- really love the breafast. they used premium ingredients. Keep it up
-clean room
- welcoming staffs."
"Staff is excellent - courteous and always helpful. Good sized pool and does not get crowded. Tried room service once and it is okay - nothing special but not too expensive. Breakfast is buffet and change some items in the menu everyday. Needs improvement especially during peak times - they take time to replenish the items. 
Rooms though is where they need to improve on. Rooms are spacious but it needs a major revamp. Rusty safe, hangers and handles. Tiles need polishing. Bed sheet has stains though clean and smells good to be fair. Not sure if its only me but the tap water has a certain taste - I didn't use it for drinking but would use it to gargle and for toothbrush. Had to use the mineral water they provided daily.
I was just expecting more especially in the room since the price is higher compared to the other hotels in the same range."
"Great hotel in Kuta, All staffs are nice and sweet, room is comfortable"
its located just behind the beaches.
"We slept great, minimal noise, nice spot. Close to the beach and shops."
"It’s a very good location. Staff is very friendly and helpful. 
Was a bit noisy during the day because of ongoing construction.
The breakfast was nice, but sometimes we faced empty bowls, and it was taken quite a while until they refreshed. 
X-mas playlist got a bit annoying (with just few songs on repeat, same every day), but it’s a very personal point of view! Btw during the day the music was more diverse ;-)"
"Some maintenance required in most rooms, floor water damage. Royal suite good size ( 2 rooms ). Staff friendly, breakfast ok."
"We have always loved this hotel and will always will. Location is nice, staffs are nice, room is nice, the pool is more beautiful before covid. But the pool is not well maintained, so thats kinda sad. But other than that is ok."
"Super happy trip . Everything was great from staff, food and cleanliness. My 2nd time here for 14 nights. Breakfast was good, fairly good choices but you have many options mins away ..
Location was pretty good off the Main Street in quite location. Highly recommend!!"
"This hotel actually near from Kuta Beach, but I booked this hotel for staycation. For me, this hotel is good for it. The breakfast are delicious and the staff are friendly. The swimming pool is quietly cold but I have so much fun tho! With 200k++ for price at this pandemic I think this is the best offer I can have 👍"
"the pipe water taste salty, makes u feel the water isnt really clean when shower. the rest are ok, nothing to complain. with this price, its quite a good choice."
"Fabulous stay, wish we stayed longer."
"A lot of rooms are still under renovation, our family two bedrooms suite doesn't have any pool view nor window, but quite spacial, breakfast is decent"
Friendly staff and nice buffet breakfast
"This is a nice hotel in the middle of Kuta area. I can walk from the hotel to Beach Walk Shopping mall just minutes away.
The room is clean and nice. The room has small balcony which faces to swimming pool. Very relaxing moment just to sit and spend time on balcony in the afternoon. The hotel has nice swimming pool as well. I had relaxing time staying here. Recommended for those travelling to Kuta"
I like that the 1st floor rooms are connected to the pool area. The staffs are helpful and kind. One thing I wish they improve is adding more breakfast menu option.
"Pleasant stay, clean hotel"
"It would have been 4 stars if the prices were not doubled (because of new management). What is good are the spacious rooms, breakfast, location en and the friendly staff. 
I expect better maintenance for the new pricing (at 4 stars). (Boards at the pool, bathroom (mirror, showerhead) and paint at floorboards near the chair.
Still a good place to stay for a few days"
Great value for your money would definitely stay there again
Upgrading work in progress.
Location is best it is in central of bali.service is good.
"We have stayed at this hotel  four times before with the kids over many years & have loved it,but this time  felt it had gone down hill a bit.
Shower water only just warm
Decking around the pool needs replacing , makes loud noises when you walk on it
Breakfast just ok
Looks like it's'turning into a back packers hotel.
Paul"
"Good and clean hotel, good hospitality 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Value for money, accessible and convenient. Staff are friendly and helpful."
"great place, friendly staff, clean and beautiful"
"Walking distance to shops, restaurants, beach. Quite. I stayed in twin bed superior room maybe a bit small? Was ok I only stayed 1 night close to airport. Friendly helpful staff. Breakfast alright. Great can smoke on balcony of room. Happy stay"
"Location is central and good.
But it’s a bit hard to get a taxi from this  hotel  because of  it’s on the  ally way.
The building is getting old. 
The room is not fancy. 
Breakfast is nothing fancy, 
It would be good for the budget stay in the popular location."
Rooms are OK. Pool is nice but cleanliness in common areas not up to par. Not a bad place to stay as it is close to the beach and relatively close to the airport.
nice stay and near kuta beach
"Shower water is super salty as if you can never feel clean in it. Please don't try this hotel like me. I booked because I didn't trust the reviews but it was indeed true. Otherwise, staff is very friendly and accommodating.
Grab and Gojek werent allowed into this area hence this area is ""cursed"" with hefty amount of cab fare by the locals."
good for family
Nice with your own balcony facing The pool. Nice and roomy room. Liked The woodwork on The balconies
"Its good for those on budget and going for a short getaway. 5mins walk to kuta beach. 15 mins walk to beachwalk mall. Breakfast was ok.
DOWNSIDE WAS My room was hot thou we switch it to full blast. WIFI also not fantastic.Only lvl 1 the wifi is good. I guess it was near the lobby reception. Nevertheless i think its a place for rest at night. Nothing special."
"Comfortable big rooms with separate bathrooms. Only one swimming pool in middle of hotel. Can't find a private spot, majority of hotel rooms are build in ""U"" shape around pool.  Breakfast is just okay. Same food every day. Hotel transport is ridiculously expensive. Better off getting a metered taxi. Staff are all friendly. Hotel is down narrow street just off main beach road,still in Kuta, but right on boarder of Legian. Close to shops, restaurants, spa's and bike rental place. Overall a nice stay in a hotel that is affordable."
Equip the hotel with better first aid facilities.
"Air condition in the room was good. However, the shower area water flow was poor and it was like a taking a shower in a mini swimming pool."
"The Bene is in need of renovation, I have stayed here over a few years now, it can be noisy at the pool which the hotel is centered around, the old Frangipanis around the pool are dead or dying, pool deking is collapsing due to lack of maintenance food is average, the staff service has lowered in my opinion . Its location is good, walking to the beach, shops, money changer. Not central Kuta more the border between Kuta-Legian"
"The hotel is coming to rejuvenation stage, the flooring in the rooms are all water damaged, the rooms require re painting, the pool decking is lifting everywhere tripping hazards, the pool trees are dead & diseased with no other greenery around pool, the awning over restaurant is mouldy needs repainting, the pool itself has mould lines around edges, the are sharp broken tiles in pool floor, the noise from the pool guests can be extremely annoying as there is no rules and large groups take over & children not keep reasonably quiet for all guests.
The toilet cistern had mould around edges, bed was bad unless you ask for topper.
Housekeeping change air conditioner settings higher when make up room.
Breakfast is only ok
This used to be our preferred hotel and have stayed many times over the last couple of years"
Location is very near the kuta beach but you have to walk this alley. It is quite dangerous at night because the hotel is quite deep inside. Housekeeping is the worse ever. 1st day didnt clean the room we have to call the reception to ask to clean. From the way they clean can see that the staff is lazy. Breakfast is another boring thing. I stayed in other hotels that same price as The bene but their breakfast is so much better. Overall i will not book this hotel again
"Fourth stay at The Bene
Pre covid was a nice place
Post covid, looks tired and run down, under new management and needs a heap spent on it.
The timber deck around the pool has broken uneven or missing boards, pool furniture has mould, rooms need upgrades,  water pressure weak and it takes 5 minutes to get warm.
Back end of hotel you can hear a pump running all night.
Kuta Beach not able to swim due to rubbish in water and piled up along sand.
Best look else we're for now 
On the plus side  breakfast was ok  and staff nice.
If you ask for a ice bucket expect to wait 10 minutes.
Outside hotel many shops shut or replaced with tattoo parlours. 
Go to sanur for now till this gs improve"
"No hot runnning water, the electricity is down and the hotel dont have back up (diesel generator), tap water is salty (dont not brush your teeth with tap water), the toilet and bidet water is very dirty (dark), the floor is sticky.  The hotel really needs major improvement!!!"
Breakfast is not good.noisy with swimming pool noise.near by kuta beach is dirty and full of trash and plastic.shower water is salty.
"Pros- Location is near the kuta beach
-Good wifi
Cons - The hotel is located quite deep inside and you have to walk this dark alley. 
- Housekeeping needs to be improved. They didnt clear my food in the dustbin. It was still there after they do the housekeeping. Can see the housekeeper is very lazy
- Breakfast is boring. Nothing much. 
Ive stayed in alot of hotels in bali that is cheaper or same price as The Bene but their service is wayyy better. Harper kuta by Aston is so much better than here"
"Friendly staff and god location is about the o my positive I can say about this hotel
I seriously doubt the authenticity of all the 10 scores given by other travellers. 
The pictures are deceiving and totally not match the reality and breakfast was very limited. To me this is a three star average hotel"
Old and worn out
Hi all should be aware that management changes has caused the hotel to dip in standards ranging from water pressure to safety to consistently unheated water
"The worst hotel I stay, access to busy. Hotel not clean enough. AC not working. Temperature is hot. Not recommend for anyone..."
"My daughter and myself were going to have a mother /daughter week away but my dad suddenly became terminally ill and we needed to be with family ,the manager was not the least bit compassionate and wouldn’t offer any refund or credit tinier in the future other than than to extend for a month .Very disappointing as we come to Bali often would never book here again 
We were actually coming to bring clothing and goods for orphanage there and spend some time to help"
What a terrible hotel.
"We stayed at the Bene Hotel for 4 days. Check-in was smooth and the staff provided us with wet towels and juice during check-in. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and well-mannered. Everybody from the security and front desk staff to the restaurant staff greeted us with big smiles. Our room was on the first floor overlooking the restaurant. Though several reviews had complained about the internet, we faced no such issues and had a good browsing experience. Breakfast was good and there was good variety in the breakfast spread. We informed the staff during check-in that we were vegetarians. The restaurant staff made sure that they prepared separate vegetarian dishes each day. The room was just like how it is in the photos. This is a new hotel and everything looked new and clean in our room. Both hot and cold water were available in the shower. The two best things about this hotel are its close proximity to the beach and its quiet environment despite being so close to the beach. Kuta beach is five minutes away by walk and there are many restaurants, mini marts (convenience stores) and spas on the way to the beach. The alley leading to the hotel was well-lit and the place was safe, so we had no issues walking back to the hotel late at night. As we had an early-morning checkout, the hotel staff booked us a Bluebird taxi to the airport and ensured that our check-out was swift. They also offered and provided us with vegetarian breakfast boxes during check-out. Overall, our Bali experience was made memorable by the staff at The Bene Hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would have no qualms staying here again."
"I had a pleasent stay at the Bene. Starting from the friendly staff behind the counter, the always-smiling guard. The welcome drink was really nice, I felt very welcome at this hotel. I would give a 10 for the staff overall.
Entering the room, I saw how neat and clean the room was. I hope that they will keep this hotel in such a condition, as I understood this hotel was built last year...so keeping the rooms in a good condition would be a challenge for most of Indonesian hotels. The bed was clean, the bathroom was also clean. I would give a 9 for the room. I did not give a 10 as I did not know how their safe works, they could have explain to me how this works. 
However, there are several things that I dislike which are: mosquitos in the room, slow wifi connection, the hotel it self is located in the inner street (I got lost when I tried to find the hotel by walking) and the so-so breakfast (not much choice and the food did not taste that great).
I need to say concerning the location,despite the fact that I couldnt find the hotel easily it is still located in a way that you can easily reach the Kuta beach by walking (5 minutes) and the shopping street which I forget the name already. 
Taken into account the price/quality ratio, I would give this hotel an average of 8,5.
I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel, and the over-friendly hotel was a plus.
Btw, the hotel has also a beautiful swimming pool...but unfortunately I had no time to try out this pool. One disadvantage of the pool is the fact that it is located in the center (each hotel room has a view towards the pool...so the chance exist that guest can watch you swimming)"
"We had an excellent stay at The Bene hotel, it was our last night in Bali so we chose somewhere a bit more expensive than the other hotels and it was definitley worth it. Its a beautiful hotel, centered around the pool, with trees planted around the sides of the pool. We had a pool access double room, which had a massive glass sliding door onto the pool which looked great. The room itself was of a very high standard, newly built and up to date. we had a massive, extremely comfortable double bed, and woke in the morning to a very delicious wide variety buffet breakfast, the best we had had in two weeks. The only downside would have been that the hotel is actually just off the main road by Kuta beach down a very small road, about a 5 min walk from the main road. You wouldnt necessarily know where it was straight away as there is a lack of signs to it. Other than that excellent hotel."
"The bene hotel’s best feature is the amazing staff, who made our stay a memorable one.
Their diligence, integrity and friendliness were above and beyond. The location is very quiet,tucked away in it’s own cul-de-sac, accessed by a private lane way. This keeps the noise from the cars and scooters away, and makes for a nice and quiet sleep. The pool area is good, and the  restaurant overlooks the pool area. Breakfast was excellent and the egg and pancake station was manned by a wonderful cook who really knows what she is doing, making breakfast a really varied pleasure. Choice at breakfast was good, cereals, bacon, eggs, pancakes, bread and pastries and various soup, rice, and noodle dishes and a good assortment of fruits and yoghurts. We stayed in a royal suite, the bed was fantastic, one of the best hotel beds we have ever slept in. The only down side was a slow draining shower in the main room, which would overflow if your shower was more than just a short one. The other shower was fine, so we just used that. Housekeeping was very good, and cleanliness was excellent. The room service menu had good variety, and the quality of the food was good and affordable. Service was quick, even late at night. The air conditioners worked perfectly, and were quite quiet. This hotel offers much at an amazing price point, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wholeheartedly recommend it. I should also mention that security was very good, and the security personnel efficient,yet very friendly to the guests. Thanks again, bene hotel for some wonderful family memories!"
"Before i booked The Bene i read all the reviews on it . What great reviews it had .  It seemed to good to be true as the deal i was looking at was great to. But i took the chance and booked it anyway. I booked for 7 nights. 
Once we arrived we were greeted by the lovely staff and then seeing our room i knew straight away we had found a little gem .
We booked the pool acess room and i couldn't ask for a better room . Highly recommended!
The building is 4 stories high all with balcony  rooms over looking the pool. I personally like having the pool right outside my door. At night is was very quite and you didnt hear the traffic noise. All Staff members are all so friendly and can't do enough for you. Always laughing and smiling. 
My only two very small criticisms would be there is only a very small bar area near the dinning area and if you where looking for some where to sit around at night for a drink with a few friends this is not the place for you. You can tho and we did sit out side our room on our lounge chairs and listen to the music and drank there. To us this was a way better, cheaper and more personal option.  The other very small criticism was the doors slamming a little loud,  but sometimes thats the guests fault not the hotels. 
At 4pm every day there was a DJ that played from 4 till 7. This was just perfect as you could still swim in the pool till 9pm . 
A couple times a week a solo guartist would come and play as well. This is nice and relaxing. The Bene is tucked away down a lane way and can be confronting at night walking back to the hotel, but the security is at the end of the lane watching. I didnt feel unsafe at all.  The pool size was also huge. You could do laps. 
Not many Aussie people staying there, maybe they havnt found it yet."
"It was very satisfying. We saw the photos of Bene Hotel, it's a nice pictures, but we didn't expect much since usually we can't really judge from the photos only. Usually when we see the real room & surrounding, it's most often not as nice as the photos. But when we arrived at Bene Hotel it was surprisingly beyond our expectation. The Room is very clean, the pool is clean & nice, the staff were very friendly & always smiling (even when my son insisted to take the welcome drink to our room :p).
Our room was right beside the pool, it makes us feel more like home. Another thing that's nice is the number of total room in Bene Hotel is not too much. It makes the hotel doesn't feel crowded.
I'll recommend this hotel for family with young children, and couples who wants a serene ambience but not in the jungle.
We will definetely come back there next holiday!"
"I sent the following to the management at The Bene:
""My wife and I stayed at The Bene from 6th to 9th Sept 2013, in room 123.
I have the following comments about our stay there:
The staff was the friendliest ever. We received very good and honest advice on what to do and where to eat. 
I am a vegetarian and I hadn't specified that earlier when I did the booking through Agoda. However, on the first morning, when I came to have breakfast, I realized that everything was non-vegetarian (except for the bread and fruits). I then asked one staff member if they has anything for vegetarians. Within a minute, she got back to me and told me that the chef will prepare something for me. And not only that. After I had finished my breakfast, I was also told that the chef will prepare a special veg breakfast for me for the duration of our stay there and they was asked if the menu was ok. I am very grateful to all your staff for taking this extra effort to ensure I had a good breakfast every morning. (Note: Your chef is amazing! The dishes he comes up with are fit to be served in the finest restaurants!)
I noticed that the hotel was not fully occupied. In most places, this will be the perfect opportunity for the staff to slack and while their time away. However, at The Bene, you staff was always around, to greet and assist in any way possible. And we always ready with a genuine smile. A true display of Balinese hospitality!
I wish to thank your staff for the pleasant time we had at The Bene and would most certainly stay there again when we get a chance to come to Bali again."""
"This hotel is probably the best hotel I’ve stayed so far, their staff is 10/10 friendly , this is my honeymoon stay with my wife and they have a simple but nice decoration for us , we’re so happy to see that. About their staff , very welcoming and always can see smile on their faces with greet good morning and good evening , and thanks for the birthday cake , it’s so heart warming, their breakfast is great, room is spacious and clean, and I can sit on the balcony for a good 2 hours at least coz it’s so relax, and it’s very convenient,walk 5 minutes to mini mart, 10 minutes to Kuta beach, words can’t describe how great this hotel is until you stayed, definitely worth every penny you pay, thank you Bene hotel for the great stay, definitely will stay here again when I’m back to Bali. Much love ."
"I've come to Bali 3 times and stayed in The Bene everytime when Im in Kuta.
1. Price is really competitive. Very cheap with very good morning breakfast.
2. Clean. The room is really clean. Toilet and bed clean everyday.
3. Location waa perfect. Very close to Kuta beach. easily get access for surfing in the beach. restuarant (coconut warung) was also good. Took me 10~15mins to go to the Airport.
4. Staffs are really really kind and down to earth. always smiling and welcoming. they are willing to help a customer everytime with their best.
for the count, I have stayed more than 5 times and each time was more than 4days. Even when this journey will be about to finish, I will go back to The Bene and stay another 2 more days."
"Great location, only a short walk to Kuta Beach. 
The staff here are amazing and will go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible. 
Our room was neat and tidy and was always promptly made up when ever we left the room service light on. 
The room we had included a daily buffet breakfast, which exceeded expectations and started early every morning(6:30am). The omelette chef was a great addition.
We had a problem with the aircon in our room, we notified reception and within minutes there was someone there to fix it!
We had a late flight out, the staff at the Bene looked after our luggage after the 12pm check out (whilst we had one last look around Kuta) and upon our return, they gave us a spare room to shower in and get changed before our flight home.
The only thing I can fault is the bar. It had limited options and was pricey by Kuta standards. We opted for the numerous bars just a stones throw from the hotel.
We will definitely return here!"
"During our stay at The Bene Hotel we were welcomed by their accommodating staff even it was already past midnight. And we where brought to our wonderful room which is very relaxing and the ambiance was just amazing. I would definitely comeback to this hotel when I visit Bali again because the totality is there, good price, good location, peaceful ambiance, accommodating staff, safe environment and everything that you need for a good place to stay at during your visit to Bali, Indonesia."
"My experience at The Bene Hotel, overall it was an excellent stay. It may seem that it's out of the way but once you reach the hotel, it's nicely tucked in a private alley and kinda cozy. About 8 minutes walk to the Kuta beach and another 10 minutes to the Beachwalk mall. You have the small souvenirs stalls all over the place.
The rooms are specious and very clean with safe, lovely kimonos and room slippers 
The receptionists are friendly and speak English well. 
Breakfast had some good spread
Swimming pool, nice and inviting. 
A few yet important facilities needed to be looked into fast.
1) The Wifi, weak at some point and at crucial moments, it disappoints.
2) The BBQ spread was totally disappointing- Don't bother to try this at the hotel on Saturdays unless they have improved the menu.
""Weldone, staffs od The Bene Hotel""
The hotel must"
"The Bene Hotel is great for someone who is looking for a relaxing place to stay but wants to be near the Popular Kuta Beach. 
Each room has pool facing Balcony, for those who wants a direct pool access, such rooms are available too. At night, you can relax in the pool under the blanket of stars, listening to the live singer seranading with soothing songs. Once you step out of the hotel, it brings you to the busy Kuta area with lots of happenings. One thing to note, the hotel is located at one corner of an alley. Then again, if you want the best of both worlds; relaxing chillax place and bustling Kuta Beach at a reasonable place, this is worth considering!"
"The hotel is about 15 to 20 minutes from the airport. It was easy to get a taxi & the name of the hotel was familiar to many taxi drivers. We paid 10 US $ for the ride to the hotel. The moment we entered the hotel the staff were friendly. We were welcomed with towels & drinks.  Our check in was quick. All the staff can understand & do speak English. I loved the bed, the room, the varrender.  But I was a bit dissappointed with the corridors & the toilets. Its a jewel,  a hidden one yet everything is close. The location is excellent.  When we use to come back from our long tours it feels so relaxed being in the Bene. The hotel is quite & very relaxing. I loved the design of the hotel. Its cute & pleasing in my eyes. Every evening they play loud music in the pool. I liked it & my family members loved it too. Will i come back to the Bene yes will definately come back & shall highly recommend to friends & relatives. The management  need to take care of the cleaning that is done in the toilets & corridors.  Otherwise you will ruin this little cute jewel. One more thing the toilet towels have grown old & their colour have changed. To be frank I  never used their towels had my own. I would recommend you bring yours. Other than that well done the bene guys. Keep the customer service higher & higher. Will see you next year."
"I have stayed at many hotels in Bali, but i found The Bene to be probably the best i have stayed at so far. It is close to the heart of everything and also close to the beach. It is hidden away at the end of a laneway which makes this place nice and peaceful.
The pool closes at 9pm which is good as it can get noisy if open later than this. The staff are friendly ad it has a basement for scooter and car parking.
The breakfast is average, i only ate there once in my week stay. much better options close by at reasonable prices. 
I didn't try the spa but it seemed good value for what you get.
I would definately stay again and highly recommend The Bene."
"My 5th trip to Bali, stayed at The Bene Hotel, had seen it previously and the position was good.
Unknown to me , my Daughter in Australia had arranged for a Birthday Surprise with the Bene Staff, I returned from my morning walk at around lunchtime to find my room completely decorated with streamers, balloons a Bunch of Flowers and Happy Birthday with rose petals across my bed, it was a wonderful surprise.
A few minutes later i answered a knock on the door and there were 5 Staff members with a Birthday cake with candles and they came in Singing Happy Birthday.
The Bene Hotel Staff go above and beyond their duty to make their customers happy.
Breakfast was good, especially the last breakfast included Baked Beans."
"I had an awesome stay in Bali. The Bene Hotel is so cosy.. staffs are very cheerful. My check in was a breeze.  I was attended by 2 ladies.. Desi and Ari. Both of them very cheerful and funny. We had alot of laughter during our check in. Not like other city front desk. They are very happy people and always make me happy to talk to them. 
Breakfast was ok ok. I dont eat my breakfast after the 3rd day. Not much choice. Waited long to get a seat. Overall staffs at restaurant was very helpful.
I will definitely recommend my friends and relative to stay in Bene hotel."
"Our stay at The Bene Hotel has been a pleasant one. We have a great variety of breakfast buffet choices over the 3-days stay and the facilities and hotel areas are clean and spacious. We have had a lot of luggage with us this time but the room was clean and spacious for us. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Location is excellent with the Kuta beach, restaurants, cafes and shopping mall within walking distance. Definitely a place to consider if we were to travel to Bali again!"
"We stayed at the Bene for 4 nights and had a wonderful time there. The hotel was close to the beach but in a private and quiet area. The facilities were very nice and clean, no complaints there. Pool was big and clean, and pretty much relaxed and quiet. We stayed in two different rooms and both were very nice with great views of the pool. The only complaint was that the tvs don't work very well, like the signal was very weak or something... but that wasn't a huge deal for us.
Staff was friendly and professional, and they were very prompt. We have stayed in a lot of hotels across southeast Asia and the Bene was maybe the best for the money (we paid around $45US per night as it's the off-season). There are also lots of stores, laundry and other things nearby so it's very convenient. One other quibble, don't use the taxi service across the street, they are a ripoff. Use bluebird taxi or download Grab app for much cheaper taxis!"
"The hotel has nice location, 5 mins from beach by feet and walking distance from shopping places. The staff is friendly in good way. We also tried another hotel for a couple of days and it was much worse than Bene although price being about the same. 

The location is also peaceful compared to other areas in Kuta where street vendors are really annoying. 

in addition to all, the pool area is really nice and there was nice balcony in the room directing to the pool. 

The only con was the slow WiFi."
"The Bene Hotel - overall rating was 8.5/10 personally for me, there are a few key excellent points for the Bene,
The hotel was VERY nice, peaceful, quiet, and SAFE. there is only one way in and one way out of the hotel, and it has full-time very friendly and always readily to help security guards. the staff was pleasant during check-in. 
Pool was awesome, this hotel is kinda like a isolated hotel, you'll have to spend some time looking for it, if it's your first time there. which is great is you're looking to get away from the hustle n bustle of city life, yet with the convenience in a city. but once you are accustomed to the surroundings, it has a great location because of the 'one way in one way out direction'.
They have cable TV, bathroom was adequately supplied and the bed was very comfortable. Room Service/Housekeeping was excellent.
it is just 5-10mins walk away from Kuta Beach and Legian Street for shopping and nightlife, it took me 15mins to walk to Sky Garden. Less than 3mins walk away from a ""7-eleven"" and a 15mins walk to Beachwalk Shopping Centre. 
Areas to improve:
Breakfast was great, (if you're not a picky eater) but could be better if there are more variety in it.
Staff were generally pleasant and helpful, but I can't get away from the stigma that every time you asked for something, they will expect a tip from you (u can see it in their eyes).
WIFI is VERY BAD. i'm sorry, but they really have to improve in this matter, I require wifi for this short getaway trip, and I ended up patrolling a restaurant nearby JUST FOR THE WIFI. 
they gave me a room, room 330, which the sun directly shines in my room from morning to afternoon, and it's VERY hot. but it was perchance i needed to tan, so I can just sit in my balcony for a tan, but it gets too hot in midday. 
Overall: a great hotel to begin with, very good location, service and environment. Good job."
Good place to stay for a quiet time. Yet close to walk to beach and shops. Great staff and all amenities good Bali standard. Only 2 issues for us were a hard bed and limited breakfast options.
"In room facilities very bad, bathroom shower broken"
"It’s affordable accommodation and you get what you pay for. It’s clean, nothing spectacular, everything basic you need from the hotel in Kuta but not much more. We stayed for one night, just for sleep over and for that purpose it was ok. I wouldn’t come back though and I probably forget about this hotel in the matter of weeks."
The hotel room is clean. Location wise is also good. Family orientated. Lots of amenities nearby.  Walking distance to kuta beach
old hotel with lack of maintenance
I will come again
"Before you do your booking check the other comments and my comment. I have stayed at this place for two nights, and I don’t recommend it for the following reasons:
- There’s no hot water (it’s just a little warm).
- The water is really salty (Which makes the hair and skin dry).
- The noise from the pool and dump from the top raft is happening every half hour. (they can’t make you sleep). 
- The toilet doesn’t have bidet spray!!!
- The pillow has very very dirty parts. 
- This place totally not comfortable.
When I complained to the hotel, I never heard anything from them, so, I checked out even I still have three more nights, after I checked out the hotel manager followed me to just say, there’s no refund and the water is not salty!!! Please!! Learn how to handle the customers who issues and fix it to have a good business."
"I cannot compliment the place enough, the staff are amazing, the breakfast sensational, the pool access rooms are incredible and just a few minutes from the beach and restaurants everything you need at the door. There are only 2 places that I will stay in Legian after trying many and this is one of them. 
I had an issue with the booking at my next hotel and the staff called ahead for me to sort it out."
"Good location but it’s big hotel and crowded, the rooms next to elevators are noisy all the time and the air conditioning is noisy as well, the stuffs are friendly."
"Good hospitality, nice food services, pool facility is child friendly. But skip for cleaning my room once and they said that it was due to heavy visitors in holiday time 😅"
Excellent hotel in a quiet but central area. Could walk to everything and it was right in the action. Staff were really great and rooms were perfect for us. Will definitely stay again
The hotel is family friendly. Good location with 3 mints walk to Kuta beach. There is a shopping centre and many food eateries in the area. Hotel rooms are clean. Price wise is good. Hotel staffs are friendly and welcoming.
You need to go through the alley to reach the hotel. I feel that it is not very safe to walk out at night. The toilet facilities are very old. There are many mosquitoes!  I keep getting bitten by mosquitoes!
"Dekat pantai
Hotel good banget
Staff good
Dekat kemana aja 
Room yg good"
"The Bene was a great place to stay, and would highly recommend it"
Best deh semuanya
Stayed in the Royal suite. Only have 1 king and 2 single bed. So if you have 5 person. You need to have extra beds. Otherwise the 5th will be sleeping on a couch. Staff very nice a friendly. Breakfast is good. Location good. Water from shower is salty. Walking distance to Kuta beach about 7-8mins. Overall value for money.
"This hotel is very pleasant, our room was pool access and we can chill at the pool side which is just outside our room, close to beach, about 5 - 10 mins walk, n if u r not doing any sideseeing, can relax at the beach for whole day, which we did for a few days during our stay. Close proximity to shopping center nd u can get lots of food n good coffee there, as well as night Market food stall outside the shopping center. convenient stores just nearby. overall I wl rate it a hotel value with money n location"
"Very spacious , very comfort & also only 5 minutes walk to Kuta Beach!"
Very spacious and comfortable room. We love it.
Good
"Let me start by saying the staff are wonderful and are doing a great job.. but the hotel not so good.. rooms are clean and tidy but small with limited storage space for bags and clothing, the bed was like sleeping on the floor and the shower was warm at best even after asking about the hot water a number of times.. the pool area decking is dangerous in some area's.
Breakfast was ok.. restaurant didn't have some things on the menu and they even ran out of beer. The hotel is also undergoing renovations so on day it is a little noisy but not bad... 
Look the hotel has potential but for me this time it wasn't for me so a 4 out of 10 and you only got a 4 because of the wonderful staff."
"The Bene Hotel 15 min from HRC by walk, 5min walk to Legian area, We stay for Royal Suite Room and the room very spacious"
"Good value, clean and wonderful people.  The pool access rooms are fantastic if you want to chill and relax.  Small walk to all the action."

"As per previous review, our room was not available until after 3 pm.  The following day we put up the notice that we would like our room cleaned as we left at 0800.  We returned at 3 pm and room was not cleaned.  Very upsetting.  Someone finally knocked on door at 5pm to clean and we refused as we were exhausted and hot and tired from being out all day.  We paid for an extra night as our flight out of Bali was not until 7pm, but were told we couldn’t stay in our room for an extra few hours because it was booked for the last night   On checking on agoda, we found it was available.   We would have no complaints if we were treated better, but did not have our room cleaned, no towels replaced, no water given for the 3 nights we paid for."
