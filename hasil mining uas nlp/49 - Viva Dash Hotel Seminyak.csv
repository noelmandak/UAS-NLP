"I can be pretty picky as I work remote, so I have a few extra needs like consistent wifi and and enough amenities to allow me to get what I need quickly and get back to work.
Viva Dash checks all the boxes for me. Great location in the heart of Seminyak. I can easily walk to nearby restaurants or coffeeshops. Then after a long day I can walk to some nearby bars and clubs, but more importantly is being able to walk back and avoid the horde of taxis and bikes offering rides...
* Also free bottles of water daily which is a game changer after a long night out...
I had great treatment from Bagus (apologies if I spelled it wrong) and the rest of the staff, not one bad experience during my stay. 
I wish I was less busy and got to enjoy the rooftop bar more often. 
As a pale American I got a good chance to work on my tan at the rooftop pool. If you avoid the sun like many others, they have a pool located in the center of the hotel (still outdoors) where you can enjoy the shaded seating. Pro tip - Try the restaurant adjacent to the lobby. If you're bad at pool like I am, you can work on your shot when no one is looking.
I can confidently say I'll be back and I look forward to seeing all of the staff again. Bagus, and the 3rd floor room cleaners always brightened up my mood."
Right in the heart of fun. Great facilities. Used the gym while it rained and then headed out. Comfy room. Everything was top notch! I will be back!
"I've stayed at Dash Hotel a couple of times already and I love that it's so close to the beach and not far from the main shopping area. There are heaps of bars and restaurants around, cafes are just around the corner. Seminyak is such a walkable town so accessibility really isn't an issue. With Dash being on a main road, I have no qualms walking back from the bar because there'll definitely be people around and the streets are well-lit so I feel safe. 
The rooms I've stayed in are also super clean, no concerns whatsoever with bugs or dirt. I love the balcony, cos it means my swimwear definitely dries overnight. The rooftop lounge is perfect for a simple chill sesh to watch the stunning Balinese sunsets, and the iconic red pool downstairs is sizeable and good for proper swimming. 
Staff here are always friendly, always have tips, and always ready to help."
"Hotel is awesome for those young travellers on budget in Seminyak area.
It is chic, cool complete with pool for cooling down & socialise.
Its located in the heart of Seminyak close to beach clubs, shops and beach."
"Had a great time staying at Viva Dash, very nice spacious room, good location, quite hard to fault. Would definitely stay again."
"This place was outstanding.  The hostel is very much targeting a trendy 20 - 40 year old crowd.  Breakfast was very good with a huge a la carte menu (though lattes cost extra for some reason).  The rooftop bar has great drinks, but north american pricing (like most of Seminyak).  The pools are on the small side, but they are usually empty.  Rooms are great with super comfortable beds.  One thing to note is the bathroom and bedroom are the same room.  Not sure why this terrible fad has caught on, but it does not leave you with much privacy when sharing with a friend...  Highly recommended!"
Clean rooms with excellent staff. The rooms are very well equipped and the hotel facilities are great. Great location too. Can't recommend enough.
"It was a pleasant stay at Dash hotel. It is surrounded by many attractive places. What I like from this hotel is their cleanliness, service, and location. It is recommended."
Staff were super friendly and helpful. Location perfect!! Would definitely stay here again
A very very quirky adult themed hotel (which made it better in my opinion!). The breakfast every morning was a highlight. The room was very spacious and clean. The bar at the rooftop pool made great cocktails! Great hotel in a good location. Would come back again next time we are in bali!
Great location and amazing room!
"First time in Bali. We stayed for 2 nights
Pros:  
1. Great all-you-can-eat ala carte breakfast spread. Especially love the Acai bowl.
2. Strategic location in Seminyak, cafes, gelatos, beach all within walking distance.
3. Helpful front desk. Got us a quiet room as requested.
Cons:
1. Pillows are too soft. Called front desk for a hard pillow for my girlfriend but the staff gave us another soft one. Perhaps, a miscommunication."
"The staff were absolutely on top of everything; most responsive. The room was spotless. The breakfast was good. On my last night, a few hundred dollars dropped from  my wallet in a hallway while I was searching for my room key. A staff member found it and returned it to the front desk. They called me the next morning and returned every penny after verifying it was all there. I was already going to rate the experience 5 stars but I felt compelled to write this review after that."
"The rooms are well designed, it’s always clean and super helpful friendly staff.  Very good location to the action  without pandemic. I regularly stay here and they treat me like a VIP"
best locations great services
"Location and staff is excellent if you want to be in Seminyak.
Room was upgraded, facing the pool, on the highest floor with a bathtub.
Check out the restaurant. For Muslim it is halal (though served alcohol). The food is delicious and reasonably price for Seminyak standard.
We had a great stay. Will comeback again."
great value over all
"I had the best stay at the Dash Hotel in Seminyak, everything worked super well from spontaneous early check in to storing the luggage after check out. The pool is a Dream and so are the rooms. Their F&B is great and the staff is super helpful and motivated. Loved everything about my stay here."
"The staff are amazing they will go out of their way to help you however you need at whatever time. The rooftop bar is lovely and the food is tasty. Terrific location next to potato head and the W and around the corner from Mrs Sippy, great for party goers, young couples or those who like to relax. Second time staying and I will be back"
"Fine hotels, room fabulous, my sons Like it"
"nice Hotel in a great location, with lots of places to go to that are not to far away. Friendly Staff and clean rooms."
Overall everything is good. Friendly and helpful staff. Great location. Love their breakfast so much. Spacious room and comfortable bed. Definitely will come back again
"Hotel is filled with artistic decos, everything is chic and Instagram able! Only thing is the floors inside the rooms aren’t very clean, felt like it’s filled with a layer of dust, therefore I have to wear slipper all around. Other than that the hotel is perfect! Good customer service, good food! The rooftop bar is also worth a visit with a jacuzzi! Will definitely recommend the stay!"
"Staff go above and beyond here, we had an issue with noisy people, and they took care of the issue so promptly. Could not recommend this place any higher 10/10"
"Selalu nginep disini kalau ke bali. Food is fantastic, room is great and the staff is awesome..."
Strategic location.
"It's located in the heart of Seminyak, right in front of Potato Head. Also there are a lot of restaurants and bar in the area. I'm recommending this to you."
My third time back in Bali and still chose Dash Hotel! The location and service is good. Hotel Breakfast is the thing I look forward to the most every morning.
"Everything was perfect..staff, clean, breakfast..i love it..i lovr the room.."
The staff are super friendly and helpful. The hotel is wonderful and is in a great location near the beach.
Best location ever
"It's a comfy hotel, great location"
I liked this hotel as it's walking distance to most places including the gym I went to : :)
I'll definitely stay here again!
Love the pop style design of this hotel!! Nicely located and cozy stay!
Our studio room was smaller than seen in pics but it was enough as we stayed there for 4 days.
"It was a trendy hotel, but it feels a little old. The cost-effectiveness is good."
"This hotel has a cool vibe, pop art decoration is awesome. Though i would say is more for young people than family i still enjoyed the roof top bar and pool a lot."
"Quirky little hotel, would love to stay here again"
Good position and service
"Great view, great location"
"Love this hotel so much. Love the decor. Love the staffs.
The hotel gave me positive vibes with bright colors and interesting theme of the room. We were given welcome drink when we check in and the drinks were so refreshing. Just wat i need to start the day. Check in process was a breeze and was given an upgrade as it was my wedding anniversary! Totally recommend it to my friends and families!"
"Nice rooms, clean hotel, location perfect! Defiantly would recommend to stay especially for the price."
"Loved the room, comfortable bed.  Very friendly staff"
"Comfy rooms, great facilities and amazing staff"
Everything was even better than we expected!
It's a fun hotel to stay in.
Will definitely stay. here again!
"We stayed for 03 Nights, close to everything, wonderful services, good food, frendily staff. Though we not able to spend much time in hotel, but we had great stay & recommend others to opt for."
"Pros: great staff. Whatever I wanted, they could accommodate. Super cool decor, industrial, graffiti, all super fun!
Cons: the moldy smell in the showers, that’s something someone would really need to look at. I was in 3 rooms and all 3 had the same issues. Not cool..."
"Location is fab. Design is very creative. The staffare very helpful and accommodating and breakdast is superb. A good hotel for solo traveller, couples or even the whole family. Have already recommended to my friend who are staying there this January."
"Awesome location, hotel is good with nice ambience and comfy rooms. I didn't like the food though. But their are many great places around it to enjoy. Overall very good experience. The beach is 10 minutes walk away."
Value for money. Had the room facing the street. Sound proofing acceptable. 5-10min walk to the beach. Toilet had continuous noise which could only be solved by closing the toilet water switch. Shower water outlet stuck initially which was resolved by engineering. Service good.
"Hotel is great, staffs are friendly, location is good & everything was fine. Just that room a little bit run down. Need to improve amenity. And this is the first time i had a bad experienced upon check out. Front desk staff told me that housekeeper can’t find the kimono in the room that i stay. Me & family arrived latenite check in approached to the room & all of us didn’t see any was hanging at the open closet, not even one. With cooperation letting the staff insist check on every of my luggages & not found any. This really makes upset with the hotel & not acceptable. Hope that hotel management will look into this matter, is the room everything is ready in proper before guests checking in."
"Have stayed there for the third time, a good quirky and cute hotel situated in the prime Seminyak area near popular beach clubs and brunch restaurants
Keep in mind that their operation is in a bare minimum since there is only 2 hotel staff and 1 security and we weren't provided breakfast since the restaurant is closed
Overall good experience for short stay"
"Tenny The Day manger makes this Hotel become successful - very good location , enjoyed our 10 nights here!"
"We needed a place for 1 night that was centrally located on the main street (without having to rent a scooter) and clean, with good reviews. We're happy we stayed here and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast (after a long flight of airplane food). You basically pick anything you want from a pretty wide selection of options from the Restaurant Menu.
The rooms were quite small, but Ok. Usual amenities were provided, but nothing more. The toilet has a partition wall next to the shower, but doesn't have a door for privacy...so if you're staying here, make sure you're Ok with a toilet with no door! We were in the ground floor without any view, so it felt a bit cooped up & stuffy down there."
"An interesting hotel concept, too bad it was during covid. Seminyak is like a ghost town."
Location..good ..... breakfast spread good .
You have to like way out decore to feel comfortable here
"Due to pandemic we are unable to ask for plates, spoon and fork, the staff were shorthanded. The pool was not cleaned regularly and the water tasted weird. However the location is perfect and the decoration amazing, thank you"
"This hotel is super close to potato head and W. it is also close to seminyak square. good location. However, i think the management changed and the property is not well maintained. They can improve on that. Staffs are super amazing and really helpful."
Great location!!
The location is perfect and right across Potato Head Beach Club and many restaurants.
"This was our second time staying here.  Since 2015, wear and tear has taken its toll.  Unlike the newness before, this time, a persistent odour pervaded our room.  Upon investigation, it was coming from the toilet and the floor trap in the bathroom.  It smelt like someone had attempted to mask the sewer smell with a sickeningly sweet smelling chemical.  They must be credited with responding to my feedback.  However, what they did wasn't too effective.  Until this problem is fixed permanently, I suggest you pick from the numerous other 4* properties in and around the area.
The sink top laminate was in bad shape from repeated exposure to water and the rear of the wash basin didn't look too hygienic.  From observation, I feel Housekeeping needs tighter supervision. The lighting in the room was inadequate and inappropriately positioned.  Other than the above, they get 5* for their all-you-can-eat ala carte breakfast and spacious rooms."
"Really cheap for a nice room
Staff were top notch, absolute champions"
"Great spot, very central, opposite Potato head."
Great stay and fun filled room.
It was my second visit to this Hotel. A perfect short stay for those wanting to be at the heart of Seminyak's best restaurants.  Staff was courteous and efficient in handling my queries.
"Get the larger room, it is overall worth it."
Cleanliness and food needs improvement but definitely worth the price that you paid.
"Good, taxi fare is steep in the area."
Lovely hotel for couples. Friendly staff especially Suci. Keep up the awesomeness!
Good location yet the hotel facilities were not open fully.  Room appliances were dusty and not maintained when we checked in. .. no restaurant serving food or anything else other than the pool....hotel was empty other that afew guests...but service of staff was great..... there were little cockroaches in our room tho but house keeping came to spray insecticide ...
"Can get better deal, the facilities are not so good"
"Nice hotel, but low service and noisy sanitary - very loud noise from pipes couldn’t sleepall night! Stayed at city view room 525. Local and views nice!"
Nothing great
"Nice hotel but the flush system is poor and we can hear noises from pathway at night. However, the breakfast is good with wide variety and tasty."
Toilet seat was broken and comes off. Ass kept touching toilet bowl few times. Noisy. First receptionist not friendly. The rest were good.
"Unfortunately . Everything written about this hotel privileges is incorrect. I am not talking about the employees of the hotel because their treatment is good, but my words are on the hotel itself, because it does not have any degree of privilege to be a four-star hotel, as this in itself is a great shock to us and with all regret those who gave this hotel a four-star class and they are the central company for tourist hotels only my question To them how did you give this grade to this hotel. The problem is that I booked this hotel before another hotel in Kuta and it was three stars, but everything was better than this hotel. Did you see a four-star hotel, its breakfast is very bad?"
"First of all all the facilities are CLOSED, even the swimming pool. And they said the elevator is under maintenance,so i have to walk up the stairs to the 3rd floor. They have spider webs in the microwave. The AC in the master bedroom is not working and they have NO HOT WATER in the shower so I tried calling the receptionist but no one pick up , because there are no staff at all at night , no receptionist, no housekeeping,only 1 security guard outside, when i complain about the AC the security said the engineering cannot come.
Honestly what shocks me the most is that they have NO STAFF at all after 4pm, this is truly the worst hotel I’ve been in , I dont think they’re ready to open."
The hotel was undergoing renovation however still listed on Agoda. I had to quickly find alternative accommodation after arriving.
"On our last day in bali we booked this hotel recommended by our driver. Im not very picky with hotel but i usually book accomodation one night then move on to another if i didnt like something, or if i dont feel comfortable. But its a diff dtory with dash, I love The hotel ambiance, designs and art decor. The room is amazing it has a hippie design i love the upside down bunny! I wished we moved to seminyak earlier.Location is great right in front of potato head walking distance in seminyak square but i recommend to hire motor bike.you get a 15 mins welcome head and shoulder massage and a cute refreshing welcome drink. Mya restaurant is right next to it where the buffet breakfast is , i recommend to book your stay with breakfast as the selections are excellent.the service is superb! Amazing staff, very helpful, always ready to assist you and you can see that they love working there.we checked out noon but our flt is midnight out of bali. Unfortunately no late check out option but they can store your baggage in the hotel for as long as we needed and was offered a shower to refresh ourselves before our flight. Id like to say thank to dash hotel. The people there made our stay enjoyable, they made sure we are comfortable during our stay the warm greetings the smile and their positive energy which radiates to everyone is just amazing. I recommend this hotel and will stay here when i come back to bali.thank you once again."
"We stayed for our honeymoon at Dash Hotel, in September 2017. I lost my luggage at airport and we had to phone our airplane firm several times.  The stuff offered us making phone calls themselves and on the same day they gave the good new when we return to the hotel, our luggage had found! :) The staff on the terrace cafe, restaurant and for cleaning was so kindly, too.  You will see this friendly people everywhere in Bali :)Breakfast was good and had enough variety.  Location is next to the Seminyak Beach and it's the most excellent advantage of Dash Hotel. You should see the sunset on the Seminyak Beach and taste its delicious kitchen. Rooms have different and joyful consept as you can see the photos. Bed is so comfortable. Our room's view was so satisfied. We had only problem about our doorhandle, it was broke down two or three times. But they fixed it and offered us a new room if we want but it was okay. Thank you Dash Hotel for the great memories and your hospitality.! :))"
"The positive reviews are 100% genuine! 
We changed plans last minutes after 1 night in our original option. Dash saved our (5) days in seminyak by
A) being walking distance to everything we needed 
B) having a rooftop bar and Lounge area where we spent two fantastically lazy afternoons sipping cocktails by the shallow roof top pool
C) arranging a private taxi to ubud for a 300 IDR flat date which we paid direct to the hotel (cash or card) 

We have had 2 nights in ubud but enjoyed our stay at the dash so much so, that we have booked our final 4 nights before departing back to the UK, back at the dash. 

Note: we are not great at pre planning. Being at the dash allowed us the wake up and enjoy our preference for the day: shops, beach, potatohead club, ku de ta, water sports, the pool, the rooftop sun bathing, the gym, the spa or just simply eating at all the great local joints. 
Check out fat turtle, boss man (burgers) and Mexicola!!!!"
"If you would like to stay in Seminyak, Dash Seminyak must be in your top list!  A very trendy hotel with pretty design, all staff are super friendly especially Ayu at the front counter.  Very spacious room and the separate toilet and shower room is a plus point.  Comfortable bed and pillows and a little surprise in your room.  The breakfast is awesome!  Not buffet style but all you can eat from the menu.  The Mya restaurant adjacent to Dash Hotel serves very delicious food.  You mustn't miss a meal at this place.  Stone throw away to massage centre, good restaurants, and convenience store.  Definitely will come back to this hotel for it strategic location, warm welcome, and trendy stay."
"Stayed at Dash Hotel for 8 days when I went to Bali to dive and this was one of the best decision of the trip. The design of the hotel and room were really unique and fun and it was a really comfortable stay there. 
Staff were courteous and friendly and I really like the 24 hour restaurant / cafe. At times during the night when I can't sleep, I can easily pop down to the restaurant for some late night supper / drinks to just chill and relax. 
Not only that, it's really close to all the nice cafes / restaurants around the area and also to Seminyak Square. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the hotel. But only down thing is the TV in the room which isn't working very well but not a big issue to me."
"We were there in Bali during our anniversary and the management and staff at Dash hotel gave us a pleasant surprise when they put in a little something extra in our room. The location of the hotel was great, just right across from Potato Head Beach Club and walking distance from W Hotel and a host of other restaurants and shops. The rooftop bar was superb for a chill out. The room is as per the pictures show and very spacious. The only thing that was a little underwhelming was the swimming pool which looked like it could use a little refreshing. Otherwise, a brilliant hotel to stay at when you're in Seminyak"
"First time in bali~ stayed in Dash Hotel Seminyak for 1 night, i knew i made the right choice because i stayed in Dash Resort Langkawi before and it was amazing! So i decided to chose dash hotel seminyak for a night. The staffs are all very welcoming & we got a free upgrade. It was very nice of them. I would defnitely recommend to my friends and families. Thank you for everything dash team :)"
"I booked this hotel because of all the good reviews. And I would say that this hotel exceeds my expectation. We are served welcome drink and chocolate when we arrived, and our room got upgraded! The room is clean with unique interior and the bed & pillows are comfortable. We got a room on high floor facing sea, so we got to see sunset every day. All the staffs are very friendly and helpful. Location is strategic, walking distance to beach and nice cafes in Seminyak. We have a wonderful stay, definitely would come again. Thank you, Dash Hotel!"
"I’ve been to Bali several times and have only ever stayed in a villa before. Dash Hotel was the first ‘hotel’ I looked at when I wanted to stay in a room this trip because its facade and branding is so eye catching and memorable. Very young, funky vibes, and friendly staff. 
Location wise it is right across Potato Head Club (if watered down cocktails aren’t your thing, you can still use it as an easy access point to and from the beach), down the road from W Bali and Merah Putih (you must eat here!). Walking to the city centre is fairly simple - just follow the road, google maps, or ask the staff! Perhaps 10 mins stroll? 
Accessibility is not an issue, staff speak perfect English, they can arrange for two-way airport transfer at a fee, if you want to hail a taxi, insist on a Blue Bird and the staff will help tell the driver in Bahasa Indonesia where you want to go. 
I’d return!"
"Thumbs up! I like the hotel design and all the amenities they provided. The staffs are really friendly and helpful. They smiled and greeted us every single time. We are given refreshing lime cooler and complimentary 15 mins head and neck massage once we checked in. There is this incident before we left Bali, me and my boyfriend rented a scooter to go around Bali and on our last night, we had flat tyre outside Uluwatu. We got our problem settled with the help of local friends (frustrated but luckily it's settled) because we couldn't contact the bike rental company. The next day we told the front desk of what we encountered the night before and they helped us to call the balibikerental and figured out the unreachable reason. Very satisfied with service and hospitality of Dash Hotel, definitely will recommend to friends and family."
"Our stay at the dash hotel was certainly a great experience. All of the staff were super friendly, the food at both dining locations was amazing, the rooms were of a high standard and kept that way every day. I will be recommending the hotel to all my friends and family and we will definitely be staying there next time we visit Seminyak. I believe that if you book with Dash Hotel you will have the same experience as what my partner and I had during the month of February 2016"
"Our stay at Dash Seminyak Bali Hotel was beyond expectation. All aspects of an excellent hotel was met,  such as:
✔️ Quick check-in & check out
✔️ Strategic location at the heart of Seminyak
✔️ Artsy interior design
✔️ Excellent room design and cleanliness
✔️ Excellent breakfast menu
✔️ Excellent service from hotel staff"
"First of all, the whole concept of Dash hotel is really quirky and fun. The little gestures from the staff made the stay a whole lot better. From the plush bunny toy given to my niece upon checking in to the welcome drinks, nothing bad can be said about this place. Really love the whole concept and design of the hotel, would definitely make it a point to come back here for another stay. Location is good too, just diagonally opposite Potato Head. The area wasn't too noisy nor quiet, it was just nice. If you're looking for a hotel in Seminyak, this should be at the top of your list."
"We really enjoyed our stay at Dash! It was close to everything we wanted to explore in Seminyak. Close to the Beach, good eats coffee and yoga!
The staff was so kind and attentive. We were able to get anything we needed to make our stay cozy any time. Our street side room was a bit loud because of older doors but we picked the spot. 
The vibe is so carefree and funky that it ended our honeymoon in Bali to perfection! Thanks Dash!!!"
"We got a cool room balcony facing the red pool so that's already a plus for us. Love how close Dash Hotel Seminyak is to other restos, shops and what's happening in Seminyak. Transportation not a problem here as there are many Blue Bird taxis or Grab cars in the area. Breakfast, while ala cart  is order as you can so yayyyy! Will def come back! 👍👍"
"Dash Hotel got my attention because of its avant-garde interiors. But the time you artive in the hotel, my experience just got so much better. I arrived early due to my flight. They were able to accommodate my early check-in request, gave a small sweet welcome drink, and a 15-minute complimentary head and shoulders massage. 
I felt they were happy to see me. They were all smiles from the receptionist down to the room service guys. It was an absolutely good experience to see those warm smiles from you walk fown the corridor to welcoming back to hotel.
I also loved the red bunny that was everywhere, in the room (plush toy) to that huge figure by the pool.
Checkout was a breeze, too. 
Dasg Hotel is promising! You have to experience it when you're in Bali."
"This is my 2nd stay at Dash & am glad we came back.  We nearly got scammed at another hotel nearby (Sense Hotel Seminyak - as they were trying to pull a stunt to get me to pay them again, even tho I had fully paid for my stay before the trip), so we decided to move to Dash and weren't disappointed. Rooms were great - the shower area did 'flood' slightly tho, but not  a big issue, beds were comfy, location is excellent - walking distance to a lot of restaurants, bars, shops, and very helpful reception staff. Overall a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend and return for a 3rd stay!"
"My first holiday in Bali didn’t disappoint, thanks to Dash Hotels.  
Let me first say I didn’t even go bar-hopping. I had intended to stay in the hotel to enjoy the amenities, and to take a much deserved rest. 
I thoroughlu enjoyed the food, the baudy-yet-tasteful artwork, the pool and the gym. Staff demonstrated fantastic hospitality and friendliness, and excellent service. 
I would DEFINITELY come back to this hotel during my next sojourn in Bali. Hopefully, I’ll stay a little longer then."
"The Dash Seminyak is a quirky place in a charming part of Seminyak beach. Steps away from great breakfast places like Gourmet Cafe and beach clubs like Potatohead, it is its own oasis with two pools, one on the ground level and a small one on the rooftop. The vibe is clearly for couples and a younger audience but plenty of families were staying at the hotel. The staff are friendly and accommodated our asks. Would certainly come back for another stay!"
"Rooms are nice and big, while some reviews talked about how young/teenager-y the room artwork was, it wasn't an issue for us - we saw many families there too. Lots of popular food joints (Cafe Organic, AYA, Fat Turtle, Bumbu, Biku) nearby, away from the noise of Seminyak Square yet an easy walk there if you like. We got the room at a really affordable price, would totally recommend Dash to friends!"
The hotel is clean and the toilet is big for the family room. The location is great as there are many eateries around. The beach is nearby and there's a mall within 15 mins walk. Highly recommended to stay in this hotel!
"Upon check in. Aircon not working well. Thus change to another room. 
They only compensate 1 day breakfast where i stay 2 nights.. nake no sense .
Next on my last night. The room blackout upon tapping in after 1 whole day out. I was stuck in lobby for almost 1 hour while they repaired it .. weeeeeee. So fun. Everyday diff issues.. =)"
"Well maintained, very hip hotel. They renovated post covid, makes the place brighter and more welcoming. Well done"
"Hotel location is great with many restaurants and cafes nearby. The r
Family consists of 2 bedrooms, kitchenette small living room. Room is clean and spacious. The only minus point is the water pressure in shower room. Water becomes hot and cold and different water pressure. Other than that all is good."
"Spacious loft-style rooms, good sized pool and close to the centre of Seminyak. Could do with better TV"
Nice hotel! Staffs are so friendly and helpful! Loved our stay here! Thank you Dash Hotel
"Great location, next to bar and clubs, but a little noisy at night"
"Had a wonderful time in Viva Dash.
Good
Room - was spacious and everything provided. 
Location - is central in Seminyak easy to get anywhere. Potato Head Beach Club is just across the street from the hotel 5mins by foot.
Pool, Gym, Sun Deck Rooftop - are all very eye catching and insta worthy
Staff - everyone is smiling and so helpful and polite
Bad
Wifi - not so stable. 
Overall the hotel is definitely value for money. Will probably come back!!!"
"Staff was very helpful and ever ready to offer their assistance, location was at a quiet street off the main Seminyak village area, near attractions like motel mexicola and potato head"
Super value for money and in good location of seminyak with lots of food around to choose. Staff is friendly and nice. A convenience mart beside hotel.
"We have enjoyed this hotel very good
Clean and staf friendly and helpful😍😎"
"I heard from the staff that the owner has changed, however i don‘t think it‘s for the best. Room are very dusty when we came i even can‘t sleep the first night. It was clear that they never vacuum the curtains and clean the windows. Floor also very dusty. Bed headboard was made of alumunium/ steel/ some thin metal it keeps making noise,so annoying. Wifi also not good enough."
"The location is definitely one of the best in the area. It is super near the beach clubs and are near laundry, massage, convenience stores and more. The rooftop bar has amazing views as well. While there were some hiccups during checkin, this was resolved by the staff asap and they were kind enough to provide us with a room upgrade. Staff were always friendly helpful and approachable too. Only downside is the nature of the toilet, the warehouse/grunge design does give the impression that cleanliness is not the best. Other than that, we love the comfy bed and how inviting the room is."
Not good
"Located right on the main street of seminyak area, walking distance to beach, surrounded by restos and bars.
Got parking spots for cars, convenient stores just right beside the entrance
Standard facilites pool gym
Funky eccentric artsy room theme and decoration
Shower could be better, experienced some problems with the shower/warm water
Overall nothing serious
Good value for price"
"Nice boutique hotel in the middle of Seminyak, walking distance to many nice restaurants and clubs. Gym was basic but OK for a few days, room a little smaller than expected but nice and clean with a comfortable bed. TV was a little old and had no option for casting. Very helpful and friendly staff. Unfortunately, no breakfast buffet. Had a good time here and could consider again."
Wonderful place to stay. Very clean. Staff are super attentive. Nice pool and rooftop lounge. Would definitely stay again!
"Best stay in Bali! Rooms, amenities , food,  staff and everything is just perfect! Very well kept Hotel! And the Roofdeck sunset view is just so nice as well. Will definitely go back!"
