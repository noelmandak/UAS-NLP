"Pros : Strategic location - walking distance to restaurants, shops and beach. The pool is clean and beautiful, the staffs are kind, breakfast is delicious.
Our air conditioner didn't work, the hotel staff responded promptly despite full occupancy during holiday season.
Cons : WiFi doesn't work in the balcony, the gym is small with very limited equipments."
"The rooms were clean, very comfortable, ,huge jacuzzi, delicious breakfast and the staff was amazing and friendly . They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting  Sanur. 
Special thanks to front desk Ms Naima and Mr koje."
"Add to that, great staff, excellent breakfast, clean & comfortable rooms... what more could you ask for, especially at the very reasonable prices they offer!"
"Kamar bagus, jacuzzi bagus, view nya juga bagus, kolam renang nya top, lobby dan pelayanan nya mantap! Dapat free bfast mantap."
"The hotel is nice and cozy, breakfast is great and the pool is amazing. Although it seems its an old hotel however its well maintained"
The lagoon pools were fabulous. Staff lovely. Buffet breakfast yummy. Shops and places to eat just outside the entrance. Beach a short stroll away. Places to go for massage. Had a wonderful stay at Swiss-Belresort.
Their outside jacuzzi really great to enjoy the sunset time. their breakfast also nice.
"We had moved to this hotel after leaving a bad dirty hotel. This hotel was amazing and more than met our expectations. 
Clean, staff friendly and accomodating, we were upgraded to grand deluxe room. 
It was everything we needed for the night. Would recommend. Close to everything"
"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in the jacuzzi suite. Everything about the stay was perfect, including the friendly staff and pool/restaurant facilities. Overall we were very happy with the quality of the hotel and would recommend it to couples looking to stay in a quieter area of Bali"
"So close to everything, it was perfect. I will definetly stay again. I stayed at 4  different hotels in Bali and this was my Favourite!!!! Yummy bakery, chemist, mini supermarket etc all within 200mtrs walk. Pool  & pool bar were awesome, reception staff were amazing and  security staff were fantastic (translating for me when scooter hire guy came to pick up my scooter. & i accidently left key in ingintion once and security noticed and held onto it for me.  I really can not fault this hotel at all.  Room service was great. Amazing !!!"
"Hotel oke fasilitas oke, kolam renangnya super gede banget jd nyaman cuma gak ada perosotan buat kolam anak, kekurangan hotel ini klo mo ke pantai harus jalan sekitar 700 mtr jd klo yg mau hotel pinggir pantai sanur it’s not the option selebihnya oke value for money"
"Fantastic breakfast choice, the pool was spectacular, room clean, shower hot, bed firm."
"Friendly and helpful staff, amazing pool, great location. Will visit again"
"We stay at jacuzzi deluxe. We choose room that has been renovated. It was a comfortable room. Bed is comfortable. They still have room that has not been renovated with a bit worse condition. Location is very strategic, near minimarket and some restaurants within walking distance. Fabulous swimming pool, and wonderful breakfast. Definitely will stay here again"
"This is the 3rd time we have stayed here. 
Good rooms 
Great breakfast 
Great location 
Needs to be more cheaper around the pool bar to keep more people around it. 
Paul"
Very nice place and reasonable. All staff was very friendly and the hotel is secure
"If you’re looking for accommodation in Sanur that gives you great facilities and easy access to everything Sanur has to offer then Swiss Bel Watty Jimbar is for you. My partner and I have stayed here a number of times now. I recommend upgrading to a plunge pool room, it’s well worth it. The staff at Swiss Bel are friendly and very helpful and always welcome you with a smile.  You are only a minutes walk away from everything which is ideal."
"Can't beat the premium location, close to everything. Beautiful, crystal clean pool and lounge areas, huge restaurant area with robust breakfast spread, wonderful spa and friendly staff. Few areas under repair but nothing unusual."
"This hotel is highly recommended. We had a very clean room, a great quiet air conditioner, and a very comfortable and big bed. 
The room service was first class as was the attention to detail.
We were also very impressed with the speed at which concerns were dealt with. we had very minor issues, like reading light wasn't working and TV sound cut in and out, and these were fixed very quickly. We also returned one afternoon and our air conditioner had leaked a puddle of water on the floor and it was repaired immediately. 
The breakfast was tasty and expansive and the pool very clean. It was also good that there was always a pool chair available. 
The location is good with bars and eating places close by."
"best resort in town, near beach, best jacuzzi, great breakfast, friendly staff and have fun"
Don't hesitate to stay here. This hotel is good
clean and great staff
The location was great as there is so much within walking distance. The hotel also provides water stations which saves you buying more bottles and limits waste which is great. I also really loved the pool here- so beautiful and perfect spot to read your book.
we got free upgrade and free breakfast. how come not give five star review
"All pool side chairs were taken by blankets  owned by people who were not even in the pool.
Go to the pool after breakfast and see what I mean."
"Friendly staff, comfort room with jacuzzi.. Like it"
"Great resort staff and facilities 
A few things need a little attention 
Overall it was a great 2 weeks"
"very happy with our room. it was clean and beds were very comfortable. lovely pool, nice foyer, although only 5 min walk to beach, it also has its own beachfront sun lounge area with umbrellas. in main street area. shops nice and close."
Really enjoy this hotel. So near to the beach.
"Enjoy our stay, staff is friendly"
Happy to be back at our go to Hotel. We were worried Covid had taken its toll. But pleasantly surprised to see it had survived well. Although a little worn around the edges it has been loved by staff.Remained as we remembered it. Comfortable rooms.Aircon 5 star. Breakfast unbeatable. Staff great. Will return at our pleasure.
"Clean, good location"
"Nice swimming pool. Nice room with jacuzzi. Nice room with access to plunge pool. Strategic location in Sanur. Closed to many nice cafes. Great breakfast; nice bacon & omelette. Rice porridge need improvement though.
Check in time need to be faster. Staff could improve their hospitality and responsiveness.
Overall, great choice in Sanur. Would definitely come back if go to Bali again."
"We stayed for 2 nights in the pool view room. The room was clean, great pool but they need to take care of parking area and its support things, because it very dirty even my car had a lot of bat poops and made the paint broke. The other thing, they have no access to the beach so you need to take a walk little bit far from hotel to tye beach. But overall, for the price and location, I recomend this hotel to stay when you visit Sanur Bali"
Loved the huge pool and great location . Close to great restaurants and shops . Would definitely stay again
"2rd time we have stayed at this hotel & still very good / good room/ good breakfast/ good location 
Paul"
"Great hotel, amazing stuff, perfect breakfast. A big pool for our kids. The dinner buffet was also wonderful. We keep this hotel in mind 😀"
There is a jacuzzi in the room. The best with large room
"Loved this hotel. Was a great place to stay, close to everything and fantastic staff facilities and food"
We like the location of the hotel and the feel. It is a big hotel but it isn't too busy. Even though our room overlooked the pool we didn't find it noisy like many other hotels because the pool is so big and spread out.  Our room was spacious and we had lots of natural light. They now provide water dispensers in the hallways to fill up water jugs for your room- saving the environment from a lot of little plastic bottles- we thought this was a great idea.
"Staff are amazing & beds comfy, pools are fantastic. I will be back"
"fantastic pools , great staff, best location, breakfast good."
Wonderful staff and location. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable the hotel has got water stations to fill up your reusable bottles which is a lovely touch. Breakfast is good but could be better with not a lot of vegetarian options. One down side is that they let people put the towels on the pool chairs in the morning and reserve them all day so unless you’re down there early you probably won’t get a spot . Walking distance from the beach
"This hotel was a great price when booked online.  The pool, breakfast and beds were great. The bathroom doesn’t have a door, so be comfortable with the person you sure with!  This is the only hotel I’ve visited that requires a deposit for a room key and controls access to towels.  Easy access to restaurants, tourist shops, tours etc. the beach is about a 10 minute walk."
Will stay here again
Great facility great staff
"Hotel in good location, staff very friendly and welcoming.
Food and drink reasonable 
Some parts a bit dated and could do with new baby cots or At least deep cleaning. 
Decking outside near pool sketchy in parts our 2 year old stubbed her feet and grazed her knee could do with repair, image due to Covid.
Pool clean and good atmosphere
Breakfast had something for everyone with young children.
Would stay again 😊"
"Good value for price, decent breakfasts and great pool which is the centre piece of the hotel, rooms are getting tired and toilet cubicle is a very tight fit, pillows super uncomfortable, but otherwise a decent hotel. Location is one street back from beach, so a bit of a walk unless you find a shortcut through another hotel."
Nice place to stay
Great stay for second leg of our trip. Good breakfast and great pool. Only criticism would be that pool times should be later than 7pm. Would be great for a dip after a day out.
This is about our 5th stay here and reason we keep returning is because we love everything about the hotel ...my sister and I travel together twice a year ..
Great Swimming Pool
Great Swimming Pool
Breakfast its ok
"Spent two nights at this hotel on a recent trip to Sanur. Great location, big rooms (with a jacuzzi too) and nice pool area. Would definitely stay again."
"I recently stayed at this hotel. Check in was easy and fast. Hotel is big and a little dated. Deluxe jacuzzi room was large and comfortable bed. Bathroom was nice and modern only the water pressure in the shower was not good. The shower head needs to be replaced and the drain for the shower was blocked and very slow to drain. My room was close to the elevator and I could hear it constantly and also the soundproofing needs to be improved. The staff were friendly and warm. My only negative is that whilst laying at the pool on sunloungers the staff walk straight by me and could very well be asking if I needed drinks, or food, or lunch or any service. I was not once offered beverages, only offered by restaurant staff to buy the Christmas dinner. Staff should focus on upselling guests food and beverages and then this money could be used to renovate facilities. Buffet breakfast was great but a little boring after a week of the same food. The egg station needs to be moved into a shaded area in the morning it is blinding by light and sun. It's uncomfortable for guests to watch staff sweating over dryland and making food in the sun. It should be moved and staff should have fans , also more fans should be placed in the restaurant area for guests. For a 4 star hotel the service is good but I was not blown away. If I compare the same standard of hotel to one in Bangkok for example this hotel is lacking. Welcome drinks of iced tea is lame and should be handed to the guest in the lobby all day. Dinner vouchers for a meal should be given to guests for their stay. I paid almost $900 received average food, an old room, and the only special thing for me was the restaurant staff, the doormen and security , and the most amazing staff were the housekeepers. My room was serviced, spotless, and the housekeeping staff were outstanding . The staff at this hotel is what keeps people in the doors."
"overall good, recomended"
Good place to stay in the centre of the main street great pool large room with a balcony staff are lovely
I have stayed at this hotel several times and it is my first choice when going to Bali. Sanur is much far relaxed that other parts of the island with lots of great places to eat. The hotel breakfast is wonderful and sets you up for the day it covers all tastes and there is no limit on what you can eat. If you want eggs they fresh cooked for you and the bread is wonderful. For our last stay Agoda messed the booking up for all the people we were traveling with as the correct paperwork had not arrived  but the hotel staff resolved the matter. I will be going back to the hotel again and this should say it all
The hotel needs  a good work over after two years of Covid restrictions to get ready when Bali reopens. Spa bath had water supply problems and took forever to fill up.  The breakfast was great. Staff very friendly and helpful.
Great pool & temperature but they need to put sunbed cushions on all lounges as too hard and hot without. Breakfast good but a better variety of fruits and yoghurts would be nice as we stayed for 2 weeks and it was the same the whole time. They also run out of Green Tea for 4 days. Fresh milk in the fridge would of been appreciated. Overall good value for money and great location. Thank you Swiss Bel staff.
"Visited same hotel late 2019 and was happy to be back and met in same kind and welcoming way. 
Value for money in regards to both room and breakfast.
Recommend warmly this accomodation in Sanur Beach"
"Good sized rooms , 
Friendly staff.
Location was handy to everything"
"Central location, Pool is amazing and loved swimming there, breakfast was a lot of different choices and all delicious, staff very friendly and accommodating, they are currently updating a few rooms so there was some tradesman working during the day but didn't disturb our stay.
Will definitely stay here again"
Pleased with our stay comfortable rooms service very good breakfast each morning really nice would look to stay here again if we return.
"The hotel is good and clean, I like everything about this hotel except for the staff. I’ve waited more than half an hour waiting to be assigned to my room during my first check in. And the next two days, they did not clean up my room, saying because I didnot put the sign, while the day before I also didnot put the sign but they still clean up my room. I waited for two hours outside my room because it’s dirty and the staff is very slow to come to my room to clean it"
Most definitely a GREAT  hotel.
"We stayed a total of four nights.
The location was fantastic right near our favourite restaurant The Village. Close to the bakery, chemist and bottle shop.  
Loved the pools the large pool is 50 meters so enjoyed some lap swimming.
Our room was very spacious and we enjoyed the splash pool outside our room.  It’s called a pool access but you can’t swim to the main pool from your room. 
Throughly enjoyed our stay and will be back again. 
Thank you so much"
"Overall hotel facilities was fine, but I found security check when conduct car checking disturbing and make us not convenience, they ask whether we are guest or stay at the hotel, they ask what room number and they look us local/Indonesian more suspicious, that make us so inconvenience."
"Convenient location, can reach Sanur beach by walk, many cafes and boutique surround
Good breakfast with nice view of park and swimming pool
I impressed with all the staff, they are very helpful, and it really the best point of this hotel, please maintain
The only concern is room cleanliness due to many hotels in Bali have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, for cleaning they only do one per two days"
"Resort needs plenty of work on exterior black mould to buildings & pool walls . Rooms clean , staff very helpful. Lack of pool shade was poor . Moved rooms twice due to noise levels. Has potential but our stay was not relaxing."
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED RESORT
"It was a nice and pleasant stay, althought the food in only average, and the breakfast has limited choice"
"Centrally located in the heart of Sanur close to shops and restaurants.
A short walk to the beach.
Large pools and swim up bar.
Loved our stay will be back."
The room size is big but unfortunately the decoration wasn’t good. It little bit spooky when enter the room.
"Nice Swimming pool good for kids, 
warm staff, a bit small parking area, and need to improve on breakfast."
"Location is good, close to lots of eateries, water was way to cold for my liking, have travelled to Bali for 40 years and stayed at lots of different resorts but the pool was the coldest I have ever been in. Couldn't swim in it and I didn't like the pool sun lounges as the supply of them is very limited. You had to be out there very early to get one that wasn't in the water. If you did manage to get one in the water, you then had to be careful you didn't drop any of your belongings in the water. Bathroom is good and clean,"
Always a good place to stay the staff excellent
"Good Hotel with nice swimming pool, warm staff, need to improve on breakfast menu."
Good hotel northern end of Sanur
"WIFI is slow that unable me to work from hotel. Leaking toilet that cause small flush water. Room floor is sticky with dead insect. Breakfast buffe is tasteless and little option for 4 star hotel.
Hotel good point:
Outdoor swimming pool is amazing big olympic size with resort style. Hotel staffs are all friendly and helpfull"
"we stayed there for 1 week
Breakfast a bit disappointing more or less was the same food for a whole week. the area is nice it was not on the beachside but they have a  private beach that we can enjoy."
"Nice breakfast buffet... My room was town -side, not pool-side. Every morning, the “cock-a-doodle-doo” was natural morning alarm for me!"
"Rooms are good size but bathroom was small and doors were awkward. The pool area was big and had a smaller pool for kids however no play area as pictured. Gym was average. Buffet Breakfast was fantastic, had everything you could want. Location was central and about 5-10 min walk to the beach. Overall value for money was okay, would have expected more for the price."
Overall the location is good. The unpleasant part would be the toilet without door and there is wall mirror attached to the bed that can see through the toilet. The bathroom water pressure is low
I was put off by this at first because it was such a big hotel compared to all the little places in Sanur but with my little kids it was actually really good.
The Swiss-Bel was a nice place to stay with kids. We felt very comfortable and the kids had a lot of fun in the big pool area.
"We had a pool view room Daughter stayed in a pool access room that was smaller and more expensive 
Pool view was the better option"
"I have stayed this hotel for a couple of times. The hotel started to show wear and tear. The room is clean, but poolside area should be improved. The chairs look old, the towels are worn out, some areas are dirty. The staff was not very friendly, at least to me. Hope next time it will be better. Overall, still good as budget resort."
"Nice resort, friendly staff, beautiful pool and close to restaurants etc"
"We stayed for one night only. That was enough. The breakfast was delicious. However, the room is not so convenient for a family - a bathroom was not isolated and noises were easily heard. In general, we were satisfied with our staying."
Make sure stay on  in side hotel not on the outside lane beside hotel dogs barking 6.30am each morning.
"We stayed here for a total of 13 nights, so I would say our experience is pretty balanced. This hotel is just sad in my opinion, it has all the possibilities, just with no follow-through. The highlight of the hotel is the pool. AVOID the Jacuzzi rooms! They are small and filled with too much furniture to make it practical, the jacuzzi is just a disappointment.  Our jacuzzi drain didn't function properly, was dirty, and the faucet and drains are filled with green algae. They are the cheapest rooms, so it's expected they are not the nicest. When we walked into our room the first day, it seemed barely cleaned, floor was a dirty, bare minimum on towels and soap. Wife asked them to re-clean as we went to dinner, it helped! On night 3 or so our ac went out. Room wouldn't cool down. They moved us to a room that we stayed in for the remainder of our stay, a pool view room. No jacuzzi, but a nicer room with working ac, so we accepted. 
About a week before we arrived I had heard rumors online about construction work taking place, so I called the hotel directly to see if this was true. Unfortunately, the employee flat out lied and said no construction work was taking place, or would be taking place during our stay. The entire time we were there the pool bar was closed, and construction work was being done on the facilities around the pool. Was obviously not my favorite as it made ""relaxing by the pool"" almost unbearable. The paint on the building was also run-down and molding. Disappointing.  BUT, 2 things this hotel has going for itself, it's location, and it's pool. The pool has great possibilities with a tanning deck area great for little kids, and the location is close to many great restaurants. If they aren't within walking distance, you can catch a GoJek for real cheap. In short, I don't think we'll be returning or recommending this hotel in the future, but if major upgrades are made, who knows. Cheers."
They need to look into investing in new towels. I wash my car with a better rug then this
Good location and good pool. Rooms are large  but  very empty and that gives it a weird feel. bathroom needs a good clean. Would stay there again tho
"Maybe because I chose to buy discounted voucher, I got room with dust in the tea and coffee keeping box, pile of dust inside the side lamp boxes, tainted mirror in the bathroom and wardrobe, troubled card sensor in the power slip socket, creaky sounding wooden floor and several literally moving and I could lift it, but had a good sleep overnight regardless."
"I found this hotel to be quite run down and dirty, pool area was huge, heated and gets alot of sun which is nice."
"I found the room to have very poor lighting. It was not possible to read in bed at night. Bathroom smelt on many occassions of sewerage. Having toilet enclosed behind a glass panel made it too small  and for some reason the bed was on concrete and there was at least 6 inches of concrete jutting out on either side of bed which you had to be careful of when getting out at night.  It was difficult to find a clean table at breakfast, the plates were never cleared away or table wasn’t reset properly. We were told that they were short staffed but this was every day. Crockery was always in short supply for tea and coffee! 
Pool beds were difficult to get and not enough shaded areas were to be found. I know a lot of people like sunbathing in full sun but a lot don’t. Despite signs up saying you could not be away from chair more than an hr, many did leave towels on them and went off.
On the plus side the pool was lovely to use and the hotel was in a good position for lovely restaurants."
"Staying here over Christmas 2019 with the family and here's what it's like.
1. Check-in procedure: Room not ready by 2pm as promised, we had to come back at 3pm. No apologies received. Check in is also sooooo slow. When we finally got into the room, it was hot as hell, no air cond left on for the comfort of the arriving guest. Bad.
2. Staff: Most staff seem to not understand basic questions or requests from English speaking guests, which is most of the tourists here. They are also very pushy to try and book you in to hotel theme nights which are never busy because they cost soo much.
3. Breakfast: Large buffet, gets crazy busy, the egg guy is very very Slow, and they rarely put on more than 1 egg guy. Sometimes 9 or 10 standing in line. A good 20 min wait to order.
4. Pool: beautiful pool but is spoilt by the bogan aussies drinking all day and then being typically very loud. They have a pool towel card system which is shocking, basically you lose the card, no towel. 
No more room."
"The resort is old and rundown, breakfast ok. Pool very nice and warm. Location great to walk to shops etc."
"We were very impressed when we arrived. Gorgeous lobby and a nice looking pool access room. But.....that night we hardly got any sleep, there is a gap between the room door letting all the noise and light in. Could here people walking past all night, the hallways echoed, the walls were paper thin, could even hear the neighbours doing the dirty if you get my drift!
Also, the ‘welcome drink’ we were expecting a cocktail or Bintang as it was to be collected at the pool bar, but it was just watery cordial! 
In the bathroom, the shower water went straight into the toilet cubicle, not very safe as it created very slippery tiles.
There were stains on the sheets and on our 3rd night we woke up at 3am to what sounded like a jet engine in our room. Who knows what it was, but we got moved to another room till it was fixed. Not even an apology or free cocktail or drink the next day. Very disappointing. Would never stay here again!"
"v slow check in, arrived at Hotel 4-5 pm!! Hotel good value for money! V quiet, due to Covid, Nice Room, but some of the lights not working in room, indicating insufficient hotel maintenance!!  Friendly Staff, would stay here again!"
"Stayed here for 7 nights in January and booked 3 x Grand Deluxe Jacuzzi rooms for my family and I. When we checked in only 1 x Jacuzzi room was allocated to us and 2 x pool view without advice as to why only 1 room type we had actually booked was given. When we enquired about this at the reception we were given several different excuses and then different ways to resolve our issue from each person we spoke too.
When at the pool bar our bills were mixed up  and there was so much confusion I never felt I could trust the staff again so opted to pay cash for the rest of the trip. At Breakfast we were told we had to pay for our child’s breakfast (even though it was already included) and when the lady went to call reception to confirm another lady who said she knew what was going on then handed me a bill to pay for the breakfast. Overall poor communication from/between staff and a poor customer experience. Only positive for this Hotel was the pool."
"They don't supply drinking water in the rooms, I had to purchase for $5"
"The bed room was not cleaned until after 5.00pm, we had to ask for clean towels, toilet paper, every day. The room was very dated. Could not get a lounge bed near pool, could only get one if your put your towel on the bed before 7.00am.  The best thing was the breakfast. Would not stay there again."
"Great clean bed, quiet at top pool in the morning. 
Horrible room with peeling wallpaper, cracked walls & massive gaps in wooden floor full of dirt. 
Too many people drinking beer in the pool for hours on end. Not our idea of a holiday. Breakfast restaurant feels like a busy food court."
The breakfast not vegan fiendly
Don’t stay here! It is a very run down hotel in desperate need of maintenance. Staff are lovely but the hotel is old and dirty
I will never stay
The breakfast is no good. Staff is ok helpful. This place not convenient to go out for food and shop.
"We have stayed in many properties in Sanur over the past several years. Of the modestly-priced properties, the Swiss-Belresort Watu Jimbar is certainly our favorite. The room was clean and well-furnished. The breakfast was good with significant variety. The pool was amazing! And the staff was very professional. We loved it as the home base for bringing some friends to Bali for the first time."
"We always choose to stay at Swiss-Belresort Watu Jimbar everytime when we come to Sanur. We stay here 3 times a year as it has everything we need,  as its our home away from home. Highly recommend this hotel as you won't be disappointed."
My stay in teh Swiss-Belresort Watu Jimbar was awesome. Standard Jaccuzi in the room and everthing was clean. I liked the roomview and the staff was really nice and well organized. I will come back next year.
"afetr having travelled to some of the biggest cities in the world i have realized that my heart lies in asia. being in bali and so close to nature, coupled with the friendly and attentive staff made my stay one of the most memorable in my life. i truly believe that indonesian people are the most humble of beings and being around them made me feel closer to humanity than i feel in paris, new york or shanghai. 

thank you swiss-belresiort watu jimbar for making my stay a truly memorable one."
"We booked the Swiss-Belresort Watu Jimbar as a couple for 6 nights. The hotel is in one word: superb! Very nice facilities (including a very big pool), Excellent staff and great food!"
"Had a lovely stay at the swiss belresort watu jimbar Sanur. Great staff and facilities. Location is excellent as is the breakfast.  The resort could do with a little more maintenance, nothing major"
It was our first time staying with Weiss-Belresort Watu Jimbar.  The landscape is quite interesting featuring swim pool all the way around the property.  Staffs are friendly.  Bed is very comfortable.
"Location: The resort is well located in Sanur with some fine restaurants, general stores and shops across the street and within 5 -10 mins walk in either direction.  The area is safe for tourists.
Service: The Hotel can be proud of their staff.  We have stayed in many hotels in Bali and the service and hospitality at Swiss Bel Sanur are without doubt the best we have experienced.  The staff were wonderful and welcoming and so friendly!  The food and dining was one of the best in Bali.    
Room: The room is a good size with shower/toilet/bath. The plunge pool was the hero piece for us.  The bar fridge is on the small size.  
Housekeeping: The room was cleaned daily, generally in the afternoon.  The young lad who cleaned our room was very polite and friendly and always addressed us by our names which was something we have rarely experienced.  If he was late coming to clean our room he was very apologetic.  We recognised that he was quite busy and at times overlooked some minor details that might otherwise irk other guests; eg: not restocking of soap, toilet/tissue paper and not replacing dirty glasses/cups with clean ones. If we requested for these to be replaced, he was happy to comply."
"Really enjoyed our stay at the Swiss-Belresort. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It is located on the main street in Sanur close to the beach and Hardy's. We upgraded our room to a plunge pool while there for a small fee and it was amazing. Will definitely return.
Thanks for a wonderful stay."
"We are happy to stay at the Swiss-belresort Grand Jacuzzi room for 2 nights, but It is so weird that the Jacuzzi is not inside the room, it is on the balcony facing outside not even facing the pool.  The light in the balcony is auto light, and the light will automatically turn off at 10pm overnight. Yet, it is not a big issued, we enjoyed the room with Jacuzzi a lots.  Sanur is much quiet than Kuta, we enjoyed the peace staying in Sanur. 
There are lots of restaurants just right outside the hotel, a coco mart just 5 minis walk, and lots of small shops closed by."
