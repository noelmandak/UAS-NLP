"Bintang Bungalow is one of the best villa ive ever stay, the location, price and amenities is the best, Food was superb! And the most important is the staff was very friendly and amazing, they even help my wife to buy some medicine and did not charge for it even we insisted to pay, Thank You Bintang Bungalow, I’ll be back for sure and i will stay even longer next time."
"We had an incredible stay at Bintang Bungalow. The staff were incredibly responsive, helpful and genuinely kind throughout our stay. The rooms and grounds are attractive and well maintained. They offer a free shuttle to the beach and rides to the port for an additional fee. We look forward to another visit here the next time we are in Nusa Penida."
"On Nusa Penida there are no mega resorts or anything like that so this place seemed to be as fancy as it gets and it was an incredible experience for us. Perfect blend of modern facilities but still humble and middle of the forest living. Location was great, very close to the popular crystal bay and a short moped ride away from every other major attraction we wanted to see while in penida. Highly recommend the nearby Amok Sunset Bar/Restaurant for dinner, drinks and an amazing sunset.
P.S. the bathroom in our room was so cool I want to redo my bathroom at home the same way now!"
"We absolutely loved this beautiful bungalow! The staff are all so kind and welcoming, the pool is awesome, the breakfast is delicious and the rooms are clean, spacious and one of the best we’ve had on our whole trip. They even offer a free pickup from the harbour for the first use of the hotel car. Can not recommend this place enough :)"
We had such a lovely time here. Very good value for money. So beautiful. The staff are amazing and so helpful. The breakfast is great and the rooms are so spacious and pretty. Thanks team.
"We really enjoyed our stay here! Spacious bungalow, nice long infinity pool, great cuisine and finally the staff were very helpful in answering our questions and making our stay enjoyable. Super wifi connection (in case you wish to work remote from
There). Thank you, we will come again!"
"We had the best time at Bintang Bungalow. The place is beautiful and right in the middle of the forest with palm trees and all around.  The hosts were super nice and helpful, they organised scooters and transport for us. WiFi is a bit unstable at times, but that's no big deal."
"Lovely place, very friendly and helpfull staff, place was easy to find. The place is clean n tidy,. No TV..but who needs TV these day while wifi is 24 hours n free.."
"They really cared for us and we felt super good there ! The owners are really kind and really want us to pass the best moment! On top of that the location is ideal and facilities are Amazon, our room was super nice especially the outdoor bathroom"
Very good for the price and friendly staff. Great spot to stay in Penida. You are in the middle of a jungle so bring earplugs
"Great location and beautiful bungalow.
The only problem I encountered was, the roof can be leaking if raining. 
And the water tap obviously fresh from the sea. 😂 salty as your vitamin Sea.
But overall our stay was worth the money."
Really wonderful environment and excellent service.  Sincerely recommend.
We loved this hotel and the service of staff.  My kids were happy tobe at resort and free ride to Crystal bay beach is icing on top
"I spend a night in here and it was cool! They have quite a big pool and have a cozy bathroom. Unfortunately, I can not turn on the tv since the cable and the plug are not close enough but that's fine. The wifi also good, and they have two menus for breakfast which is fried rice and pancakes"
No words to explain the experience
"Staff were fantastic.  Our plans changed and they allowed us change our dates and we ended up staying an extra day.  All the staff were great, so friendly and eager to help.  I booked a pedicure and massage at a salon 10mins bike ride, Maddie was kind enough to drop me off and also offered to pick me up but wasn't needed as the husband of the salon owner ended up dropping me back.  People here are just so kind and generous.  We loved our stay in Nusa Penida.  Highly recommend Bintang Penida."
"We had a good time with Bintang Bungalow.
Thank you so much."
"Amazing place,amazing staff!!
Greetings to the owner from Bulgaria.He did his job perfectly!"
"nice and friendly staffs, clean and comfortable room and facility, nice food and great pool. highly recommend if you do."
"the staff is very welcoming..give watermelon juice upon arrival.
the design of the villa is very nice with pool.tq"
Clean good kind bfast good facility good just bit far from.restaurant becouse restaurant araount alot close cos of covid but employe help to order food also and delivery so far so good
"Not cramped and well designed, great atmosphere there, will be coming back!"
"Three of us stayed at Bintang for one night during our end-year trip to Nusa Penida. The place is nice; I liked the environment. The big bed was clean and comfy, however, the smaller bed at the attic is quite dusty. The pool is nice and surrounding garden is well-maintained. Since  we're there for a very short trip, we only after Kelingking, Broken, Angel's Billabong, Atuh and Diamond beaches, and turns out the location of the hotel is not perfectly matched our itinerary - it's rather far from those beaches and not located at between the ways . But it's our fault anyway, if we're after the beaches nearby the hotel, it shouldn't be a matter. The staffs are nice and kind. We check out early in the morning and they packed up our breakfast before seven. It's an incident that we found no water runs at 3 am. In the morning, when we told the staff; he said there's probably pipe leakage and off to fix it right away."
Living close to nature. Likes it.
Nice place a bit isolated but nice pool to chill at.  Need to have transport or book from hotel
"really cute dogs but sad to see them spend most of the time in a cage. Room was great but a bit overpriced. Pool needed filter change and restaurant not very nice but otherwise a decent resort, easy to meet people."
"We stay here only one nite, good food, surrouding is beautiful with pool and garden. Staffs are very helpful., near crystal beach, good location, easy to access. Will come back again!"
If you are looking for a calm and quiet place then it's a best option.Friendly staff.Its location is near to crystal bay beach.
"If you are afraid of small insect, this place is your night mare"
"Stayed here with my best friend for a weekend getaway. Didn't realise how good the hotel is until we got there. Even before we checked in, every time people asked where we're staying and we said Bintang Bungalow, the word ""wow"" will always came out.
I guess it's fair to say, for an island like Nusa Penida where there are not much options for accommodations, this one can be categorised as luxury. Especially for the islands' residents.
Located slightly out of main road, but not far from Crystal Bay. The swimming pool is nice for a chill out session with sun beds and pool towels provided, but not for serious swimming due to size.
The breakfast is ok. We can also order food from the kitchen almost anytime we want with reasonable price.
Experienced black out for about 30-40 minutes but it's because there was work in progress with the islands' main power supply.
Overall, it was a good experience. If you want a bit of luxury in Nusa Penida, you can consider Bintang Bungalow."
"There were 4 of us just looking for a fun, relaxing adventurous 3 days on Nusa Penida and the Bintang Bungalow's were perfect! We got the family bungalow and everything was fine, just one thing is that the aircon does not cool down the loft where the second bed is so whomever sleeps up in the loft will roast. We just brought the mattress down from the loft and put in on the floor and it worked out fine. 
The facilities are great. Laying out by the pool after a day adventuring the island was so relaxing! The food so-so but all you need is a couple Bintang's and Bintang Radler's and you will be set!
The staff goes above and beyond and they were all so great. One of our group had a bad fall on the motorbike and one of the staff drove her on the back of his bike to Volcome Beach and hung out with us while we enjoyed the beach! 
We would definitely recommend staying at Bintang Bungalow!"
"I had stayed at the Bintang Bungalow for 2 nights and I was overwhelmed by the most warm-hearted and courteous staff there. They offer free pick-up from the dock which could easily cost you 10k Ruphia if you hire a driver from the harbour on the spot. They provide homemade food in the cafeteria, and their kitchen is clean. The room (bungalow) is comfy and clean as well. If anything, the wifi connection was not that good, probably because the telecommunication infrastructure on Nusa Penida island is not up to the standard yet. Be mindful when you wander around in the garden, as the coconut from the coconut tree may hit you in the head."
"Staff was extremely helpful. They booked our speedboat ticket to Nusa Penida and arranged for a driver to pick us up and take us directly to resort.
Properly ground is beautiful. Restaurant food was very delicious, we had seven plus meals and every time was yummy!
We were able to check in early and rented scooter right away. 
Staff booked our speedboat back to Sanur and we paid for driver to take us to the dock. 
Overall our stay was very enjoyable, we would love to come visit here again.
Thank you for your excellent service:)"
"Located not far from Nusa Penida harbour. Nice staff to answer all ur question and helpful in planning your day tour. Near crystal bay , beautiful sunset!  However, at night some birds make sound at the roof top will wake you up ....that so call feel the nature"
"really recommended for couples....such a romantic places, nice places to stayed, near Crystal Bay beach and all the staffs were very friendly especially Mba Komang who was really helpful for anything we need. Will stay there again if I visit Nusa Penida Island. Thanks"
"This place is beautiful. The host and staff are  super nice, highly recommend to stay here if  you visit Nusa Penida"
"+ Beautiful and clean bungalow with cool open bathroom, good food, great location for a scooter roadtrip to east and west side, near Crystal Bay
Perfect for a short stay at Nusa Penida :)"
"i'm pretty surprised with their property.
this bungalow is extremely nice and good. at 1st i was thinking the location was very far-far away from the crowds and downtown. but eventually after i explore this island, their location is very strategic if you looking for Beaches site and waterfall site.
1 night was very short for me so i definitely will be coming back in nearest future.
the food is very good specially their spring roll.
(-)
*there's no mineral water provided.
 if i may suggest to management you may provide the mineral water since       the cost is not that much.
* No Television
   i know this island to big to be explore even in 1 day is not enough. but for  sure sometimes tv is good thing to kill the time while we were only chilling on the bed.
overall i'm pretty satisfied with this bungalow !!
irene"
"Overall stay was good. We had our breakfast, lunch & dinner at Bintang Bungalow at reasonable price. Wifi was so-so but accepted."
"We can fully recommend Bintang bungalow: very friendly staff, good bungalows, clean and a nice pool."
"The location is near crystal bay beach where you can do snorkeling. The bungalow was super clean and it has unique bathroom. I also got a pool view room, suggest by the nice staff and it was really worth the price."
"The hotel property is very nice but not maintained enough. Our room/bungalow was ok but smelt a little strange. The staff was friendly but not professional and seemed amorphous. The included breakfast was spare. Nevertheless, Nusa Penida is a wonderful island to explore by hotel provided scooters and the price is ok."
"The bungalow we stayed at is spacious, however, please consider that the bathroom is an open shower and there are plenty of mosquitoes at the area esp at night. We sprayed an insect repelant and was shocked as to numbers of mosquitoes fell.  The upper bed needs more lighting, power outlets and mosquito net. The staffs are ok, but not that courteous. They need more training as to customer interaction.  Breakfast option is ok. The restaurant menu, price and the food are ok. The whole place however is beautiful. The pool looks great. Sadly we didn't  have time to enjoy it as we just stay overnight. This place is just 5 min away from cystal bay."
"there was no fridge and no hot water in this bungalow. no TV also, there are insects and at night you can hear the creatures calling , chicken and strange creatures. there was a cockroach. remember this is on the island. expected
rental of bike was reasonable and good."
"This place is very dreamy. I loved the pool, the bungalow itself and the bathroom that did not have a roof. The food is really good. They even allowed us to eat and drink by the pool ."
"Excellent stay here! Beautiful air conditioned bungalows! Great staff! The food is just ok but it really doesn't matter, the place is just lovely! Highly recommend!!"
"Stayed here September of 2019, staff was great. Bungalow was great. Looked like the one we stayed in had recently been renovated (at least the outdoor bathroom anyway) Overall a solid experience my only gripe is that the walls of the Bungalows are paper thin therefor you could hear people in other Bungalows when they were speaking loudly or playing music. We had a group of 4 staying next to us and they were blasting music for much of the evening and we were trying to go to sleep. I finally had to yell “SHUT UP!” And they seemed to quiet down... mind you this was up until almost 11 too so it’s not like it was that early by any means. Water pressure was also an issue, had a couple tough showers where the water basically shut completely off. Overall it was a good option as it was close to Crystal Beach. Not much else near the Bungalow though so expect some chill evening by the pool or in your Bungalow. Breakfast was good, staff was fantastic!"
"Very nice bungalow which near to Crystal Bay Beach. Location took about 20 mins from port. 
Overall was very good, staff also very nice. Just the food maybe need some more improvement."
"Staff are so helpful, the bungalow is so nice and kept very clean. Would definitely recommend to anyone thinking about staying here"
Nice bungalow little bit far. Good pool and service.
The best location you would ever find and the staff too were just wonderful and accommodative. Thank you for a memorable anniversary that you gave us team.
"This is an awesome location.  Quiet and away from the crowds.  Scooter for day adventures and then swing down to Crystal bay for a swim, only a 5 minute drive back after that.   Pool is amazing.  Out door showers are mint.  Make sure to try the home made spring rolls.  Best I’ve tasted in Indonesia."
"Lovely place and very friendly staff, especially Epi who greeted us. She is a very nice and always smiling person who helps if you would need anything. Great place to chill, away from hustle and bustle. Very clean, nice pool. Local restaurant serves nice, tasty food. This is heaven on the earth. We’re going to get back there some day and stay much longer. Many thanks Epi for your hospitality!"
We were very happy with all the hospitality and beautiful surroundings at this small hotel on Nusa Penida. Fantastic stay and would happily return.
"Great staff, very helpful, good food, and nice location."
"Located near crystal bay , my favorite beach in Nusa Penida for snorkeling and best beach to access. Also close to Amok sunset restaurant for best sundowners. Value for money, clean, nice pool and friendly staff."
"It's very far away from harbour and it's very inside ..it's near crystal beach the location good but room is okay the washroom didn't had a tap it just had a shower proper maintaince is required their were ants in the washroom.
Average place to stay"
Great pool and room. Nice outdoor bathroom and very relaxing. Have to say however the food was not great at all. It's about a 15 to 20 minute drive from the port.
"Swimmingpool and a good restaurant! Nice bathroom and we sleep very well the bed is laying more then fine. Only is the location far from a lot, the closest is crystal beach, but you will need a scooter on the island even if you wanna go to the beach, because to roads are bad! You can book excursions the snorkeling i will do definitely if you like seeing fish and swimming! They can also book for you the boat ticket and give you a transfer to the boat or pick you up from the harbour."
Love how this place has a value for money in house restaurant and is close to crystal bay. We booked a 4pax room which has a mezzanine floor on top with a double bed mattress. The toilet is amazing! We get to shower in under the moonlight and admire the stars.
"I stayed 2 nights here by rent a scooter from the port. it's about 15 mins ride to the resort. Welcome drink a fresh watermelon juice. The villa is nice , clean and bed is comfortable. Pool is fine.
I have dinner at the resort for both days, the ""Balinese Chicken"" is nice as well as "" chickens satay"" are serves with rice.
Location : I think is good for me to explore west side and east side of the island by scooter."
Staff quickly greeted us when we arrived and served us some watermelon juice. Nice and clean. The pool was perfect for cooling down.  Food was decent.
"We was there for 7 days and the stay was beautiful. Nice staff, good breakfast....."
"The place was amazing .. Hidden, but the wifi. It was not pleasant. I did not have any access to the internet and you know the thrill."
"No TV, Internet very slow, no fridge, no bath.. electricity black out at arround 3am.  Water for shower not strong enough. Got ant and flies at night. Never come back."
The in-house nasi goreng with chicken satay and pancakes were super yumm!
"Prima service, vriendelijk personeel"
The staff was so nice and very helpful! The rooms were so nice. The pool was awesome. I would recommend (:
"Staff provide good service, clean hotel. But rarely have facilities, if sleeping 4 people, the room is narrow."
Rooms are beautiful and clean. Staff are always ready to assist you. And the free shuttle service to and fro Crystal Bay was a lifesaver. Would def come again.
"Gorgeous place, set back away from the road. 
Feels like jungle paradise....very friendly staff, great food, lovely rooms with good amount of privacy. Loved the outdoor shower. 
Only thing I would say is take some earplugs as the cockerels wake up early😉"
"We spent one night on the island, the bungalows were perfect for our needs. Minimal but lovely setting and good staff. The breakfast wasn't great but fine. Staff very friendly, they helped plan our two days and organised drivers."
Had a pleasent stay in bunglow staff were very freindly and helpful  location wise its around 15 min frm harbour and good food
"They couldn't care less. First left us stranded at the harbour after mailing us and telling they'll offer a free ride to hotel. Did not. when we got to the hotel, said they didn't send one on purpose cos one of their guests left them waiting for one hour at the harbour the other day. We ignored it and still was determined to make the best outta our time there. Next, they gave us the ""Deluxe or special room"" which smelled of a strong wood all day. Water pressure was non existent. Lights bulbs were out. Still all manageable considering its $50. 
But the real problem was the staff, they were constantly talking to each other in Balinese and joking or remarking about the guests (ourselves included) and they were doing so while serving food, or right to our faces with a smile on. It was a horrible experience. 
There would be a ton of better places on the island for $50. so avoid this place. Specially if you're a couple who wants a hassle/worry free stay. Just an awful place and vibe"
"We stayed at family room and it was nice. Nice bed at the 1st floor and 2nd Floor. The bathroom is half outdoor and it is still clean. Not so big swimming pool. We went to the restaurant and we found that sometimes there is no consistensy with the food. 1st morning i got poach eggs with bread, but the next morning, just poach eggs without bread. That happen with the caesar salad too at night. I will not recommend to buy food in there if you rent a car or bike. Better to go out and find another restaurant. Overall i give them 6.5/10 for 2 nights in penida."
"We loved the place. It's beautiful, unique and clean! :) The staffs are not just very friendly compared to staffs in Bali."
"Very friendly staff, the place is cozy and unique overall thanks to great moments"
"Pros: beautiful, relaxing, very nice staff, clean, great pool, close to beach. Cons: none! 
Highly recommend. We will be back! Thank you!"
"The hotel is very beautiful, the only negative thing is the road to the hotel"
Breakfast was not much
"The property is tucked away by crystal bay so a short drive into the nearest town and a fair walk to restaurants etc. The on site restaurant is limited and room facilities very basic. There's no fridge in the room and the room doesn't get made up during your stay. This may be because we weren't actually in a bungalow which was unexpected as we had booked one we were in a different building which was slightly disappointing as it had no natural light. 
Pool was nice. 
Staff are friendly and helpful.
Overall nice place to stay."
"Cons: 
no drinking water provided
no dustbin
electricity outage couple of time (thought it came back quickly, may be via generator)
Pros:
Good location, nearby crystal bay
Staff helpful in shuttle to Crystal bay beach"
We really enjoyed our stay.
"The pool was the only plus point. Staff was inefficient in changing the towels on the pool chairs, we had to ask for clean towels ourselves. And no adapters in the whole place, even the only usb charger they have at the counter was spoilt. Staff was also not very helpful in helping to source for alternatives, so my phone was basically dead for the whole time I was there. They did offer me a bike ride to the nearby store to get toothbrush, because they don’t provide that at the hotel too. Location was quite deserted, not near any jetty. The nearest eating place (other than the hotel itself) was a five to ten min walk, and the shop was not even open the full two days we were there. The next nearest eating place was a twenty min walk out. It gets super dark at night that we had to walk with my friend’s phone torchlight since not much street lights around. Could have chosen a more expensive but more central or a more convenient location."
"Well, we suppose to live there 4 days, but in a 2 days we left this hotel, because of many reasons. Location is not good, no shops near, no cafes, you can stay only in the hotel. Food is simple, breakfast is so so, you need to pay additional money to get more choice. Staff was very unpolite, not smiling. The worst thing that we bought a tour from the hotel, waited car for long, but when we arrived to the place, they took us to wrong tour, which we visited before. Not advice this hotel to anyone."
"Hotel bersih, breakfast enak, dinner proper dan enak, kolam renang bersih. Sayang lokasi cukup terpencil. Tp tidak khawatir krn hotel cukup menyediakan fasilitas restoran dan kolam renang yg ok. Kamar dan kamar mandi nya bagus. Wifi ada tapi putus2."
"the Villas, including outdoor bathroom, were super clean and really nice. It is a quiet and relaxing place to stay with a nice Pool and very friendly staff. Would definitely recommend this place."
"Staff were not very helpful and there was always lots of confusion
Food in restaurant was not very nice
Rooms smelt really yucky
Rooms were clean enough but mosquito nets dirty
Air con in rooms was great
Pool was great"
The staff here is very courteous and the location is just a kilometre from the Crystal Bay beach.
Place was close to Crystal bay .staff was really helpful ..anything's I asked they give me right answer also great facility. Everything was beautiful and handy .reception girl and boy was very helpful. Feel very bad for sort stay  also they have free transport for Crystal bay .I must say whatever I needed they arrange for me
Love everywhere within Bintang
"We stayed here for five nights and it was an absolute pleasure. Clean, beautiful outdoor shower with hot water, complimentary breakfast, very helpful and pleasant staff. Great value for your money. Would definitely stay here again!"
"we've paid 29€ which is good value regarding the size of room, it's clean, new and in good condition. Just the internet bad and breakfast that can be improved"
The hotel located close to crystal bay but far from harbor. Hotel has pick up and drop off service 100K/way. We rent motorbike from hotel at 70K/day to roam around the island. Staff were somehow friendly. Don't expect anything much with this price.
"Well worth the AU$50 a night. The room was large, comfortable and the pool an dining are made it truly feel like a resort, which was a definite welcome after surviving the day exploring the island. The island is beautiful, but a lot of it is not kept well maintained and the weather can be VERY hot and unforgiving!"
Its was a good hotel with a pool and strategic place near the crystal bay beach
"I loved the place, nice huts, great location and great pool. But there are things that can definitely be improved. There was construction and noise every morning  from 8 am, the breakfast was very like the same everyday and not too many options. Also we got no clear explenation of what we could expect during our stay. We have loved the place but these hospitality things should really be upgraded to make it a perfect stay."
Friendly staff and nice place
"The place itself is very beautiful. The room is wonderful with comfy bed. They also have a jar that you can refill water in the kitchen, which is very good. Morover, I really love their outdoor bathroom. Their breakfast is okay. The staffs here is okay. They don't smile while talking to guests, but they are helpful."
"I love the atmosphere but for location is far away from city..
For breakfast, cleanliness & facilities are good."
He didn't talk me about price transport before I thing is free and am pay 150.000 rupiah
1.the staff a very friendly 2. Breakfast just so so  3. the lamps are quite dark so hard for packing things 4. the floor is dusty need to client with properly way(vacuum)
"The room and bathroom were clean, the tables in the restaurant weren't, so there were a lot of flies. The doors of the room didn't close well, so I had a very hard time locking and unlocking the doors. One of the doors of the closet closed too well (could hardly open it). And all this is not a huge problem if, when mentioned to the staff, someone comes and fixes it, but that wasn't the case. The staff obviously needs more training. My friend was speaking Indonesian almost fluently and when she tried to negotiate the very steep price they asked for a boat trip, the answers/reasons given were strange and then one of the girls turned around and said to her colleague 'that fat lady is an avaricious one'.  I"
"Great hotel with nice pool,tranquility n secluded,very relaxing...friendly stuff...will come back again...awesome"
"Booked a family room for a group of 5 people, an extra bed cost 100,000IDR per night and we had a very comfortable stay. Air conditioning was great and we loved the semi-outdoor showers. This place is fairly near to Crystal Bay which has great snorkeling, but best to rent a scooter so you can get easily to the rest of the island."
"The hotel was so nice, until we heard the sound of gecko so close to us. later we found out that the gecko was inside the room, it was scary and disgusting."
"great location very near to Crystal Bay, friendly staff, super clean room, delish food"
could be better priced. facilities are new and clean. best for the island.
Recommended
Rooms are very very clean and neat. I loved the outdoor showers! Staff provided superb services when you require assistance. Very personalised services catered to our needs. Staff were also very meticulous and helped in nearly every way possible. The most value for money resort ever :)
"Clean new hotel, friendly staff just need some improvement on the room details"
"Joli endroit bien entretenu 
Point négatif : bungalow très mal insonorisé 
Sinon très bien
Si petit déjeuner est compris ds votre réservation c’est un peu léger mais les suppléments sont très bon marché…
Donc bon rapport qualité /prix"
"Idéal pour passer quelques jours, rapport qualité prix imbattable. La wifi ne marche pas très bien jusqu’au bungalow c’est dommage :("
"Le cadre, les bugalows, la gentillesse du personnel, et les nombreux services proposés à partir de l'hotel font de ce logement une petite pépite et un des meilleurs qualité prix de notre voyage à Bali."
Ben hôtel..  très proche de cristal Bay..  5min en scooter.. belle piscine.. et beaux bungalows.. petit déjeuner pauvre..
"L'hotel est loin de tout ! 
La piscine est sympa et les massages proposés sont TOPS ! 
Par contre les bungalows sont sommaires et la salle de bain ainsi que les toilettes sont extérieurs .. c'est beau mais il faut aimer ... surtout en pleine nuit ! 
On avait des araignées ( et pas petites ) dans la chambre ainsi que d'autre insectes en tout genre .. il y a des jours au niveau des baies vitrées donc qui veut rentre :-) 
L'hotel est totalement perdu en foret , impossible de se déplacer autour à pieds pour aller manger ou se balader dans un village .."
"Notre sejour a été affreux! A notre arrivée la chambre n'est prête, ce qui oeut arriver. Mais la maniere de gérer ve contretemps fut abominable : on nous assoit sur des chaises et on nous demande d'attendre sans nous dire quoi ni combien de temps (il y en a eu pour 2h). Une fois ce delais'passer le scooter qu'on nous propose n'a ni retroviseurs ni casque. Ensuite on reserve la sortie snorkling pour les Mantas (la raison de la venue de tous les visiteurs). On nous donne rdv le matin a 8h. On se leve donc tôt pour finalement attendre a nouveau et finalelent etre informés que la sortie est repoussée à 10h30. On se présente à nouveau á la reception á l'heure et là en guise de bouquet final on nous laisse attendre a nouveau 1h30 sur des chaises pour finalement annuler la sortie. Nous sommes repartis de cet hotel apres y avoir attendu sur des chaises en bois inconfortables et n'avoir pu profiter d'aucun des atouts de cette ile. Nous deconseillons cet hotel a tous les voyageurs desireux d'etre traités avec égards. Sans compter le double paiement du pick up, merci l'arnaque!"
"on a adoré. piscine très agréable , personnels sympathique et bungalow propre."
"Personal super zuvorkommend un freundlich. erreichbar nur mit Roller oder Auto, Zimmer gross, jedoch war das Wasser kabutt und wir mussten erst Stunden warten"
"Pool ist super, Personal stets freundlich und bemüht. 
Leider ist es um die Sauberkeit  nicht allzu hoch bestellt, zudem ist es trotz der Abgeschiedenheit recht laut. 
Frühstück, welches inbegriffen ist, nicht zu empfehlen, Restaurant aber gut. Mietbare Roller sind qualitativ nicht gut, daher aufpassen bei längeren Strecken.
Für diesen Preis gibt es bessere Unterkünfte auf der Insel."
