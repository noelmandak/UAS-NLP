"Easily one of the most accommodating, genuinely friendly staff I've experienced. Ended up extending my stay multiple times because it was such a good fit. Location is close to multiple beaches, stores and restaurants. Daily thorough cleaning and quality options for food in the cafe/restaurant.
Only downside was they were finishing construction on a new spa but when I mentioned the noise, they moved me to a more distant room where it was much quieter."
"We loved staying at Naturela, it's very close to Warung Local and other great restaurants. The staff was very helpful and the room was clean! Would recommend for budget travellers wanting to treat themselves"
"Friendly staffs, spacious room and great location."
"Very nice hotel, good food, nice people there"
"We stayed in the Naturela bungalow for three nights and loved our stay there! The bathroom was large and the bedroom was bright and open! Cleaned daily and the staff were fantastic and super accommodating! It’s about a 30 minute walk to bingin beach or a 20 minute walk to Padang Padang. The restaurant area at the front of the restaurant was typically pretty busy and was a lot of fun to hangout and meet new people while enjoying a couple of cheap bintangs. There were lots of restaurants nearby, would definitely recommend staying in the bungalow if possible!"
"We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend naturela.
Why it’s nice:
- the food in the Café is very good, affordable and „safe“, they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
- The Café area and the pool area looks very beautiful and has a nice atmosphere- you can see the love that the owners put into it
- The staff of the cafe and hotel were really nice.
- We were able to rent a scooter for 80k per day.
- The location is very good: there are many cool restaurants around, many beaches to explore with a scooter, a nice mix between backpacker/surfing-gentrified and traditional warungs.
- The AC worked well and automatically turned on and off depending on the set temperature (when in the room, power is enable by the key card).
What might be nice to know:
- the wifi in our room was patchy, in the cafe /downstairs it worked well
- It’s Bali- the doors and windows don’t seal, and the walls show the impact of the high humidity (also the window in the bathroom always allows for air to come in)
- The bathroom showed some rust on the sink, the water pressure is low for warm water and higher for cold water, as in many Balinese bathroom the entire room is a „wet room“ and something is always leaking, in this case we suspect the sink 
- there is only one towel per person
- There aren’t a lot of opportunities to hang towels, garments or toiletry bags etc.
- We were really glad that we booked a room with a balcony"
"We took the bangalow, was a big room, nice bed. All really clean and new. Location is good but you need moto of course (really close do padang, close to uluwatu 10min and halfway from balangan ). Breakfast is cheap and good. The only cons: some a/c are noisy from a neighbour apartment, and they dont like do register your consume and ask you to pay straight everything you buy (like an water)"
"I stayed in a bungalow and was very nice. However, people staying in the basic rooms were not so happy."
"We have nothing to complain about ""Naturela Hostel"". 
The rooms are cozy, especially the one on the second level. The bathroom was ok. Well located for restaurants, friendly staff. You'll need a motorbike to commute around the island, but this applies to everyone who likes to explore it anyway. 
We'd recommend and stay there again."
"I stayed here for a couple of days and I've enjoyed my stay. The room was small but adjustable.  
This hotel has a restaurant and they server amazing food.
The staff is courteous and will go above and beyond to assist you. 
I would like to share my incident to show why one should book this place. 
I had early morning ferry from Sanur harbour to Nusa Lembongan and I was running late as local cab driver were not available for the ride. I reached out to the property owner and she just grabbed her keys and drove me to the harbour.  Her prompt response to assist me saved my trip. 
It may be a little far from the heart of Uluwatu but if you're looking for comfortable stay you can book this place. Enjoy the pool and have amazing food at the restaurant."
"Very good location, near bingin beach and many restaurants. The hotel is ok, the family room is good and confortable, perfect if you are traveling with kids. The staff is so kind, the are very aware to help you. The hotel had a restaurant. The only bad think was that the bathroom had a very bad smell."
"At under rs.300k the rooms were very good value. Bed was comfortable, bathroom good, a/c could be more powerful but works, lovely pool and the restaurant is excellent. Friends initially stayed in a twin room - I do not recommend this (stick to the doubles). The bungalows/deluxe rooms looked super nice. Staff were absolutely lovely.  Location is a bit of walk to Padang Padang beach, but at this price you aren't gonna find closer. Only real negative is they should provide free filtered water."
"Clean, quiet rooms. Food in restaurant very tasty and pricy. Clean nice pool"
"Enjoyed staying here in the family room. Good value for money. Small complex with nice pool and really helpful friendly staff. Rent a scooter and it takes a few minutes to get to Padang Padang and other beaches. Would recommend for family looking for basic, affordable and comfortable stay."
Many gojek drivers stay there so it's convenient to start the trip from here. Room is a bit small for the price. No water provided so have to buy from marts. It's super hard to push shampoo out so I had to buy from marts too.
"Nice rooms (lived in a bungalow) with great pool. 
The restaurant and service is good. 
The location is fine but a scooter is an advantage."
"The room is not in the best condition, the cleaning stuff wouldn’t replace your towels if you won’t ask them too and it definitely need a little maintenance"
"This place is in a great location close to Padang Padang beach and Single Fin. The bedroom was fairly clean, the bed has a soft mattress with very thin sheets. AC works well but needs a key card to work so can’t cool your room while you’re out.
The bathroom clearly has not been looked after. The sink faucet was very gross, and there was mold throughout the bathroom. The bathroom has a very gross smell that lingered into the bedroom.
You have to pay 2k IDR to refill your water bottle, which is the first time we’ve stayed somewhere without free drinking water in Bali. Water is very warm too.
Overall not a bad option for a budget stay but just a few things to be aware of"
The regular room was not nice but we switched to a bungalow and that was very good. The pool is nice and the restaurant/cafe is very useful for breakfast and snacks nearby. A bit far from everyhing but very accessible with a scooter.
"Humid room, at night my eyes itched, I asked to be changed but they were full and the option they gave me was to find another place. Very nice hostel but the cheap room is not recommended"
"The hotel is good but I have a problem with it's location because, like me, I don't know how to drive a scooter so I end up strolling the streets to the beaches in Uluwatu. I like how Ms. Acen helped me through my stay in their place. She assisted me in my transportation and drive me to Ubud. Just ask her how she can be of aid and she's very willing to accommodate your request. Thanks Naturela!"
"Good location. U can rent bike for 4.5$ per day. Nearby u can discover few crazy oceansides. 10 minutes by bake to Uluwatu temple, a few min to the ocean and serfes spots. Front of hotel u can find money change and few very good and chep lical Warungs with taste food. U can also order the food and massage here. But we didnt try. And take taxi to the airport. Me and my friend payid for taxi for us around 13$ for car. But it s quite cheap. Nice  pool here."
"This is the second time ive stayed here, close to everything - single fins is just up the road - rent a ped and discover lots of cool beaches in uluwatu. 
Me and my boyfriend were backpacking and this place was great to meet other people our age - i'd say 18-30s. 
The food is really cheap and soo delicious really good for your money if your on a budget. Nice restaurants opposite such as Ulu Wasabi and an ATM & convinience store on your door step. 
Clean spacious rooms with lots of storage, nice pool and lovely family run staff :)"
"The place was very clean and spacious. We have a view for the pool and was very good.
They have a restaurant/café at the front of the hotel, very fare price and good food, makes easy to just stayed at the place and relax or eat before leave for a tourism day.
We rented a motorbike from them and on the second day we had a flat tire while driving to Padang Padang (the nearest beach), we called and the guys from the hotel came to fixed and brought a new bike for us, very good.
So, we highly recommend the place, price for the room is fare, staff is helpful and the clean is great. And for brazilians there’s just cross the road an amazing brazilian restaurante with PF (Rosella)."
"I stayed in a room with a pool view on the third level for 4 nights and was very happy with my stay for the price I paid. This is a budget option yet was better run than a more expensive place I stayed afterward. The staff are super friendly and came to clean the room everyday. The wifi and AC were strong and the room clean and comfortable though very basic as you expect at this price range.
There is a bit of construction happening in an area between the lovely pool and cafe but it didn't bother me a bit - and I worked in my room most days.
The food is good too, just maybe go up the street for breakfast.
If you want to save money and have a comfortable stay, this is a great option."
"Good place to stay if budget traveling.  Location good and close to all beautiful beaches but pretty far from city. Nice and quiet place to stay. Good wifi in rooms. Cafe in front really cheap to buy all your meals. Staff really nice and helpful.  You can rent scooter to drive around this part of island. I would highly recommend this place for that cheap price.
Only minus on my stay- i had my room in first floor and it looked like it was staff smoking area just behind my bathroom window in between two houses. Since the windows are not closed it was very upsetting to have a cigarette smell in my room all the time coming from bathroom. I asked boys kindly not to smoke there but after 1 day they were back doing same thing."
"Perfect hotel, the only downside is that it is a bit far to welk to the beach but you can rent a scooter for only 60.000 rp per day (about 4 euro). The staff was the friendliest en most helpfull then anywhere else I've been. The diner, lunch and breakfast were also very nice. The pool is also good and the rooms were very new and clean. Would definetly come again!"
"Best deal,  best price.  The place is beautiful,  well maintain,  clean,  quite,  helpful staff,... Love everything about the place"
"The rooms are good and clean, very good value for money. Suggest to get the Bungalow rooms fronting the pool. Location is also okay, it has 2 good restaurants at the front which serves delicious foods at a reasonable price."
"Paid $22 AUD on Agoda app while standing at the desk after looking through the facility.. definitely need a scooter in Uluwatu.   Short ride to Single Fin for amazing sunset. Has safe in room. No tv. Sheets and towels could be cleaner. Hot water. AC but not located well in room. 

Great for surfer or solo visitor who is hotel hopping like myself. 

Don’t expect more than you pay for and you won’t be disappointed."
"Only stayed one night but the staff was fantastic super helpful, food excellent and very cheap prices. Room immaculate, air con worked well and wifi was on point"
"Well, i can say im overwhelmed by their friendliness. You can rent a bike for rp60000 fm the hotel. If you are the type of adventurous traveller, this place is perfect for you. A little note, there is no tv in the room. Overall, i really enjoyed my stay here. Will definitely, come again."
"Nice location with a lot of GOOD restaurants near, also great breakfast/lunch restaurant at the hotel! Cleaning was so good and they do it every day, and you also get new towels every day! Super chill pool area where we spend almost every afternoon!"
"We had reservated a deluxe room and when we arrived it was not available so they gave us a Standard one. (Of course we got the price difference back from agoda). The room is quite small and has no TV. The swimmingpool was really good, the only problem is that they are building a new part of the hotel next to it and the noise was bit annoying. We rented a scooter for a day in the hotel. The staff was helpful giving us directions. Do not hire a driver in the hotel, they charge too much."
Hotel is very clean and the bungalow room was very nice but other than that I would not recommend this hotel. Hotel is a 25 minute walk from the Padang Padang beach which is not ideal since half the way there is no sidewalk. If you can ride a motor bike then this hotel may be better suited for you. For us we had to either walk really far to get places or pay lots of money for taxi/private shuttle. The room does not come with any tolietries or even hand soap. Staff treats you more like a number than a guest.
"The room was great for the price! Hot shower, air con, comfortable bed. About 5 minute bike ride to Padang Padang. The only con is it's under some major construction, don't plan on taking a nap. very noisey! Once this place is finished it will be a great place to stay."
"The rooms are beautiful, get an upstairs bungalow if you can as they are airy and spacious! A little building work going on at the moment but it really shouldn't bother you! It is low season after all and good on them for renovating! It's going to be a great establishment once it's finished. Loved our stay here so much we extended by 4 nights instead of moving on. Can rent mopeds from the homestay, ATM, restaurants and mini mart close by. Everything you could want. 5 minute moped ride to various beaches. We loved it here! Will 100% be back"
"I will most likely stay here again next time I'm in the area.  Basic place, but the staff is awesome, beer and food is priced great and delicious, location is great, pool is sweet.  Wifi was fine."
"I recommended this hotel for a group of around 20 friends as we were all coming from my wedding in Bali, so we clearly bring money to the business. We went out for dinner and I brought a little take away for my baby who stayed at the hotel with grandma, when I asked hotel for a plate to serve him they said NO, can someone believe?????? My baby didn't eat much and I want to keep left overs to serve him next day so as they don't offer in room fridge I asked hotel staff to keep it at their fridge and guess what was the answer again??? NO! UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! One thing is not incentive guest to bring food from outside as they also run a cafe, but a completely opposite is to NOT HAVE ANY COMMON SENSE and help to keep or serve baby's food. This place can have a nice location and price and food from their cafe is good, but I'll definitely NEVER COME BACK neither will any of the 20 friends that stayed there with me. Btw, besides the not polite and unhelpful reception lady, restaurant staff was n"
"Pro's: the pool area is lovely, the rooms are clean and the on site restaurant serves good food at good prices. It is located in a quiet area but best to rent a scooter to get around. 
Con's: the aircon wasn't very cold and the blankets and sheets were too small for the bed. 
We stayed in the standard room, and I would still recommend it even with the few cons, but if you  an afford the bungalow rooms, those are tops!"
"We stayed in the bungalows, and they were really clean and really nice. The pool os clean. But the food of the reataurant/café was the Best. From western food to local food they got really good options... The breakfast was very good also. I definetely would stay again there, no doubt."
"This was my 3rd time staying here and I definitely recommend it, the price is reasonable and the location is perfect for me, they make the best Nasi Goreng too!"
Clean and beautiful room..we stayed in a Bungalow with big Bed.
Towels and sheets were completely stained. We had a loud banging noise froom the roof which was completely disregarded by the staff. Abd the a/c barely
"We had 4 beautiful days at this hotel. Super friendly and helpful staff, everything is clean and the food is good !"
"Lovely hotel & pool area. Great on-site cafe & place to buy water/juice. Good location with restaurants nearby & beach only 5-10 min drive. 
Drains in room smelled a little & there was building work going on outside our room so more on the expensive end considering that."
"We enjoyed our stay at Naturela, and used the swimming pool, laundry, and cafe facilities while staying there. The staff were really helpful, and it’s in a nice spot with restaurant options close by too."
"Staff were so kind & accommodating and allowed me to check in early (I was exhausted after a long flight). Felt safe the whole time, room was clean, UK adaptable wall outlets was a huge plus, and the location was great too. Will definitely be staying here when I’m next down in Bingin! Makasi 🙏🏼"
Good location. Spacious room with plenty of storage space. But moved out after two nights even without refunds. The owners were unfriendly and unhelpful. Towels were grey. Bedsheet smells like the whole bottle of softener was on it it giving me massive headache.  It’s just an overall unpleasant atmosphere for me
"Situated near cafes that are walkable distance. Staff are okay, not the friendliest, minimally helpful.
The room itself is clean and well kept. Really worth the price."
"Loved our stay here, the restaurant was amazing and we ate there every day, also super cheap"
"It was ok, but noisy (kind of a party hotel) and not very clean."
Amazing food and lovely staff. Everything about naturela is good apart from the slightly weak water pressure of the sink and shower.
"First, at 8 AM the hostel constructors made all kind of noises next to my room (hammer, saw, etc.)
Then the staff knocked on my door insistently to clean the room.  And they didn’t stop even  when I said ""I'm sleeping”.
Finally, minutes after they stopped knocking on my door, they scrubbed the floor, making water, broom and voices noises.  I opened the bedroom door for 3 times to ask them to stop, and even using google translator to ensure communication, they didn't stop.
In my view, the main problem is that the staff is not trained and do not know how to deal with things that are unexpected.
I explained my point at the reception and the manager sent me a message informing  that in the following day they would assure  silence until 10 AM. They, indeed, kept quiet until the mentioned time."
"The place was great. They have a pool and a restaurant so it's convenient. The food is good and cheap. The room and toilet are spacious and clean. Not too far from padang or bingin beach, 20 min walk. I do feel like if you don't drive a scooter you might find it a bit far from everything but overall would recommend the place."
"There is huge construction on and on the main road , that was something not mentioned when I was there last week 
Great cheap cafe ,classic Balinese 
Staff are just lovely 
Best restaurant over the road Sugar rocks"
Jack hammer first thing in the mornings
"Me and my family (2 small children) choose for this hotel because they provided a bungalow with separate double beds. The kids could sleep on the 'attic' which was nice for them, though for younger kids a bit dangerous. 
Overall, I would not recommend this place because this place lacked of a nice atmosphere. Everything seemed a bit old and messy. If they took more time and money in the interior and exterior of the property and if they make it more nicely it could work out for me."
"The staff came inside our room and switch a bed, when we came back all of our things were on the floor."
"best nice awesome wonderfull 
best nice awesome wonderfull 
best nice awesome wonderfull"
"Fantastic tropical traditional Balinese accomodation situated between Padang& bingin.
Lovely& quiet and good food at a reasonable price.Family bungalow was awesome"
"Not very friendly staff. And they didn’t have a bike available for renting when we got there. The rest was ok. The bedroom was good, pool area beautiful."
Toilet didn’t flush very well and ac was pretty bad and badly located. Really good food at the restaurant and nice pool!!
A short stay but loved the place!
"Stayed for 2 nights, after the first night we asked the staff to make up our room. But they didn't even change the towels. Toothbrush was not provided, blanket was just a thin wool material blanket. Location was quite far from uluwatu downtown, however it's close to the beaches."
"+nice bungalow 
+good food
+good place for surfers 
+friendly staff
- I think there are better places to rent a scooter"
"A lovely, small, quiet modern guest house, in a good position."
"Pro: clean, staff were friendly, great pool area and nice rooms.
Cons: difficult to walk to beaches, when the hotel driver was unavailable the staff were reluctant to help me book a different mode of transport."
"The bungalows here were cool. Well, the top level ones are, with the high ceilings. All-around nice place. There was no hot water when I stayed though."
"The Hotel/Homestay is under construction at the Moment and the construction work was directly next to our room. We asked the staff for a solution and they offered us a Room on the second Floor, what absolutly didn't make sense because they are Building a new staircase. Of course we got the room next to the new staircase again. We asked for another Solution because we didn't wanted to stay, but they said it won't be noisy the day after and were not very impressed. I don't have to say that it was of course noisy. That was the Point that we talked to agoda to cancel our booking. the Hotel offered us an Upgrade to an Apartment but you Could still hear the Noise in the room so we searched a new Homestay in the near. It was a Bad Situation for us but i really think if they don't have construction work its a nice Homestay in a lovely Area with a good Restaurant. So hopefully they finsh their work soon and everything will be Fine then :)"
"Lovely pool area, good food prices at the restaurant, clean rooms."
Changed room 3 times as the first room had scaffolding around it and the workmen could see inside. The second one only had a bed in the room. Paid extra and had the upstairs bungalow which was very nice. Food and drink very good. You need a bike or a car to get anywhere. Be ok once renavastions are complete.

I'd definitely stay here again!!
"Awful experience at this hotel. Zero hospitality. So rude to their guests. Was relieved to get away from this horrible place. Also- definitely not a ""hotel""."
Really Nice place to stay. Nice people. Staff took care of us. Especially on Silence day. Will come back. Thank you!
"Good value, very friendly and helpful staff who speak English well. It's right on the road, they will rent you a scooter to get around- it's necessary. A couple downsides were the bathroom/shower combo- the entire bathroom was always wet due to poor draining. And, the odor in my room was of chemicals. Overall, for the money, it still seemed like a good value."
"Room  smell strongly chemical produits could not sleep be cause of that, distance from the hotel to the beach it's 40 minutes by walking not 10 minutes!! Nothing Around.  The only positive point it is the staff."
Very good except weak shower and chicken noise.
"Lo único q le agregaría es un refrigerador en la
Habitación y el agua de la ducha era salada, personal muy amable limpiaban el cuarto todos los días. Desayuno hay mejores opciones cerca"
"El personal es súper amable, la comida del resto es riquísima, tienen mucha variedad y a buen precio!
Las habitaciones cómodas y limpias y la ducha es perfecta! 
Regresaría sin pensarlo"
"El personal super amable,la habitacion bastante confortable lo que estan ampliando y desde las 7am dando martillazos al lado de la habitacion."
Wifi muy malo
"Estuvo bastante bien mejor de lo esperado íbamos por 5 dias y nos quedamos 10, el personal que trabaja es amable y te ayuda. El alquiler de motos es barato y las motos están muy bien con sistemas para transportar las tablas de surf. A veces fallaba el agua caliente pero sin importancia por el calor que hace. Lo mejor de la ubicación es que a 100 metros carretera abajo esta un restaurante llamado JIWA JUICE que ofrece unos desayunos y comida increíbles y asequibles, regentado por un malagueño muy simpatico."
Parfait emplacement entre les plages et les restaurants. Super beau comme hotel et belle piscine. Personnelle très agréable et gentil!
"Belle piscine, restaurant à même l’hôtel. 
Par contre notre chambre sentait l’humidité, il y avait des fourmis et la peinture des murs s’écaillaient. Besoin de la carte de la chambre pour avoir l’électricité, ce qui fait qu’en sortant de la chambre il n’y a plus d’air clim. Loin des restaurants et magasins."
"Endroit bien situé géographiquement, bon petit restaurant.
Mais .... rénovation de chambre sur 3 étages et travaux débutant à 8:15 am .... le soir j'ai dû avertir un responsable car il était 18:30 PM et rien n'arrêtait.
Propreté laisse à désirer ... les murs était ma propre"
"Nous sommes restés 2 nuits à cette hôtel où nous étions très bien. Le restaurant était très bon et pas très cher, de plus vous pouvez acheté à manger aussi aux alentours pour vraiment pas cher. Nous avons loué le scooter 6 dollars les 24 heures nous avons pu visiter le temps et les plages."
Bien.
"Zimmer sind OK und sauber! Frühstück und Preise dafür sind top in dem Restaurant,bin öfter deshalb wieder gekommen.
Der Pool ist ganz nett,das Zimmer direkt dran zu haben aber nicht. Sehr hellhörig. Man hört den Nachbarn strullen. Preis /Leistung allerdings wirklich gut,da die Lage zentral und trotzdem ruhig ist"
"Während unseres Aufenthaltes wurde der komplette Bereich um den Pool gerade umgebaut, die Arbeiten sollten mittlerweile schon fertig sein und dadurch ist es sicher auch ruhiger und gemütlicher."
ok!
"Die Lage ist für Ausflüge in den Norden gänzlich ungeeignet. Man brauch fast 2h bis Denpasar. Mein Zimmer lag am Pool, hinter dem ein neues Hotel entsteht. Mega Baulärm ab 7h morgens ist garantiert. Die Mopeds sind recht günstig zu leihen - umgerechnet 4€/Tag, aber der Zustand ist unterirdisch! Repariert wird erst bei defekt - auch bei den Reifen, der mir 50km vom Hotel entfernt geplatzt ist. Und niemand im Hotel war erreichbar! Am Ende hätte ich das Ding auch noch zahlen sollen, aber nein danke - nicht bei dem Zustan (Slick). Ich war auch n Chat der einzige, der Pannen mit den Dingern hatte... Ansonsten ist man recht schnell bei einigen guten Surfständen. Zu essen findet man fussläufig nicht, muss also dort essen, denn nachts dort auf dem Roller gleicht einem Himmelfahrtskommando. Bei meinem nächsten Bali besuch bin ich auf jeden Fall woanders."
"A circa 20 minuti a piedi da Padang Padang, staff gentile e disponibile, possibilità di noleggiare scooter, ottimo ristorante a prezzi fantastici"
"Grote luxe en ruime bungalow aan het zwembad. Heerlijk tot rust komen..
Het hotel heeft een leuk en gezellig restaurant/ cafe aan de weg."
"Het bed was net een plank, beide vreselijk last van onze rug na het slapen. Tevens maar 1 wc rol, niet handig als je last van je buik hebt en het midden in de nacht is;)"
"Lekker eten in een mooie tuin, prima zwembad en centrale ligging. Ideaal om op verkenning te gaan met de scooter."
"Nos hospedamos por uma noite e gostamos da acomodação! O quarto e banheiro sao limpos, porém as roupas de cama são bem velinhas e amarelinhas… mas cheirosos e limpas. A piscina é uma delícia, o restaurante é ótimo e barato, e a localização não é super perto da praia mas de moto fica fácil chegar em qq lugar. Para quem busca custo benefício recomendo."
"Tudo muito bom. Só a internet que poderia ser um pouco melhor, não funciona muito bem no quarto."
"Localização perfeita. Não tem café da manhã incluído mas os preços do hotel, seja para café ou almoço, são bons e justos."
"Limpeza , troca de toalhas, banheiro exaustor barulhento , mas ficaria com certeza de novo no hotel , pelo preço localização e staff gente boa ,🤙😀."
"Lokasi sangat strategis dan tidak menyeramkan suasana nya, hanya saja tidak ada tv untuk kamar saya yg di lantai 3"
"Air panas tidak ada,TV tidak ada,kolam renang terlalu bahaya utk anak2 krn kedalaman 2meter. Air pancuran seperti ada bau2 tak sedap"
"• КОМНАТЫ 
Большие чистые комнаты. Особенно понравилась высоченный потолок (типичная Балтийская крыша), много пространства. К самим комнатам претензий нет, все новое, чистое. Только душ долго греется (может только в нашей комнате) до горячей воды. И не хватало чая. В комнатах нет ни холодильника, ни чайника с чашками. Можно было бы поставить, как обычно это бывает в отелях.
• КАФЕ
Отличное кафе: огромное меню на любой вкус, быстро, по ценам доступно, вкусно.  
• ГОСТИ ОТЕЛЯ 
Но самое раздражающее, конечно, это другие жильцы. После 10 вечера (хотя на дереве у бассейна есть просьба администрации не шуметь и соблюдать тишину) семейство играло в водное поло, так что слышно было всем. Просили их дважды прекратить шуметь (потому как с нами был ребенок 7 месяцев и он уже спал). Но они почемуто настаивали на том, что шуметь можно до 11 вечера. Вот такое неуважение в другим расстраивает. Но это не вина отеля. Отелю большая благодарность. Если буду возвращаться на Улувату, то туда."
"Очень удобное расположение , несколько красивых пляжей близко 
Очень удобно что кафе прямо при отеле , кушали только тут , по ценам ниже чем в округе и очень вкусно, панкейки на завтрак ели каждый день очень понравились 
В номере не было телевизора, но в других вроде есть , это не значительно так как мы его и не смотрим 
минус :
были полотенца Серые ( застиранные ) но на Бали это не редкость так что не обращали внимания на это 
Стройка рядом"
"Хороший отель, удобное месторасположение если брать байк в аренду. Кухня вкусная и дешевая, своевременно убираются. Хорошие чистые номера. Отзывчивый персонал"
Замечательно. Только полотенца не меняют.
"Очень хорошее место для любого вида отдыха, хоть парой, хоть семьёй, хоть тусовкой. Из другого гэстхауса нас забрали и привезли в Натурелу по хорошему прайсу, по нашему пожеланию поменяли номер на другой ( с первого этажа на третий). Отличный чистый бассейн, двор, а готовят там нереально вкусно и хорошие цены. Всем советую"
"Stannade här i fyra nätter innan vi skulle åka hem! Bästa stället i hela Bali och vi villa absolut inte lämna. Poolen var toppen lika så rummen! Bästa var maten på restaurangen, massa alternativ och billigt! Vi hyrde moppe varje dag och åkte runt till alla fina stränder som finns i närheten! Skulle absolut bo här igen om jag åkte till Bali!!"
Nära till stranden
Mycket bra valuta för pengarna
"Отличный отель. Чисто, номера свежие уютные. Отличная дешевая кухня."
