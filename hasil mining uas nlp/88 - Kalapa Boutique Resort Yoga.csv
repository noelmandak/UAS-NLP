"I had a lovely 7 night solo stay in a private pool room after 5 nights with my sisters at another hotel closer to the beach. Yoga classes are included in your stay (which were great but if you have your own mat I would bring it, I ended up practicing on the wooden floor). Yoga teacher was absolutely fantastic. The hotel grounds are beautiful, staff were wonderful, food was quite nice (only ate a couple of meals from hotel) plenty of veg/vegan options! Definitely recommend hiring a scooter so you are able to get around easily as it’s a little bit back from the busier area (which I absolutely loved) There is also a bagel cafe close by which is phenomenal! Delicious coffee! Only thing I could say that was negative (not even really negative) is the plunge pool in the villa is completely in the shade so no sun catches it. The hotel pool is absolutely wonderful though so spent all my time there. Would stay here again!"
"Had an amazing stay at the resort. Enjoying the facilities around the resort. They have two pools you can swim, very beautiful and relaxing. The room is spacious and well maintained. Really enjoyed the bathtub and private pool. The room smelled so good like in a spa. They also provided very nice toiletries and salt bath which usually not provided by other hotel, so it’s a plus point. The resort is quite so it’s very good for someone looking to relax. The yoga class provided was great too!"
"Super pleased with the quality of service and the staff were super friendly. Staying in Kalapa was affordable and very value for money. We had a floating breakfast in our private pool which was nice for photos and it felt very personal and special. We did not have to pay a high price for that experience in which we were very pleased.  We spent a day at the pool and it was very clean and relaxing too. Just to make sure you have enough mosquito repellant on! Would like to commend Nico, one of the service staff, for being so kind and helpful."
"We loved the surrounding the most, very lush and green. Sound of nature was incredible. Pools were very nice and clean, wooden bungalows with a stylish decor.  Lovely freshly made meals at the restaurant on site. Location is good, quite but close to restaurants and bars. Will come back again."
"We booked a couple of nights here last minute at a discounted rate. A little tricky to find (go down the alleyway) but once we had arrived we were smiling from ear to ear. Lovely reception staff and set in lush gorgeous gardens. When the door to our luxury villa opened, we were both silent... it was beautiful... and creative... and organic. Just stunning, down to earth yet glamorous. We ordered room service twice and were exceptionally pleased with the quality. As with all hotels in  Bali at the moment, they are trying to get all the wheels moving again, get properties back to perfect and staff trained up fully. Regardless, the most professional and pleasing experience of the four locations that we stayed at on this trip. Throughly recommend a stay at Kalapa! 🙂"
"Kalapa resort is a magnificent and really amazingly beautiful hideaway. Although located near by the bustling streets of canggus hip Resto’s & nightlife spots it’s the perfect place to find yourself far away from the worlds rush in Kalapas quiet tropical gardens. The room-concept with its wooden walls and floors and a wide range of carefully designed details made Kalapa resort definitely one of the best places we ever came across traveling asia. Beside that the staff working there is a great great gift too!!! All over wonderful people hosted us. 
We will definitely try to come back as soon as we can!"
"We super love everything about this villa. All the staffs are very nice, the room pool and everything is amazing. We had the room with pool and we really really in love and wanted to extend stay but it was fully booked. They also have yoga classes that we love. You guys should try!"
"We glad we stayed at this hotel. Great place, great food, great value for money, indeed! Staff are nice and welcoming. Will definitely recommend to my friends whoever wishes to have a relaxing stay in Bali 😌🍃✨"
"I love love this resort. Great location, very quite, love the whole resort concept, huge rooms, comfortable bed. And Great hospitality (shout to Emmy & Nico who made my stay super wonderful, they were really helpful and super nice)"
I came with a friend and we stayed in one of the bungalows. The facilities were beautiful and the staff so lovely! They have the yoga classes on and the instructor Agus was just so kind. I am keen to come back again and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to someone who wants a quiet moment and happy to just be. The hotel is only 15mins from town by car or bike :)
"We're glad we stayed at this hotel! Great place, great food, great value for money, indeed! Will definitely recommend this place to my friend! Will come back again next year too!"
"Tucked in far from the hustle bustle of Seminyak beach. It takes about 30-40mins by car to the main Seminyak beach. Lovely room with own private pool. Place was clean, staff was kind, breakfast was okay."
"The best resort ever i've stayed. I really love the room, surroundings and the vibes. Staff also very friendly! Very perfect for my honeymoon. Love from Malaysia."
"The bed in the room is comfortable, the staff are wonderful and the facilities are good. I really like this hotel, I think I will visit again"
"Honestly a little paradise on earth for those who love Bali. A quick ride away from the center of Canggu. But you could stay here a month that you have all you need in the resort. Pool, food, good service, yoga classes, spa, a second pool, scooter garage etc etc. But most of all the beauty of the landscape and their cozy ‘rooms’ (houses). Enjoy!"
"Such a sanctuary in hectic canggu.  Ubud feel just near the hustle and bustle of canggu.  Loved the pools and comfortable bed.  The restaurant was only open for breakfast but that forced me off the property, otherwise I’d probably not have left there it’s so nice."
"This was a beautiful private villa with private pool. The outside public pool was also just stunning. Everything was clean and well maintained. The people were lovely. Our room was comfortable and the outdoor bathroom was really great. Would stay here again. Only feedback I would have is that as it is a villa near the jungle, it can get quite loud at night with all the animals but that just adds to the charm of such a wonderful peaceful place. Loved it."
"This place is stunning and the pictures don’t Actually do it enough justice.
It’s a little hidden gem that feels like you are in Ubud whilst you really in Canggu.
Staff are great and the rooms are huge both pools are beautifully positioned too l.
Highly recommended"
It’s nestled away in the quiet side of Canggu. Feels like you’re in a forest (well you are). Very peaceful & quiet. The staff are amazing. Enjoyed my stay here.
"LISTEN GUYS, YOU WILL NOT REGRET STAYING HERE. The room was so spacious, rates was really affordable for that standard offered. Service was great, friendly staff. I WILL REPEAT, I PROMISE!"
"Beautiful resort away from the hustle and bustle of Canggu nestled among the trees. We had a really relaxing stay, loved the plunge pool in our room and the outdoor bath. There are also two pools to relax by, and the yoga classes they provide for free are also a great bonus. The restaurant serves a good selection of tasty food, a bit on the pricier side but there are plenty of restaurants a short taxi ride away. Breakfast was tasty and a good selection. They provide mosquito repellent and a net over the bed, but prepare to be bitten!! All in all a stunning hotel and we would definitely come back."
"The resort is very beautiful and was maintained and cleaned daily. The staff are very approachable and friendly. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed during my stay as not been used during the pandemic. However, there is a multitude of local warnings within walking distance and the staff were able to order breakfast for me in the morning. The bungalows are very spacious and comfortable. I just loved the traditional style. All in all a great experience."
"I will be coming back here. It was such a lovely experience. Very relaxing, beautiful views, lovely staff, great yoga. Excellent value. The food was ok."
I had an amazing time staying at kalapa. This hidden gem was one of the most peaceful and thankfully underrated resorts in Canggu. I'll definitely be back. Thanks for the experience!
"Found this hotel on Agoda and enjoyed a lot of perks - free yoga classes, complimentary drink on arrival and free afternoon tea. The rooms are spacious and all staff are friendly and attentive to your needs. The resort didn't feel too crowded when I was there and was able to just enjoy my time there in peace."
"Hotel and room were great. Very nice and clean room, both up to very high standards and nicer than some 5* hotels. Staff was friendly and helpful. Hotel is on the outskirts of Canggu and surrounded by nature, which created a nice atmosphere but was also quite loud during the night (April) due to insects/animals"
"My partner and I spent 3 nights and Kalapa and really enjoyed our stay.
The staff were all so lovely and welcoming and the resort grounds and room were beautiful.
It’s not really walking distance from the main part of Canggu/beach but we found it very easy to get transport to and from with Gojek so we didn’t mind. 
Definitely a great place for a romantic stay and I would happily return."
"We stayed as a couple for 3 nights in Apr 2022 in the Premium Bungalow. 
This unit has an outdoor toilet, and a very outdoor bath tub. The bath tub is not realistic for use as it has many fallen leaves, and an occasional snail climbing on the sides. If the management can install a canopy on the top, and reduce the foliage, it would be so much cleaner. Being located in the deep of the plantation, you will see an occasional bug inside, but it is the aggressive crickets that start chirping at 630am that is personally hardest to get used to.
On that note, we shared about the sighting bugs with the concierge after the first night (they had asked proactively!) the IC immediately looked very concerned and serious, which left the most impression on us. Thank you so much for taking care of us!
Yoga classes also happens 4 times a day, accommodating about 5 pax. But as the attendees will all have a different level of experience, expect these classes to be quite basic."
"Beautiful resort. Very well maintained. Spacious rooms with comfy beds 
Would definitely recommend."
"A short ride from the center of Canggu yet in a quiet and lovely green resort. Two pools, a river cutting the land in half and frogs to tell you when it’s time to go for dinner😋"
"Just perfect. Good food. Amazing landscape. Out of the noise. 2 pools!
Just a dream hideaway stay for holidays."
"Just perfect. Good food. Amazing landscape. Out of the noise. 2 pools!
Just a dream hideaway stay for holidays."
"This resort was a little slice of Ubud in busy Canggu! I didn't even want to leave my resort. The swimming pools had perfect sun weather.  The rooms are gorgeous but it is in nature - be sure to wear your mosquito repellent. The food is ok, the complimentary afternoon tea is one food item with a drink."
Everything was excellent never wanted to leaveeeeeeee.
Love my stay here!!! The staffs were friendly. Had a blast.
"Stayed here 1 night with my wife, beautiful garden, restaurants and swimming pool. The breakfast was delicious. Staff are pretty helpful and friendly. Very clean and spacious rooms. Absolutely value for money."
"Jalapa is A complete retreat from the bustle of Canggu, a retreat to escape it all. Quiet, very relaxing and the staff were so very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended for solo travellers, couples who want to chill out for a few days. I stayed for two weeks and loved every day!"
"When we arrived they gave us a traditional welcome drink, there are two pool on this area the front pool near the enterance of the  villas and the back pool, they offering us which pool we want to swim and the next morning they already put the towel on both pool."
Their suite room with pool is awesome. Property is same as shown in pictures.
"Had 2nights to enjoy the villa, short ride from the centre. Amazing how it design the landscape, villa with jungle sense, and away from busy world! Easy to get local foods, not far from beach clubs.
Love the atmosphere, quiet and peace.
We enjoyed the room service menus! Every dishes were delicious
Staffs are super friendly and helpful 
Things to highlight is mozzies are around, they bite. So make sure to close your door all the time! & repellent
No coffee/tea and kettle to have your own in villa. Have to order every morning.
Also hopefully management will consider to fix the driveway it’s rough to ride. And consider as safety issue as well.
Overall everything is great, we will come back next in future again."
Kalapa is amazing our house was 🤩 stunning
It’s so fresh. Even tho it’s in the middle of the green there’s no mosquito
This resort quite convenient. Nearest to the beach & all facilities. If you needs some places to calm I would recommend going to this places.
Loveeeee the room that we stayed in! Very calm & peaceful.
"Lovely and lush jungle-like gardens, very peaceful during the day and early evening.  
We booked a room with our own pool. The room was small and simple. Kettle, coffee, tea, cups & saucers had to be ordered as there were none in the room.
The rooms really carry sound and I guess we were unlucky that throughout our stay our neighbors played loud music and were very noisy until the early hours of the morning so we didn't get much sleep. 
Breakfast was simple, but ok.  The earliest we could have breakfast was 8am.
The wifi service in our room was spotty and not good enough for zoom calls or streaming to tablet/phone, but TV streaming was very smooth.  
The water pressure in the bathroom was very good; bathroom is open air but there's a curtain for privacy. Our room was kept very clean and the staff were very attentive."
Would really recommend this place to my friends!
The cozy place to relax with ubud ambience. Beautiful resort. Love it!
"Beautiful and tranquil. Lovely staff. Beautiful lounging and pool areas. 
Smaller complaint, Mosquito net over bed had mold on it and so did some of the pool day beds. Food in restaurant could be tastier, but all very affordable and good selection."
Will definitely come back again. They have scheduled yoga sessions everyday and staffs were very friendly and helpful! Love the villa it was so cozy although lightings were quite dim at night. There were some ants and millipedes issue but understandable as we’re in the nature. Overall amazing experience
Really nice staff.. everything was great but please the 2 street dogs that run around the whole place and beg for food was a real put off and ended up staying in room most the time. Staff said they were trying to move them as they kept getting in.
"Great yoga teacher with 3 classes a day available, spa, pool, great food.
My room was Beautiful and had a rustic charm. Nice to be a bit out of the way of the hustle."
"I had a blast, privacy and the best time"
"I came during COVID season so it was quiet, but the staff are very nice and helpful. Many options for breakfast which is great, would definitely come back"
Great place for honeymoon!
brilliant resort with great staff and customer service. be prepared to shower and use the toilet in the open and fine with insects / caterpillars running around.
"Got the cheap price to stay here. A bit worried that the place at first, but i looovvveee this place. Want to back to stay here again when i get the cheap price again ofc 😁"
"Pool area was great and right by our room, staff were always extremely friendly. The room was pretty good, clean and bedding was comfortable. Had lots of bugs and mosquitos in the room though as there are no windows, just shutters. Outdoors bathroom was lovely, bath area was great! Location was a little tricky as we had to get rides everywhere, nothing is within walking distance. A bit hard to find, we arrived at night and had a really hard time finding the driveway, would be great to have a light on the sign."
"so nice hotel for take a picture and they rent me a bicycle for free, it was so nice to look around"
"The room with own swimming pool was perfect! Nicely located in a sort of jungle. 'Public' hotel swimming pools were nice and clean too. We only felt that we missed some professionalism from the staff in terms of knowing the area for tips in Canggu (restaurants, what to do, etc). We missed that type of customer experience that you'd expect from such a resort in Bali."
"Extremely stylish, high quality and generously proportioned villas offering good taste, value for money and facilities such as yoga, restaurant, pool and spa. Quiet location a bit out of town. Which means you can really relax at the villa and then after a quick Gojek enjoy everything Canggu has to offer. Recommend! Secret spot! Hardly any villas are this kind of quality and value."
"Nice resort with a pretty wild and lush landscaping, a little dusty in some parts but quite clean in others. 
Room could be lit a little better, but lighting is warm. Breakfast is simple, with a handful of the same options daily, nothing to shout about. 
The pool in the room does not get much sun, so is quite cold - cute trick would be to fill in the bathtub with hot water and dip between the two :)"
"We enjoyed the stay, the resort is .beautifully designed and nice and quiet and relaxing.    Fda 1xy"
"We stayed 5 nights in the luxury Villa. It was huge but very dark. We enjoyed the swimming pool, the quietness and the location a bit outside of canggu and its traffic. Breakfast was average, and staff were very nice but need a bit more training. Everything was ok but lightly overpriced for the overall experience."
"The Pool villa was nice, the premium bungalow that I spent the last night in not so much. Really weird smell like and hair and dirt all over the bathroom. The hotel charged me 130k for a wine glass I dropped which I found pretty outrageous and ridiculous. Staff is lovely though. Location is quite far off from everything"
"if you like to nature and yoga, you must stay here"
"Not what I was expecting, staff friendly but not enough info given on check in on facilities, services that were not available not told about, very isolated and need transport to go any where. Very noisy can hear people coming and going all night. Website doesn’t say anything about taxes that are not included on everything that you purchase. On a positive yoga was very good and able to attend 2 sessions a day if you wanted."
"Baby crib for 250K per night made me feel angry about that place. In all other hotels we stayed it was complementary! Also so many mosquitoes there. Actually atmosphere was beautiful and the staff was very helpful and friendly, but charging so much for a baby crib is ridiculous."
"Wasn't the best experience at Kalapa Resort. The staff wasn't welcoming, didn't respond to any special request we have made to them. We booked a villa with private pool which had a weird smell, wasn't clean, had spider webs around the corners and the open bathroom with pool had lots of mosquitoes and  insects. The food at the restaurant was just average. Don't know how this resort is well rated online. You will find much better properties at Canggu at a better price."
"Canggu is very busy, developing part of Bali, the roads are way to scaring for a novice bike rider and the taxis are not cheap so getting around is not easy and this resort in not close to anything, walking to the beach is not an option. The front desk people had limited English so getting things organised was frustrating."
"Easy to access around the streets however Bath tub wasn't clean since the water tap/tank was releasing dirty water. Plans for bath tub experience was ruined.  Too many unwanted guests such as spiders, bees, hornets, crickets etc. More actions can be taken other than placing coils. Space shown in website is not true to real size. Otherwise, service provided was good."
"Room had no glass on windows, the family in room next door with lively kids up till 11.30pm, at 4.15 another neighbor with heals on wooden floor slamming doors, at 7.15 am gardeners chopping wood next to room. + mosquitoes + bugs + rat on roof + room full of dead bugs. 
Premises & gardens are nice, room spacious with decent amenities, shame for the rest. I checked out after 1 night having already payed for 3 !!!!"
"My room is old, all is falling apart. On the photo things were much better. I always have a problem with hot water, they promised to fix it, but I take a slight warm shower, not hot, sometimes cold at all. Mosquitos are everywhere, it’s crazy. Good is not tasty for me.
Furanture is old and mostly broken. The territory is not well organaised and not clean as well.
Positive is staff here, alsways ready to help and pleasant to talk and good yoga. That’s all.
Lovely nature around and sounds of nature."
the villa we stay is too damp and there is not sunshine in the day time which gives a very depressing feelings. and there are  tea and cafe and hot water kettle in the vila.
"Book elsewhere. Stayed with 10month old baby. Mosquito netting over the bed had blood stains on it and rips. Floors were incredibly filthy. Very dim, dark rooms. We are experienced travellers, third time in Bali and this falls way below Balinese standards. The moat around the rooms has so much garbage floating in it. Lots of mosquitoes. The restaurant served up frostbitten, old food that was pretty much just microwaved and delivered via room service. 
Book elsewhere."
"Sadly, we did not get the room we booked. The space itself is super fragile, you take one step on the wooden floors, and one item or piece of furniture falls. It's almost unlivable.  We were really looking forward to liking this place. The access to the hotel itself is super steep downhill towards the entrance. The sheets were dirty day after day even after requesting for our room to be made up. There were stains on the sheets, towels and curtains by the bed. Possibly might have bed bugs too because we were itchy from head to toe after sleeping on the bed. Disappointed."
"We booked this hotel because the social media photos looked so fancy. And the room indeed was cute, huge, and clean. But I had my worst nightmare experience when we discovered a snake in the room! And it was so difficult to get the staff to help us. They were nonchalant and treated us like we are crazy to be jumping at the sight of a snake in our ""luxury villa""! We had 5 more hours to check-out, but i immediately packed my bags and left to use the restroom outside of the hotel. The property is not maintained properly. The outdoor tiles are slippery, on which I fell and sprained my ankle. The staff is so woefully untrained that they didn't even offer a word of empathy and come to my aid. They didn't even have a first aid box. 
The food was TERRIBLE! I have never seen or tasted a worse green curry chicken! We sent the food back but they still charged us! And the breakfast pancakes smelled of rotten eggs! Rudest staff ever!"
"Rooms are so badly designed and not maintained, windows are broken, bathtub so dirty that it has scales, dried leaves and crawlies on it.
With room that dark and broken wooden windows, it felt more like a torture chamber than a room.
Checked out within the same hour. Didn't even bother to stay even a night. Regretted the purchase."
"Kalapa was even better than the photos or reviews indicated, and we already had high expectations (hence, our booking). It is so pretty and peaceful. You hardly even know there are other guests there! Nothing is too much for the staff and they are consistently friendly and unobtrusive. Whilst an eight minute ride from Canggu, it isn't hard or expensive to organise a lift and the yoga was fabulous. A very well maintained place, my only suggestions for improvement would be to have the air conditioner over the bed (as it didn't reach me and I was quite hot at night) and perhaps to schedule yoga earlier in the day so day trips are more do-able. That said, it made us relax waiting for yoga each day. Canggu is a sensational place to stay."
"Our first trip to Bali and staying in this magical place was exactly what we hoped it to be! Dark teak wood everywhere, very atmospheric and classy!
It was like we were living in a Balinese home. Loved every minute of it!
The grounds were well kept, the 2 swimming pools were simply stunning. The whole layout of the place was perfect! No wonder people were constantly taking those perfect instagram snaps. We saw models using this place for photoshoots, we are not suprised why they chose Kalapa.
Every morning there was complimentary yoga which was also a bonus, Daniella the teacher was really good!
We used the complimentary bikes, which you do need transport as it is too far to walk to go anywhere. There is a complimentary shuttle aswell, incase you don't like to drive a bike or scooter. Taxis are also very cheap. 
If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle, live in paradise then this is the place to be!!!!"
"Myself and my wife landed in Bali after a late flight and wanted somewhere easy to stay. We loved the look of Kalapa and they were super helpful to arrange a taxi from the airport for us (extra cost). We planned to head up towards Ubud the following day so this was the perfect base to do so.
The whole place is extremely peaceful and the rooms are beautiful. They have 2 pools (we preferred the one at the back of the hotel) and breakfast was included (and yummy!!). We would definitely book again. Thanks guys!"
"Everything was exceptional from the moment we stepped foot out of our car to the moment we left, every little thing was exceptional through and through. The hotel is a little secluded, which was what we wanted. Our little oasis. The perfect spot if you want an actual relaxing, worry free vacation. The facilities were excellent. Rooms were clean. Staff was friendly, attentive, incredibly helpful and hands-on. They definitely will go the extra mile for you. The restaurant on site is absolutely marvellous. We had our dinner there and everything is worth every penny. Don’t hesitate to splurge on yourself. The free breakfast was also to die for. So make sure to get the free breakfast deal and take time in indulging yourself with their mouth-watering delicacies. The only thing I regret is not staying longer. I will definitely come back and stay longer next time. You won’t go wrong in booking with Kalapa."
Stayed 3 nights here with my wife. Located In the center of seminyak and canggu. Staffs were all friendly and helpful. U will get all the peace and nature feel in this hotel. They even offer free yoga classes daily. Was rather dark at night while walking back from hotel lobby to your villa. If would be great to upgrade some of the furniture or decor as is starting to age.
"It was a wonderful experience for living in Kalapa Resort. Good service, delicious food, spacious pool and garden, and kind staffs."
"Brilliant place, didn’t disappoint.  Tried yoga daily which we loved the instructor and class.  The rooms are rustic but spacious and clean.   The owners are friendly, informative and happy to assist with any questions.
Staff always smiling and professional.  Loved our stay and would highly recommend to anyone looking for r&r."
"This resort is absolutely beautiful and it's not an ordinary resort. Every room or 'villa' is different. each of these structures have been relocated from different parts of Indonesia and re-built in this resort, other typical Indonesian items have been added which gives this place a very unique and authentic atmosphere. They have 2 beautiful pool with different shaded daybeds, and an open restaurant as common facilities.
What a beautiful place, with wonderful gardens, very friendly staff and service is just exceptional!"
"Travelling with an 8 month old baby is hard but staying here we really felt welcome, and the staff were so helpful with our annoying requests and with baby sitting. When we asked about a room change due to loud noises outside we were immediately accommodated which was incredible. I note a lot of negative reviews with regards to construction work going on. Get over it I say...they are only working daylight hours and are very quiet - almost none of the Rooms are directly affected. 
We will come back and I strongly recommend visiting this resort if only to meet the lovely people who work here. We even met the owner who was a local and loved holding the baby as well!
Terima Kasih!"
"Whilst there was some construction noise it wasn’t so bad if you request a room towards the back (we had room 10).
The real delight was the YOGI’s - Budi and Danielja who were encouraging and most helpful particularly in some of the poses I found challenging. Even though I started Yoga 4 months ago I didn’t feel a novice.
Being VEGAN the cooks treated us to plentiful tasteful options. The pools are spotless and housekeeping first class. Miss Wendy at reception was lovely, warm and accommodating. Highly recommend this property, regards Owen & Julie"
"Spend my last day in this beautiful resort. It was a fantastic day, Yoga class in the morning made everything perfect. The teacher was really patient and nice since I am a beginner. The service was great. The vegetarian breakfast was delicious. I would definitely return."
"I’m not usually a picky traveler, but I was disappointed with this resort. It has potential, but right now there is a big construction project going on right in the middle of the property, with work and noise every day from 7:30am to late afternoon. Expect noise, construction workers everywhere and views obstructed by the project. 

My original room was quite close to the works. I asked to switch due to the noise and the cigarette smoke from the construction workers. The staff gave me a different room that was fine except that the bathtub was broken. 

The staff were helpful and friendly, and the rooms are thoughtfully decorated, but there are so many beautiful places to stay in Bali that there’s no need to pick somewhere in the middle of a construction zone."
I cannot say enough wonderful things about this villa the location was away from the hustle and bustle of canguu the room was spectacular and the breakfast oh my heavens!!! It was a perfect stay ! Tried the yoga class it was wonderful and the massage on site was one of the best I ever had( a little pricey but oh so worth it) The bed was super comfortable and we didn't want to leave! Next time in canguu will definelty be Styaing there again!
"Really enjoyed the stay here. Great room, lovely pools and daily yoga. The food in the restaurant was the best I’ve had in Bali so far."
"We ended up our travel in Bali here. This was the most unforgettable experience to stay in a beautiful wooden house and swim in pool under the stars. Rice field and river surrounded all the resorts. Loved every second, We spend here. Very recommended for those who look for quite, peacefull, and romantic escape."
"If you like to go ethnic, local, cosy,  and close to nature.;This is the place to be in Canggu! Strategically located between the 2 main roads, Batu Belig en Batu Bolong. Close to the hippest pla es to be... 
At the moment there is a construction going on but it will not spoil your fun! Will definitely come back in the future.. :)"
"Great place to stay with a relaxing atmosphere. Tried a yoga class in the morning, what a wonderful experience. Love the room design, very distinctive. I wish I stay a longer time. Will be back"
"We stayed 2 nights and everything was perfect. The rooms are surrounded  by rice fields and a beautiful greenery, the pools are just amazing and the staff is great, helpful and sweet.
It is a perfect spot were to relax and enjoy Bali, we loved everything from the food to the service. It is understated luxury well studied into details.
Highly recommended, I just would love to go back :) We felt at home in a paradise."
Stayed here 2 nights in the villa over a weekend. It was great that the hotel provides shuttle service towards the beach since the location is slightly far away from the main Canggu streets.
Great place to stay. Away from the hustle and bustle of the main area of Canggu. The rooms are large and clean. Pools are fabulous. Would stay again.
This place is beautiful surrounded by nature with wonderful staffs really kind. Yoga are amazing and the food in restaurant is great especially the  fish bumbu kuning so delicious
"Room hygiene is poor. Unfresh bed sheet, pillow cases, duvet cover…  Towels are old and torn. Air conditioning is weak. Food at hotel’s only restaurant is terrible…"
Great room with open air bathroom. Dont miss out their breakfast! Super super super good :)
"I booked this resort for 3 ladies , one with a medical condition that makes it difficult to use stairs or walk far. Upon checking in we could see that this hotel Waa not suitable for people with disabilities and aged persons. The grounds are full of loose pebbles,  steep stairs with broken tiles and slippery steps that lead to the rooms. The driveway is all torn up and is in desperate need of repair. Whilst I was at the resort I witnessed a lady trip and almost tumble down some grass covered steps and a small child slip and fall down the driveway.  Due to all these factors we could not stay at the resort."
"The whole stay was ok. The room is clean and spacious when we checked in late in the night. The staff are very kind and accommodating, always smiling! The room has a very unique layout and can truly feel the Bali vibe. The only con is the door towards the bath is not sealed so the aircon cannot be contained in the room. But apart from that it's all good! Love our bath time in our private outdoor tub!"
"If you really want to be out of town, just to have the ‘me’ or ‘we’ time, then it would be a perfect plc for you, otherwise might not be a good option. The plc is far from everything except a small convenience shop operates till 11ish pm. The staff were very nice during my stay and food portion was big too. 
The only things that they need to improve is to change the pillows to a better and quality ones plus the tv channel access. I found different rooms would have different tv channels, and really weird."
"We really wish we could stay longer. It’s a small resort so very quiet and feels private.  We stayed in the luxury villa and was in awe with the beautiful furniture in the room and throughout the resort. The design is so well-put together. It’s so nice to  be engulfed in lush greenery and wake up to the sound of birds, crickets, and frogs. Just make sure to bring bug spray. :) They also have a cute restaurant with good food. The staff are so helpful and welcoming. Best place for a quiet, relaxing stay. Not a place if you are looking to party."
Tranquil & private place after canggu hectic-ness
enjoyed the yoga retreat during our stayed for 2 nights! Will come back soon
"Kalapa was a welcomed retreat a little outside the noise and busyness of Canggu centre. Because of the distance from Canggu Centre, a short 5 min taxi ride, it may have been nice to have a free shuttle to town throughout the day. Too hot and too much traffic to walk! Only Because this is on offer at other hotels. 
We had the private pool villa and the pool was very cool due to being well shaded. Loved having a TV and access to Netflix. Very comfy room! Great service to our door when we ordered food in. Nice swimming pools which were warmer. Exceptionally lovely staff!
The only downside was the restaurant food. Had fully cooked eggs for Eggs Benedict and boiled ribs for $300k with just BBQ sauce added. The very simple things were done well though. 
7/10, I did love my time here"
"The actual room looks so different from the ones in the photos. In the photos it looks so big, spacious and spotless. In reality, the room isn't the big. The canopy has stains and holes and would guess that it was never washed since it was placed there. The room and dusty and dark as well. Whenever we asked for pool towels, they'd give us towels that have stains and looks dirty. We love the nature vibe but I wasn't able to sleep because the frogs and crickets and other animals are super loud especially at night, so I wouldn't recommend this if you are a light-sleeper. Breakfast is good tho, they have good selection and they're healthy and tasty as well."
"Good resort, we had the biggest room… stuff was very helpfull"
very nice
"Heres why:
1 . Upon Arrival - the lady at the front desk and the staff wasnt accomodating and welcoming.  Checking in was quick gave us the details of the resort and room. Didnt really helped us with our luggage from the shuttle.
2. Going to the room - felt like they shouldnt have helped us with our luggage. Upon entering the room it looked great! But when we settled in. It felt dusty, the curtain and the mosquito bed net was dirty you can tell it wasnt washed for a long time. The bathroom trash can was a water bucket. They didnt provide room slippers unless requested. And oh! The mosquito repellant they brag when we entered was EMPTY."
The staff always have great smiles.  I'm staying somehow  I recommend.  There were a few bugs on this stay.
"We loved our stay, most of the staff was very helpful and friendly. A very nice place to recharge in the middle of the crazy Canggu. Lots of choices for the breakfast, very nice yoga classes. Good to know: the place is located near the road, so you'll hear lots of noises. Also the bathroom is outside, which was ok for us, but expect some visitors from the jungle world."
"If you like a nature feel and rilexs, you can check in here. But need to familiarise with all the cockroaches and mosquitoes. But overall is good to stay."
"This is a great spot, a little further out of main Canggu but easy to get to. So tranquil and great staff."
The place is so relaxing and a vibe
"Beautiful resort and outstanding staff. 
We had a premium bungalow and it was very lovely. Great value for money. 
It is very quiet and surrounded by greenery, feels like being in Ubud but only 5 minutes from the beach. Highly recommend."
What a wonderful place to stay at. Beautiful surroundings and a great room with a bathroom outside which is quite the experience. I enjoyed my stay and took part in daily Yoga classes. Breakfast was outstanding. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This place is great if you need a break everything and just want to chill and relax. A would definitely recommend this place and will return to it in the future.
"One of the best rooms available, and the best staff is really very good.. thanks to their hospitality. A much recommended place."
It’s perfect for couple if you don’t mind mosquito.
