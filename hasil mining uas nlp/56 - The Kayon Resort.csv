"The Resort did a superb hospitality service from welcoming to sending us back home. Welcoming blessing, the punctuality, the speeds for making up the room, the cleaness, we are happy and having a great experience here. While enjoying our stay in nature just be real and accepting some insects or sounds of animals surround our stay. The food breakfast, tea time,room service was good and representable. Thank you Pingky FO staff who was very nice and informative to us."
"This hotel is probably the most unique hotel we've been. I don't think there's another one that you could get the same experience anywhere else in the world. We stayed at a river suite and through the sounds we heard, we felt that we were inside the jungle. The breakfast was fascinating, but the cocktails were okay. You could also have better ala carte food outside, but we never had a specialty dinner. However, these are minor things in this beautiful hotel. The staff was very friendly, and we also had a chance at the spa,  which was amazing too. We had a packed schedule and sadly we couldn't do the morning yoga, but I'd bet that it would be a very unique experience as well."
"I love staying at kayon resort, the staff is very friendly, food is delicious, the environment is nice with view river from our balcony room. We stayed for new year eve and join the gala dinner for new year eve. Thank you for Kayon Resort."
"We can’t say thank you enough for all of the staff at Kayon, who made our honeymoon most unforgettable! We arrived at the hotel on New Year’s Eve and stayed for 7 nights. The hotel prepared an amazing NYE party on site,  including cocktail hour, dinner course with traditional Balinese dance show. My husband had not been feeling well prior to the arrival, and we informed the staff that he would not be able to eat the dinner course. They were very kind and caring, and served him a special ginger tea. They said it’s a “magic tea”, and sure enough, it really worked! We’ve stayed many beautiful hotels around the world, but by far, no other place is as lovely as Kayon. We loved the delicious breakfast and stunning view from the hotel, but the most valuable experience was getting to know the staff at Kayon. Everyone stopped and greeted us with a beautiful smile on their face. Not only the hotel, but the people at the Kayon make the hotel truly a magical place! Suksama!"
"Best experience, all staff were so friendly and helpful, 101% recommendations!!"
"It’s been forever since i made my last review on Agoda but i remind myself to make this one hoping one way or another the resort management know they already have the best staffs.  The property is not brand new but is well maintained. I was looking for secluded-quiet resort with jungle vibes. They gave me a villa with waterfall view from my balcony, what more can i ask.  The resort is definitely a choice a traveller should consider. Hospitality  is never out of fashion !"
"Truly the best Balinese stay experience in Ubud. The reception staff were excellent, they helped us with various other needs such as bike rental, within no time. Sang Ade, Astiti and others went beyond their call of duty to help up. Check In and Check Out experience was also very smooth."
"So grateful to have found this hotel. The staff, from the reception restaurant drivers, we’re all so incredibly kind. They made me feel like I was truly on a vacation and made my first time in Bali so special. Thank you so much! 🙏💕💕💕"
"Kami datang lebih awal sekitar jam 11 pdhl cek in tine jam 4 sore, tp kami dibantu utk early cek in (terima kasih the Kayon!). Fasilitas excellent!. Stafnya sangat ramah. Room interior dll are satiesfied and outstanding!. Overall, kami puas dgn semua yg ada di the Kayon Resort. We will be back when we come back to Bali. Thanks the Kayon Resort!, all the best!"
"Staff is amazing, food amazing and location is also really good. 5 star service at its finest."
"Luxury and tranquil atmosphere, you can sleep with door open listening to the sound of the water from the waterfall around the hotel !!!! Love it"
We had a wonderful stay at the Kayon Resort. We could not have been more welcomed by the staff - every detail had been thought of and accomodated. The bedroom was beautiful and the bathroom was stunning! The spa was lovely and we enjoyed a free 10 minute welcome massage. Food and balinese dancing was a real highlight. Pool was beautiful and much calmer than the Kayon Jungle Resort. Also a better location for Ubud. I would highly recommend!
"One of the best resorts to just chill and recharge. The staff are amazing, from the moment we arrived until we departed, they were all hospitable and consistently fast in serving us., The villa with a pool was amazing, we had lots of privacy and since ours was closest to the jetty, the sound of waterfalls can be heard all throughout the villa. We felt we are in the midst of lush nature. It’s my second time coming to Kayon and it’s one of the places I long to be in when I’m not in Ubud. The mountain, the resort and the service are just impeccable. P.S. Thank you to the GM Leon who came down to talk to us, after knowing I’m a repeat customer. We’ll definitely be back again!"
great time spent lovely staff always smiling and competent👍😘
"-Exceptional service and experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
-Booked a villa with private pool which was decorated by the staff perfectly
-The resort offered additional experiences like photo session and morning walk which upped the experience
-Staff 101% polite, kind, helpful 
-Got a special gift for my baby from the resort as well ❤️"
"This is a beautiful hotel in Ubud with very attentive and kind staff. Before staying at the hotel, I had multiple questions for them via Agoda and all of them were answered promptly. The toilet is also fantastic with a big bathtub. The hotel breakfast is delicious. The only downside is that the road to the hotel can be quite tricky to drive so I recommend getting a cab to access the hotel. It is definitely not walkable."
Stayed for four nights. Staff a credit to the hotel. Upon checking in which was faultless and a nice experience the room greeted us with a fusty smell. They attempted to address with a humidifier but it didn't work and so moved rooms the next day which had an electronic air freshener on the wall which masked any smells. Visited the Kayon jungle resort and the pool there was superb and is definitely worth visiting using the free shuttle provided. Would recommend this hotel when staying in Ubud
"The Kayon was easily our favorite place in Bali. The staff are extremely accommodating and a pleasure to talk to. They set up a special birthday surprise and brought me cake for breakfast. It made the day very special. 
The facilities are also amazing, you feel tucked away in the jungle with an amazing infinity pool and bathrooms that are built for relaxation!"
"I had a pool villa, nested in the middle of the forest. Beautifully appointed, the sounds of nature. The staff was attentif, helpful and friendly. Great escape from the busy word."
One of the best resort hotel in Ubud. The staffs are awesome. Very good services to guest. Well done and keep up the good work!
"All the staff were kind, and the room was so beautiful. and, food is delicious. LoVe"
"thanks the super friendly staffs who met our needs, we got the best ubud experience ever! love the waterfall. love the room. love the overall resort vibes. would love to come back!!!"
Lovely hotel. Very comfortable. 5 minute drive to Ubud central activities. Room was really good. Staff very friendly. Would definitely stay again
"We have nothing bad to say about this place. The facilities, the food, the staff - everything is great. Perfect if you enjoy luxury and calmness. They always do the extra small stuff that makes a stay even more amazing, and I just cannot stress how good the service is! A must stay when in Ubud."
"This is one of the BEST accommodation in Bali! Worth the money 🌟
Excellent staff service!!! Free yoga class in the morning is a plus! And they do serve generous servings of delicious meals that you will not be able to resist! 😅
Will definitely recommend this place to my family and friends ♥️"
"I highly recommend the Kayon experience. It was a pleasure to stay here. The staff was amazing, the food was delicious, the ambience is perfect & the sound of the waterfall is contagious. It is the dream destination for a getaway in Ubud. We also received a complimentary room decoration which was wonderful."
"We loved The Kayon!! From the airport pickup, first impression of the resort as we arrived, checkin and our welcome drink and snack... we were already incredibly impressed upon arrival, which continued throughout our stay. We stayed in a river suite and it was very romantic. But the entire property is gorgeous. I think the biggest highlight though, was the food. The quality of the food admittedly, was unexpected. We ate dinner at the restaurant after we arrived and were very impressed. The breakfast the next morning though, was next level. With a choice of about five different menus ranging from traditional Indonesian through to an ‘American breakfast’, each came with between 3-5 courses! The coffee was good, the juices were excellent. I think I would have to say it’s the best included hotel breakfast I’ve ever had. (Don’t be boring, try some of the Indonesian options... I highly recommend the Indonesian rice pudding and chicken porridge ;) ;)).
Thanks for an amazing stay."
Nice place to stay
Outstanding property with an amazing staff who take care of every detail! It almost felt like an all inclusive resort because of the activities available! The morning breakfast has lots of options and is delicious!
I love how the staff are genuinely caring about us.  From friendly greeting and smile whenever they see us to waiting for us till we get back to the hotel before they left for home as we have engaged the free transport service to ubud centre and they were afraid we have no means of getting back to the hotel. Really really appreciate their thoughts
Great Resort for couple.. U can feel the nature around.
"This resort is highly recommended for those who want some serenity and tranqulity of Bali.
It is situated in a beautiful setting and has its own natural waterfalls.
A complimentary floating breakfast is available for guests who stay in the river edge pool vila.
Staffs were attentive and the service was great.
The place itself is stunning and I can't really recommend this place enough as your accommodation in Ubud."
"The location is great. The services and the staff were stunning. They are super helpful kind, skilled, and lovely, Thank you Yudi and everyone."
"We enjoyed our stay at The Kayon.  The restaurant serves delicious breakfast, high tea and dinner.  Especially enjoyed the dinner that had Balinese dance performance on the Thursday we checked in.  Easy to book transport to go Ubud centre and most of all - to a nearby village and rice terraces.  The staff there are exceptionally friendly and helpful."
"The staffs are super friendly,  room is very clean, the environment is so relaxing. Will definitely be back"
Lovely little getaway with my partner. Staff are amazing.
"Love the place. It's so fit for couple. Location is around 10 mins from Ubud's center.
Breakfast is good.
Staff always greet us, attentive and helpful.
Recommended to spend your time here."
Best resort
"Everything is good, staff, hotel, meal, etc.
I will also stay on my next visit."
"From 7am till end of the day, you can stay in the hotel and enjoy their activates. They also have shuttle bus to Ubud center."
Very romantic & refreshments place!
Excellent all around. Thank you to an amazing and attentive staff.
"Our second visit, a relaxing stop over on the way back to the UK from New Zealand. It is a long drive from the airport, takes almost 2 hours depending on traffic, but the hotel transfer is excellent. The hotel is built on a hill side so plenty of steps and no lift, but not a problem even at 70+. Lovely pool area, the staff are wonderful, so well trained and from the local area. Regular shuttle into Ubud is great, we love the cheap curios especially on the road before the centre. The restaurant service can be a little slow."
rekomennn banget....
It's a hotel with soul n unique feel. Really worth to stay here for for experience
"I stayed in the River Edge Pool Villa and was upgraded to stay another night there from my original booking. 
The villa that I got, which was Villa 5, was simply great. It overlooks the jungle, waterfall and river. I can see and hear all of them from my bedroom and bathroom! Simply an oasis and a spectacular view. 
Here, you can also find a private infinity pool facing all elements I've just mentioned above: the jungle, waterfall, and river!
I totally enjoyed my stay in this villa as I love nature so much. The sound of both the slow stream river afar and the waterfall was just soothing and relaxing. To wake up in the morning and see trees from all corners of your bedroom is glorious. Not to mention, if you take a bath, your eyes are also pampered by the view of the trees. 
Its elegant interior makes the whole experience  nicer. 
The room for improvement would be the maintenance of the interior and the service of the restaurant. 
I could see big stains on the ceiling of my bed veil, the bathtub knob was broken, and the shower knob to let the big shower head runs was also not working. The hot water took a long time to be hot. The gate doors were a bit jammed and needed quite a push to perfectly close them.  And the pool was a bit dirty, you could see some dirts and a handful of dry leaves on its floor. 
The restaurants could improve their service. I booked a table at the jetty for an early dinner at 4:30, I got there on time and there wasn't anyone attending. After I complained to the receptionist, the restaurant called me to my villa but was being somehow defensive saying that the table would usually be set up last minute, as well as the waiter to attend the restaurant. It doesn't make sense. Usually, restaurants have already have the reserved tables set at least 30 minutes before the reservation time. 
The waiter didn't know well the menu. He needed to go back and forth the kitchen and me to get the explanations right. I believe more trainings are advisable"
"An amazing retreat that delivers exactly what's promised, romance and couples time with excellent food and attentive service"
"Here is my honest opinion... I thought the staff were amazing, so so friendly and helpful, some of the nicest people I have met! BUT for the price we paid per night there was nothing special about the resort, although really beautiful nothing stood out more than the other smaller accommodations we had.
Example: we got married on one of the days and there was nothing special planned or any sweet gesture etc but when we stayed at another small/way cheaper resort right after they heard that we got married 2days before and they set up a stunning private dinner, flowers and a sweet honeymoon dessert for FREE. And the price between the two resorts was more than a $100s... So besides from the friendly staff, beautiful location I just didn't feel like I got my money's worth to be honest.. :("
Frendly staff
"It was great to stay here for a couple days , because the place is so nature and make me felt so relax. And also the staf is really friendly and helpfull , Super love !! ill come back soon 🥳"
Clear.enjoy.nice view.
"This is the place to relax.. 
The fried banana is sooo yummyyy"
"A quiet, private place with the world famous Bali hospitality. Attentive and friendly staff."
Beautiful resort in jungle would recommend a pool suite
"Was glad they upgraded my room to Suite
Room overlooks a flowing river. Staff were polite and nice... nothing short of the Balinese hospitality .. however, one thing I was a bit disappointed. The gym facilities is situated within the same space as business room. It was like an afterthought. otherwise, all was great from check-in till checkout."
Best for honeymoon and healing
"A peacefuo and beautiful please, rooms were great, staff attentive. Restaurant could be better."
"Nyaman banget ,"
"We had a pleasant stay at the Kayon, but felt that other resorts we had stayed at in the area were much better value for money, more modern and ultimately had better facilities. I think the rooms could do with being updated and the overall feel of the resort wasn't 5 star in comparison to other alternative options on the island of Bali."
good for honeymoon
"We stayed this hotel for one night because they can’t allow us to check-out on 31 Dec, 2022. When we went to the room after check-in, it smells mold in all over the room. We said that this rooms is fully humid and it’s able to stay in that room. The staff said they are almost fully booked, so he told us he will check it.  After he checked, he showed another one which is more humid room(I really DON’T GET IT why he showed worse room than the one they gave.  A room could be humid because this hotel is in the jungle, but I can’t believe how they didn’t maintain rooms like the other hotels we stayed in Ubud. Any hotels provided the worst room before, and I didn’t think I can’t sleep in the smelly room. 
So I asked to talk to GM, and the operation manager showed up. I explained the room is too smelly and humid, so we want to change a room. He said we JUST stay ONLY one night, so there is no option except for another room which is more smelly and humid. How the hotel manager told a guest that we need to stay that unbelievable smelly and moldy room as we stayed only one night? We paid more than $300 to stay there!!!!!
I can’t believe this hotel is 5 stars and that ARROGANT guy is a operation manager. 
I want to 100% refund the one night stay fee because that stay was the worst experience with that shitty treatment by the hotel."
"Extremely humit and a lot of mold in bath room..
Staffs were very friendly and helpful but thats pretty much it."
"Resort is too small, not many thing to do in Hotel
Food is far from our expection, need to be more improved."
No way close to five star or luxury standard.
"Having been to Ubud a few times, we knew what we are looking for when picking somewhere to stay in that area. I am really happy to say Kayon resort is much more than we expected, from the moment we checked in we knew we have made the right choice. This place is so beautiful!
We were greeted by very friendly staffs, welcome drinks and afternoon refreshments. Because we were celebrating our anniversary, our room and the very spacious bath were beautifully decorated with flowers. They run hourly shuttle buses to Ubud centre until late which is very convenient if you want to dine out as there are many fine quality restaurants in the area. 
The breakfast menu is fantastic and it is four courses! I recommended trying the Indonesian style breakfasts they are a great way to sample local food which are cooked and presented to perfection, its like fine-dining for breakfast. They also have healthier options with gluten free bread and egg white scramble which are also very good. 
There are plenty of activities at the resort, nothing beats doing yoga in the morning breathing in the fresh air overlooking the beautiful scenery. The 90 minutes morning guided walk is a great way to visit the village, scroll through the rice field and meet some local people. We have also tried the couple spa package at their spa, which is very relaxing with the sound of the river as the backdrop. Not to mention the beautiful pool.
On one night we booked the romantic candle night dinner. I think they are better at cooking Asian style dinner than western style food. Nevertheless the whole dinner experience was still very good as the atmosphere was so romantic and private.
I highly recommended this hotel and will stay again when I next travel to Ubud. While there are many nice resorts there, I think its forest location, attentiveness of the staff and the personalised experience made Kayon stands out from the crowd.
Room Tip: upper level rooms if you don't like the humidity"
"I travel for adventure, my husband travels to relax. Travel within a budget is my mantra, obviously hubby is the opposite -- shut up and take my money kind of guy. To compromise, our getaways consists usually of a one night luxury stay.
What I learned in Bali -- you get what you paid for.
That's for a different story, and Kayon resort is the good part.
We love Kayon resort! It makes me rethink my position. Me and  hubby are two spoiled kids in paradise. Yes, it is expensive but with the service and everything.. And i mean everything -- the view, the pool, the facilities, the room, the food, the tour, the people.. All worth it. They even sang and gave me a birthday cake! :)
For a backpacker like me, i would splurge my budget in Kayon once we go back to Ubud. It is an experience by itself. See you again!"
"The Kayon Resort is beautiful, and they really take care of their guests!  The price is totally worth it, I highly recommend this hotel.  Food is amazing!  Breakfast is huge and nice quality, you don't have to worry about not having enough to eat.  My husband and I tried almost all the asian dishes on the menu and they're all delicious, especially the ribs and the curries!  Staff are very friendly and super helpful.  Rooms are beautiful, huge tub.  The free shuttle to town is really useful.  We even took a day tour with a driver from the resort and it's really nice too!  It's just a really relaxing and quality place.  Best choice for staying in Ubud.   One thing to note is the River Suite we got a free upgrade to is really humid inside.  But I don't think there's much the resort can do about it, since the room is right by the river.  So if you don't really humid room, don't go with the river suites.  Another thing is the spa has room to improve.  My husband and I got a couples spa package.  It was pricy, but the massage wasn't great, and the scrub wasn't a very enjoyable experience since it's super scratchy.  The process felt very hurried.  But other than that, we really can't find any fault is this place.  You feel like you're in paradise when you're here, and in compareson to some other places we've stayed in on the trip, it really is paradise."

"I have been so many times to Bali and Ubud, but I am truly amazed. This from far my best stay in Ubud. I truly felt in holidays. The hotel has a lot of charm in the middle of the nature and bordering a river, it is a Mix of Jungle Resort and Spa and Hanging Garden. But the owner paid attention to the details to build not only a hotel but carved the history and mythology of Kayon into the rock. The staff is very friendly and do the maximum to arrange your stay as best as they can. Very relaxing place, the spa is very good as well. Internet is incredibly fast, you can even watch video in streaming, thing which is not very common in Ubud area. For people who still have unexpected work, this is a very pleasant guarantee. Last but not least, the food is truly truly good. The chef previously for Aman Resort in Nusa Dua. All which is in the menu is very good. THe difference between good chef and normal chef, is that the good one can make you like what you usually do not like, and this chef is of that kind. Each dish is an impressive and surprising mix of flavors that have not only been mastered to bring the best of each flavor but also to give curative effects. If there was only one negative point, it would be the door of the rooms that let the possibility to people outside to see slighty what is happening inside. If you have a special moment with your partner, it might not be that private. But this is a small detail. For people who seek hotels with charm, peace of mind, spirituality and comfort, do not seek any further, this place is out of the charts. Moreover the staff does not try to charge you the every small detail like many hotels have become so enclined to do, which leaves a very bad taste to your holidays. Truly amazing"
"We really enjoyed our stay here for 4 days. After staying by the beach in Jimbaran, we wanted to stay in a beautiful scenic hotel in Ubud And Kayon Resort fit that completely. The hotel is next to a waterfall so you wake up and go to sleep listening to the sounds of the waterfall and birds. The swimming pool is great and looks onto the beautiful lush greenery, the restaurant served good breakfasts and great dinners. Our favourite was the Balinese chicken curry and red prawn curry. The crowning jewel of Kayon Resort however is the staff. Every single person here from the security guard, check-in staff, cleaners & manager and staff at the restaurant go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. They even remember little things that you mention and try to assist each guest personally. All the staff are so kind, genuine and you could really feel that they care. We will come here again next year and stay for longer."
"My wife and I split our vacation in Bali.  We spent 4 nights in Nusa Dua and 3 nights at The Kayon Resort in Ubud.  By far, we enjoyed our stay at The Kayon Resort better than our stay in Nusa Dua.  The resort is build on a cliff and small enough to be intimate.  We loved the feel of the resort and the staff are the nicest and best staff we have experienced in a hotel stay.  They are so sincerely nice and accommodating that we were blown away.  We vacation alot and own a vacation rental business, yet I can sincerely say this was one of our best vacation experiences ever!"
"Three nights at this beautiful resort was definitely not enough. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we felt truly pampered at The Kayon Resort. The staff went out of their way to ensure everything was exceeding our expectations, from the food to the activities. to the facilities. The rooms are spacious with stunning views of the river and/or valley (depending on which you book). The infinity pool is the perfect place to unwind after a day of exploring the surrounding area or even Ubud town. I would recommend The Kayon Resort to anyone looking for a piece of paradise during their stay in Ubud."
"We stayed at Kayon resort for 3 nights in March. From my room River view suite, you can see the waterfall.   
The river sound is the only thing you can hear. Hotel staff are  trying so hard to make the customers comfortable. They are so lovely. 
During the stay, I had my birthday then they brought me a surprise cake at the breakfast. so lovely. 
There are only 22 rooms and all the staff are treat you like a family member. What a lovely experience.
Also the restaurant is very recommending. High quality and great service. Much better value than the food in Ubud center. (if you want to have a good romantic dinner) 
They opened other hotel Kayon Jungle Resort which is a bit farther from center and I heard it is very nice too. Don't get confused!!!"
"My husband and I decided to have a quick getaway in Ubud and we chose Kayon resort because of the good reviews. We were looking for a place to relax and to just enjoy the nature. When we arrived, we felt the warm welcome of the staffs especially the resort manager, Gede. We also loved the welcome drink! The food were so good as well and the restaurant manager, Hery, was very accomodating. I also tried their traditional balinese massage which is a bit pricey but it’s worth it! But the main reason why I love this resort is the people. All the staffs are genuinely nice and friendly. I don’t normally write reviews but I just want to share my experience to others. Overall, I recommend the resort to all the couples and even for solo traveller."
"Loved this property, it's sooo beautiful. We had a river view and you could hear it everywhere, which was really soothing. The property and rooms are really well kept and clean. The staff really cares that you have a great experience and are warm and welcoming.  I love loved the tea time by the waterfall. The location is a little out of the way, it's not in Ubud proper, but cabs and shuttles to their other property are easy to get. I also love that they have cultural activities to do!! BE SURE YOU DON""T BOOK THE WRONG KAYON. There's Kayon jungle and Kayon river. Both beautiful, this one's more quaint. My only gripes: The yoga class, it was very slow and basically just stretching (but it was free so can I really complain??) and the food. The food was just ok. We did breakfast (which was very generously portioned for a free meal) and dinner a couple times and both are just meh. Also I would have appreciated a couple of more wine by the glass options. But these things are sooo nit-picky."
"This secluded, romantic & unique resort is 1st class in every way... The staff is amazing, the food is remarkable and the ammenities & activities are perfect! They do it all here and theu do it well. I
We plan on recomensing to all friends honwymooning or travwling to Bali. You must experience Ubud as well as the coastlines. Make sure the Ubud visit is complimented & enabled by the staff at Kayon resort. Lovely..."
"The Kayon Resort has left us speechless. Words won’t ever do justice for the service and hospitality of all Kayon staff. Thought had been put into ensuring the stay at the Kayon is exceptional from the minute you arrive. Staff remember your name, make you feel at home and ensure you have a truly remarkable and memorable experience. We have just arrived home and still feel special with an email making sure we arrived home safely and our welcome photo attached. Every meal was perfect, our room was always made - and our bed was even turned down for us of an evening. We have stayed at some great places around the world but The Kayon is one place we will remember - it stand and out above the rest! We will be back! Incredible grateful xx"
"We are extremely satisfied with our 2 night stay at the river suite at Kayon Resort. We like the serenity of this resort and the soothing sound of the river. The bed and pillow are very comfortable. We enjoy the breakfast, which are of high quality and standard. The staff at the resort are very friendly, always smiling and helpful. The complimentary shuttle service to the Ubud town operates till 9pm in the evening, which is fantastic, a definite plus point! The yoga class and walking tour in the morning are an added value   provided by the resort. Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back again."
"I am embarrassed to see that I missed reviewing the Kayon last year when I stayed there. For anyone looking for a relaxing, luxurious retreat in Bali, you cannot go past the Kayon. Clean. Impeccable service. Attention to detail. Nothing is missing from this resort. Yes. It is a little pricier than most feel appropriate for Bali, but it is, without a doubt, worth every penny. This is a must to stay at. I found myself googling 'squatters rights in Bali' ... without much success :( Thank you staff and management at The Kayon for such a beautiful stay."
"We stayed in Kayon for a short duration but the hospitality and the service of staff was really amazing. We had been to multiple resorts across the world but for us till not this was the best experience. The entire experience was amazing. The designer/architect of the resort deserve the award. It was so nicely kept and managed by wonderful staff. We loved the most the Jetty area and the fall. I also took the Yoga class and that was also a very nice experience. The overall experience was so nice that I am falling short of the words.
Truly Amazing..Truly Ubud..Truly Bali."
"Everything about the Kayon river resort was perfect. They got every detail right, the location is breath-taking, and the staff warm and friendly.  The resort is small and intimate and we absolutely loved every moment and inch of it.
My partner and I stayed here for our honeymoon for two nights. We also stayed at three other luxury resorts in the area, all of which were more expensive and not as good as Kayon. Book the Kayon, book them for your transfer from the airport using their comfortable shuttle with free wifi, and relax and let them take care of you. They were the best, seriously. The spa, the food, everything.
Thank you to Gede, Kadek, and all the staff at Kayon for making our visit so memorable! We are indebted!"
"Kayon Resort is a perfect place to rest, enjoy the nature and Bali. It's 10-15 minutes driving distance to the ubud center but shuttles are working every hour properly. Rooms, food, activities, infinity pool, everything was perfect. The staff was so kind and friendly. Especially if you are a couple and want to run away from crowd of bali, perfect choise."
"Kayon hotel set back on beautiful hill in Ubud, surrounded by river, waterfall and paddy-fields. It's a beautiful setting, the hotel serve such an excellent breakfast, the best of our 3 weeks stay. The pool was small but still beautiful - you can swim while enjoying your surrounding. The staff was helpful. However this hotel is outside the main part of ubud - there is a shuttle that will take you to ubud, mind you the trip can be varied from 10 min one way trip to 45 min due to traffic. The hotel is catered more for couple, family had to sign an agreement just in case your kids are noisy and disturbing other resident you can be evicted. The hotel have lots of staircase with no elevator facility, so if you are not fond of going up and down the stair, this could be a challenge."
"Absolutely fabulous. I cant sing enough praises of everyone working in the resort to make our stay memorable! There is nothing they would not do, even accompanying me around the resort (when I lost my way)! They even address me by my name! The success of a resort is based on the staff's performance. The Kayon Resort has the best staff working there who takes pride in their work. Can I give them a rating of 6/5? Yes, they truly deserve a 6/5 rating! I gave them all a huge tip because they deserve it and they've worked hard for it! Congrats Kayon Resort"
Strongly recommend this resort mainly  due to their hospitality and services. Lovely and clean rooms with beautiful environment of restaurant and pool side.
One the best hotel in ubud with superb service and room
good
"I booked for one night before leaving Bali, wanted to check out Ubud, the hotel is actually not even in the Ubud district- according to local driver. You are not allowed to call grab or gojek while staying in this hotel but only use the hotel arranged car - which is 40-50% more than grab. And since the hotel is in the middle of no where, you will have to use their car service, the shuttle bus to go to Kayon jungle - their sister hotel is only at 9am, if you plan to go any other time during the day, you will need to pay extra to use their car..! 
The staffs at reception are not helpful at all, won’t even carry your bag….I’m a solo female traveller… restaurant staffs are nice and polite tho. 
Rooms are really small considering Bali average, i spent 20 days in Bali this time. 
Honestly don’t understand how this hotel get rated at 9.4… i won’t even give a 6 …."
We were impressed by how friendly and polite the staff was. They were always ready to exceed our expectations. We had a pleasure experience at Kayon Jungle.
"The staff were very kind and greeted me with a smile.  The breakfast was great, lots of variety, and very sweet."
"I am highly recommend this place.! It is so reasonable price and the staffs are so nice. It also provides free shuttle bus to go to Kayon Jungle resort, so if you need to experience the luxury pool, you could get it as well. 
Only one thing that i was uncomfortable is the location which was quite far from main street. Also, the road which goes to resort is too narrow and up-down hills, so you must be good at driving motorcycle.!"
"Me and my wife stayed in river edge pool villa with waterfall view. This is one of the most premium rooms there, and it completely blew out minds . The sculptures ,furniture ,river edge pool , amazing bathroom with tub and a private dressing area, man this was a dream setting , not seen a 5 star of this level , the best part is the hotel is so green from start till end , the host special nights for honeymoon couple with dance music and cake. The staff , the service , their smiley faces , all was worth it. Kayon is really a special place to be, yes you're spending a lot on this property , but believe me, once you check out , you will keep thinking about this place and compare this with every other place . They left a great impact , we stayed in this property for 2 nights , and spent really less time at the property during day time due to activities around u ubud area, regret little bit, but for travellers out there, budget people should Include this to experience true luxury .
Thank you Kayon!!!"
Stayed for 2 nights in Kayon resort. On the day of arrival was my friend's birthday. We requested for a table at the Canyon near the mini waterfall for lunch. Staffs surprised us with birthday cake for my friend and me too as my birthday was the day before. They even sang us birthday song. After lunch we were surposed to meet up with our driver we arranged but the driver didnt make it. We asked the resprt for help
"The property is just amazing and so is the facilities and staff... What i did wrong was to book pool villa, you see i thought i would be spending time in the villa. But my wife is too scared of insects.... So it was imperative to use it... We went out late morning and come back early evening.... So wasting money on the private pool is not ideal..... Also to mention we enjoyed their main pool a lot more..."
"We are fortunate to have traveled extensively but never have we come across such outstanding service!  Every single staff member called us by name, were friendly, tentative and genuinely interested in our comfort at all times.  They could not do enough for us.  The rooms were large, clean and very comfortable with stunning views.  The resort facilities were spotless and the restaurant meals were outstanding without the price tag. Cant recommend this place to couples highly enough. Not suitable for anyone who cant manage a lot of stairs as there are no lifts and the resort is on a number of levels."
"We love The Kayon Resort! The moment that you walk in their resort, you feel at ease. The staff provides excellent service from the time you check in until you check out. They make you feel very warm and at home. The food is amazing! The chef is very considerate and allows their guests to make special requests when it comes to food. The rooms and facilities are clean and well maintained. Definitely a place worth coming back for!"
The staff go above and beyond to meet your every need. Breakfast menu is awesome but ordered a lot off the menu stuff and was never a problem!! Highly recommend! We will definitely be back. Also love that they train the local younger community in the hospitality industry for better job prospects.
"Best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. The staff was incredible - they really make every guest feel welcomed!
Amazing infinity pool, as well as view next to waterfall.
The rooms are also perfect!"
"We’ll definitely be back!!! 💕
Everything about Kayon is so lovely.. From the Staff, the Villa, the Food, the service are all awesome. The moment we reach the hotel you can feel the warm welcome of the staff.  The dinner at the restaurant & the floating breakfast are so lovely & awesome!!! We definitely recommend kayon hotel specially for a couple who want to relax."
My husband and I enjoyed the stay at the Kayon hotel so much. Hotel was very clean and staff was so friendly. we enjoyed the morning yoga and walk :)
"From the moment we got there we were treated with the most upmost respect. We felt welcomed and at home immediately. Even though we only stayed for two nights, The Kayon Resort left us wanting to stay longer! Every single staff member attended to our needs no matter the time or circumstance. The food and Spa service was also superb! An unforgettable stay, all thanks to the people whom work there. We will definitely be back soon. Thank you all so much."
Their breakfast selections are 5 star quality and most generous.Their resort is maintained to the highest standards.The staff is the finest that we have ever encountered and we have traveled world wide.Make sure you visit their new sister resort ...They will provide a complimentary shuttle to the resort....The 3 infinity pools with long range views are extra ordinary.Eventhough the new facility is more grandiose we found the hospitality at the Pramana facility to be far more superior.
We stayed here to try it after a recommendation from a friend and we really liked it. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and service was great. We got a riverside pool villa overlooking the waterfall which was lovely. The room was really nice and big. The pool was lovely although the outside space was a bit small and hard to sunbathe with the limited space and nit much sun between the roof and the high walls. We still loved it and the food was great and cocktails very nice also. They were well priced as well for a hotel. We’d recommend staying here again and would go back ourselves. Far nicer than the Kayon Jungle for a couple.
Staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. They are very attentive and kind. A warm welcome by “Pinky” made us feel at home.
"The staff treats you like family and the service was top notch. Views from our room, the hotel and the restaurants were breathtaking. We saw monkeys from our balcony and heard the waterfall. The food and drinks were delicious and the spa experience was incredible. The staff here will do anything in their power to make your stay more comfortable and enjoyable. They truly go above and beyond to arrange drivers and experiences for you. There is a free shuttle to Ubud and to their sister hotel the Kayon Jungle resort - which has a three tiered pool and view of the rice terraces. We plan to come back for our honeymoon and stay in a villa. Great for couples - romantic and intimate."
"Loved this resort, the staff couldnt have been more attentive or friendly. The resort is amazing, the pool fantastic and the little hidden cafe with the view of the waterfall is stunning. We saw a family of about 20 monkeys making their way over the waterfall which was brilliant.
One watch out is that there are lots of stairs! Fine for us as we're pretty fit, but if you have mobility issues or are older you might struggle with all the stairs."
"I have never experienced a such a wonderful resort despite being so lucky to visit quite a few excellent resorts around the world. The service is the best I have ever had anywhere, and it really has to be experienced to believe. The location is remote in the jungle, but that is kind of the point. You don’t want to leave anyway, but if you do the resort provides hourly shuttle to Ubud town from morning until late evening. 
The room were spotless and very cosy. Nice view of the jungle. 
Only small improvement would be to stop up selling in spa. I was a bit too much. Also the restaurant could improve. The service was amazing of course, but the food was a little bland. Almost is the chef was afraid the guest would find it to spicy. The Indonesian dishes should have a lot of flavor and be spicy."
The resort is perfect. It’s situated in a beautiful nook of Ubud. The staff really sets it apart.
"It was a place where the orots could feel the jungle in Bali.
Is that because it's a small size?  Or is it because there are no members like us? He always smiled and helped us as if he knew us everywhere.
And the dinner was great, and it was more satisfying because it was not a buffet for breakfast.   You reflected a lot in your yoga class in the morning. It was so stiff.
It's an unforgettable time to listen to the birds and the water.   It was time for the Oroot to enjoy me by walking into the middle of nature.  Thank you, all of you.~^^"
Pros - The resort is beautiful and the staff are very friendly. It is very quiet and cosy as they only have around 24 rooms.
We stayed at the kayon resort 4 nights during Aug. The service we received was faultless. The amenities are nice and breakfast was delicious. If you are looking to have an outstanding experience in a resort surrounded by trees and green area I’d highly recommend the Kayon resort.
"Kayon Resort is beautiful.  The staff are so friendly and attentive.  They can't do enough for you.  We stayed in a private villa with pool down in the canyon, set in the jungle, river and waterfall.  Perfection!
Lots of steps to climb up and down to get the villa but worth it!  Food was fantastic.  Highly recommend."
"I’ve never experienced service and an atmosphere like this. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, and you can just spot monkeys in the jungle around you from swimming in the pool. The staff make this place heavenly, making you feel so special and accommodating you for everything. The experience just felt so personal and intimate, and I would come back in a heartbeat."
"It’s one of the best warm service and cozy resorts for the family trip in Bali. Just make us feel like at home. We like yoga and morning walk a lot. And also, I had an unforgettable birthday here. Thanks for the surprising birthday cake, card and cookies. I’d certainly recommend friends to visit this nice resort. :)"
"Wonderful place quiet and tranquil, highly recommended. Staff were fantastic so helpful and friendly. Room was clean, views were amazing"
A fantastic hotel in a great jungle/ river setting. Staff could not be more friendly or wanting to make our stay the best it could be. Would very much recommend to anyone wanting a romantic holiday or just somewhere relaxing and scenic to forget about a busy life.
"Me and my wife has enjoyed the place and mostly the hospitality throughout our stay. Staff are always checking if everything is fine as a way to ensure our stay at the resort is memorable and memorable.
Our room is always clean, thanks to the housekeeping team who works tirelessly in making sure that our rooms are clean.
Kepitu staff are always smiling and friendly. Enjoyed the local meals that was served.
Another bonus is that there is a free shuttle to go to their other resort ""The Kayon Jungle Resort"". Another eye candy location, the larger infinity pool and the surrounding greeneries. Its a must visit place. 
To the front office team headed by Gede, thank you very much for making our stay memorable and wanting to go back.
Overall we will rate is as 11/10, as our stay is filled with wonderful memories and experienced one of the best hospitality."
Nothing is too much trouble. Such lovely staff. Rooms are beautiful. Resort is tranquil
"I recommend everyone. It was perfect trip and accomodation.
Clean and cozy"
"We stay there 3 nights.
It’s was amazing days in Kayon, they let us rent a motor from them to ubud.
The room was amazing!
But the best thing in this hotel is the staff! So warm and kindness"
