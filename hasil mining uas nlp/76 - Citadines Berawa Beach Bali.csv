"It’s like a second or third home.
Staff are welcomed, rooms is clean, facilities is good, location is nice too - what need more? :)
If you looking fog good place to stay and have fun or work - this hotel is great option!"
"booked 2 bedroom suite with living room for 4 pax family traveller, the room was spacious and clean! 1 queen size bed for master room and 2 single beds for second room and 2 toilets. upon checked in, the hotel informed us that it will be noisy during the day (nearby construction) and night (finns beach club and atlas beach club). however based on our 2 nights stay experience, we don’t really affected by it. they have 2 different breakfast style for weekday (western menu) and weekend (buffet) both were delicious!"
"Everything was perfect from location, public service area, customer service and cleanliness. They would give u disclaimer on how the area can get loud till late from early morning till late cos of constructions and Atlas, but we couldnt hear anything at all! it was a really nice stay. will come back next time n stay longer! thank u citadines berawa team"
"The hotel was great (clean and spacious rooms, nice swimming pools, SPA and gym, kind & helpful staff) and location is close to many great spots in Canggu. However I would warn guests who are not aware that several night/beach clubs are also near by and you can hear loud music noise at night."
"I wrote this while im still in my 4 nights stay in Citadine Berawa Hotel.
This hotel is in a perfect spot if you want to just chill out enjoying the beach ambience and some walks to good restaurants surround
But nevertheless they also have a good rooftop lounge to accommodate the sunset view.
Good foods, nice and clean rooms, nice staffs. Just perfect!"
"Room is very clean, location is very good, nearby a Italian restaurant. Staffs is very polite"
"I don't usually write reviews but this one deserves it. Everything is almost perfect--the cleanliness, the kitchenette and utensils, the kind staffs, the location, the infinity pool with very very great sunset of Pantai Berawa. Maybe a little touch on the bedding would be great--I was wishing for a fluffier pillows (or maybe 4 pillows for the kings bed so each of us could get two pieces). But overall, everything is great."
Their location are pretty wise. Walking distance to Berawa Beach. And their room are clean and we can see Berawa Beach through the balcony also watching sunset on their rooftop.
"This is an exceptional hotel - clean, well located and great staff. Only drawback is that restaurants stay open only till 9pm and the beach music does not let you sleep at night sometimes."
Lovely hotel with two fabulous pools. Great location near to beach and beach clubs. We slept very well. Beds were comfy and rooms modern and clean.
Really loved our stay here! Wonderful service from the staff. The hotel is new and we really enjoyed our time here! It’s a short walk to berawa beach and also 10-15 walks from the cafes in canggu. Will stay again!
Great location but they are building a new hotel just in front so it will be more crowded in the future. Excellent friendly service from all the hotel staff. Nice rooftop pool with great view of Berawa Beach. Restos and shops are within short walking distance.
"Really kind and helpful staff. 3 mins walk to Berawa beach and within 10 mins walk to some of the best restaurants in Canggu. Functional and modern rooms with washing machines on site. Rooftop infinity pool has a great view for the beach and sunrise/set. G/F pool is more chilled. Sound proof can be better but that seems to be the common issue with a lot of hotels in Bali. I did find a spider and a cockroach in the room but guess that happens when you are in the nature. It is a family friendly hotel but didn’t bother me as a solo traveller. Overall, really great place to stay for Canggu!"
"The hotel is strategic with many restos around, perfect to be just stating at the hotel for doing work."
"The staff is really friendly and helpful and makes sure I enjoy my stay here. The location is very near to the beach. My room is not soundproof, so I can hear the sounds from the streets at night.  But overall, I am satisfied with my stay here, considering the price that I paid!"
"Nice rooftop bar and pool overlooking beach, which is a 5-minute walk. Has free laundry washing machines. Friendly staff."
"The location is great near Berawa Beach within walking distance. Near canggu & seminyak area for good restaurant. Room facilities was great, they provide mini kitchen complete with cooking set. And hotel facilities also great especially the rooftop pool. The view from rooftop pool was superb."
"newly build in 2021 and definitely one of the resort / hotel that have minimalist/clean feel
what’s very distinctive would be their service, this is by far the best service we’ve ever experienced throughout our stay in bali. there’s no “discount” in service here although we’re in the midst of a pandemic (unlike some other resorts)
good job! will def stay here again should we decide to stay in canggu area again"
"Pros: Price point very good. Great AC and selection of English TV stations. Great responsive service. Quiet street with 10 minute walk to many good quality restaurants.
Cons: Roof deck too small near pool and bar. Hotel is huge and has a feel of a minimalist campus. Mostly younger tourists and couples; not a place for families with young kids. Beds too hard. Bathroom too small. Ground floor where I stayed has a moldy smell emanating from the bathroom drains."
"Center of canggu , near the beach, small but clean room, pleasant staff, pretty good food."
"Loved this place! Beautiful hotel in Canggu. The rooms are lovely and clean with great views. The bed is on the firmer side and the bathroom had a proper door (not just glass). The staff here were the best, so friendly, so fun and the food/drinks were epic on the rooftop bar with the beautiful pool looking towards the ocean. The only downside for us was location, there is lots of construction going on so soon this will be no issue but otherwise if you don't ride bikes everything is a bit of a walk and in 30 degree heat that was a struggle. Before we come back I'll be getting a motorbike license so this isn't an issue and we can stay again at this beautiful place"
"This is a new hotel and i like the concept of this hotel. It’s modern and more importantly is the cleanliness✨Room is also quite spacious with complete facility, and even has apartment kitchen-like facility. Will surely comeback here🫶🏻"
"In general, it was an extraordinary stay at Citadines in terms of the service rendered and all-encompassing in-house facilities.
Food was great but still room for improvement with people seeking a robust and heavier flavour.
Understandable that the vicinity is still undergoing construction and development which I have no issue, except for having to cross the winding road outside to reach the beach and other amenities, that was dominated by pet and stray dogs which could pose a fear during their morning barks when you walk across.
Apart from the mentioned, the hotel was indeed a good catch, with pleasant and helpful staff, and a nice small acoustic band playing on random nights.
Should check it out, which I believe the surroundings will be an added-value to the hotel once the area is further refurbished."
"great location, 5 mins walk to Berawa Beach and surrounded by awesome cafes"
I stayed here with my dog and it had pet playground so my dog could play around. She was so happy.
"The exterior design of the hotel is very artistic & great. Room is very convenient with complete facilities like in studio apartment (microwave, fridge, sink, stove, basic cooking tools 😄). Parking area is small so will be challenging if u drive a big car. This one of the best hotel if you want to stay longer in Canggu 👍👍"
"Everything was great ! I stay here twice. But for the 2nd time little bit disappointed cause the air conditioning didn’t working properly. So I need call the maintenance in the early morning around 4AM and they straightly check the conditions , try to fixed it but still working didn’t well. Overall I loved being here, staff, kids play, gym, excecutive room awesome!"
"Walking distance to the Berawa beach,, they provide parking area, the room is clean and comfortable, near Finn beach and Atlas beach fest.. recommended hotel/apartment in Canggu"
Everything was great especially the staffs. The only problem was when they had live music on the roof top and my room was just underneath. It was so loud - couldn’t even watch the TV. It started at 6 and I was told the music would stop at 9pm but it went till 10ish.
"Booked this hotel last minute and they granted my request for early check-in. Just 3-minute walk to Berawa Beach. Love their hospitality and facilities such as mini kitchen with cutleries, gym, laundry room, swimming pools. Definitely will come back!"
One of the best hotel stays in Canggu. Clean and very nice ❤️
"What I like about this hotel
- Walking distance to Berawa Beach 
- Close to Cafés, Restaurants, Supermarket 
- The hotel provide Washing Machine"
Very impressed with this hotel
"End of Dec 2021.
Clean and new hotel.
Room size was just OK.
Comfortable room.
Walking distance to some of my favorites cafes and coffee shops (BAKED, Lusa by Suka, NUDE, TYGR).
4 minutes walk to Berawa beach, great for sunset."
"Nice new hotel with complete facilities, and in the middle of Berawa-Canggu, the most happening place in Bali at the moment!"
"it is a newly built hotel, facilities and room were pretty clean and modern. The beds are into my liking. They have a pretty spacious balcony with sea view. What I love the most is the rooftop infinity pool, very beautiful view. They have a good restaurant with a variety of meals to choose from."
"Relaxing stay in Canggu Bali. Hotel located near several beach clubs, e.g., Finn's, Atlas, etc.  Nearby Berawa Beach needs to improve cleanliness to attract international tourists."
"Very convenient to get around and hotel's rooftop pool is super nice, overlooking Berawa Beach!"
"While the room and amenities were great, we were placed right next to some kind of engine/generator room which meant constant loud machine noise which made sleeping quite difficult.  We had also initially booked a twin room and upon checking in it turned out to be a double so we had to wait to be switched to the right room.  So to put us near all this room after the initial hassle was quite disappointing.  Otherwise the hotel, staff, and rooms themselves are quite lovely."
Everything is perfect except when it’s raining. Expect a flood in your room when it’s heavy raining. But overall was fine.
"The location of this place is really great in theory but also not so great if you enjoy sleep. A close walk to heaps of good restaurants, nice coffee shop at Trove nearby and a short walk to Berawa Beach. There are 2 mega beach clubs Atlas and Finns on Berawa Beach so we found that there were quiet a few rowdy and sometimes heavily intoxicated guests during our stay. There is also zero sound proofing so unfortunately you get the doof doof from the clubs until after midnight. 
The staff were really professional, the rooms were nice, both the roof top pool and bottom level pool were lovely. We were working from our room for 3 days and the internet was good except for the last day when I think they were hosting a conference. The coffee at the hotel cafe is terrible which would be fine if they werent charging 4.50 AUD for a small. Overall it really is a nice accommodation but you need to be prepared to put up with the noise at night."
"This hotel is newly built, professionally managed. Definitely come back"
"If you looking for hotel/apartment stay in canggu area, then you need to put this hotel in your top list. The location is just perfect. 2 minutes by walk to Berawa beach, 5-10 minutes to Atlas and Finn club beaches, and surrounded by several mini markets, cafe and groceries. 
The facilities are also great. Two pools (sky and earth), spacious enough room with stove, and washing machine (this is very rare in Indonesia)! So I think if you want to stay longer it will be super ok. 
The cons is, because this are is kind a in the heart of canggu and the price also ok, just be ready to have many young noisy travelers (especially in the rooftop). Also, some staffs do not look really happy while welcoming us."
"Citadines was a nice option for my wife and I in the Canggu area. It’s accessible to shops and restaurants, along with the beach. The staff were great and facilities clean. 
The main pool is only 3 feet high whereas the infinity pool is 4 feet. Music can be heard from Atlas Beach Club till midnight when they close."
"We booked our stay here the night before for a decent price (considering we were last minute). The hotel and rooms were modern and clean. The bedding was above average. The food (breakfast) was a little disappointing. There is no buffet and you are required to pick one dish from 7-8 options. That being said, there are a ton of great restaurants in the surrounding area."
"good; room condition, pool, kitchen, staff, cleaning service, laundry place
Bad: location (construction is everywhere), price"
"lokasi strategis, kamar sangat luas, breakfast not bad, overall says puss dgn hotel ini"
"Clean, great staff, lovely room. Too bad they’re doing constructions next door."
"The room stylish and 2 mnt walk distance to the beach, staff are friendly and helpful the only think a bit noisy during the day because Contruction next door front and left side from hotel."
"Room walls are very thin with tiles floor so sound travels. In the new building, mattress is very bad. Definitely not the place if you need a little quiet. Front desk crew are amazing and very helpful to accomodate, thumbs up on that."
"This hotel is located closer to the brewara Beach and a street away connecting to the main street where you can find lots of cafes and restaurants.  New hotel and maintained well. They have limited options for breakfast., thats the only downside."
The hotel was nice and near beach. Value for money
"Location near berawa beach, 5 minutes walking from hotel. Room is spacious and have apartment amenitiea"
"Modern, maintain and memorable"
The location was spot on.. walking distant to canggu city centre
"The checkin process was too long, I had to ask three times whether the room ready or not and they wanted to check and let us know but they didn’t say anything. However, literally the next 4 guests came after me (they were foreigners) and the checkin process were so quick and they gave them the key. After I got the key, I asked for my belongings and they said they would take them to my room, I waited so long I was in a rush because I have appointment and wanted to change clothes. I opened the door while waiting and they gave the luggages to the other rooms first where literally my room was the one they passed first but ended up the last one, as a result I missed my appointment. I don’t know if it’s pure mistakes but why do I get the feeling that the staff kinda r**ist (?) and also they way they greet locals and foreigners are so different smh. Property and location wise are very good."
"between floors is very noisy, so it is very disturbing while sleeping.  Food quality is very bad"
"between floors is very noisy, so it is very disturbing while sleeping.  Food quality is very bad"
"Construction everywhere. Traffic everywhere. 
The kind people that work at this hotel took care of me. The best part of the stay was the local Balinese people so nice!!!!!!!!
Hotel cleaning boys are loud. They clean and party. Hey, at least their happy!"
"The hotel located in Canggu area. There are lots of traffic, congested road, no path for walking people, no street light. Newly developing area. You can see many Constructions, rice farm around. Hotel 4 star but standards not 4 star.  they need to improve towel quality, comfortable of sofa , pillows, bed.  Really they need to improve breakfast quality and quantity. It was very poor.  But hotel is new , clean hotel. Staff very friendly, helpful. Very professional."
"Actually, overall not a bad hotel but you need to know
- The rooms are not soundproof
   My room balcony is facing swimming pool.. I heard loud noise of kids playing at the swimming pool and also heard loud noise of kids at the corrider.. So basically, very noisy
- my room is a 2 persons room, but they provide 1 dental kit only.. And they provide 2 pillows only.. We are 2 persons, we need 4 pillows
- I bought this room thru Agoda, and I bought it with"
"Nothing stands out, it’s just okay."
Good location but the breakfast was terrible!
Booked the hotel room 3 weeks before and asked for specific king bed but still getting two twin put together.
"I don't recommend a room on the first floor.
It is inconvenient because there is a lot of smell of sewage and bugs or mosquitoes.
The bed was uncomfortable because it was noisy with club music at night."
"Great stay! Breakfast was delicious, pool was excellent, and the staff were so warm and friendly. Gym was great too. Recommend!"
Good hotel located in Canggu. Near to Canggu beach and hotel is clean. But breakfast options is limited.
"It's our 2nd time here and now we were stayed for a week. Great service as always.
Located  in hype area of Bali, Canggu.
Walking distance to Berawa Beach, beach clubs, shops, cafes and bars.
And best place to stay for our dog as well.
He can play at the dog playground at the roof top or simply at the mini garden in the room"
"Overall, I'm satisfied with this hotel. Short walk to the beach and restaurants. We had to change room because we smelled smoke from our room. The staff was very patient with us."
"The hotel room is great. seems new. I would stay here again. but in front of the hotel there's construction, I asked for a room away from it. Also the pool is really nice."
"Near to beach ,cafe and eateries"
Title Explains it. Book at your own risk.
Very nice hotel in a perfect position!
Great spot close to shops and restaurants. Really enjoyed the rooftop area.
Everything is great as per expectations. Location is definitely a plus point if you are heading to a nearby beach club such as finns or atlas.
good
"Highly recommended. Facilities are top notch, I would say best in the area"
"Comfortable, spacious and clean hotel. Worth the money."
Highly recommended! Great service special Arde! Hope to book again there soon
"Location : away from the busy roads, 
less than 5 mins walk to the beach.
 5-10 mins walk to the shops.
Not many drivers/riders asking if you need transport which is a huge plus for solo travellers that likes to walk.
Hotel : reception staffs were all friendly, open and helpful. There was one that always engaged with me from the moment i check in til i check out. He remembered my name, I’d say hes the most hardworking man there. 
Room wise, massive, cozy, clean, amenities are all there, there is even a mini kitchen for yourself ; convenient for long stay
Honestly, this was the best place for me."

"Leider riechen alle Zimmer nach Abfluss… wir haben das Zimmer einmal gewechselt, jedoch blieb der Geruch nicht aus…."
"Das Hotel ist recht neu und liegt nahe zu Finns Beach Club und Atlas Club. Die Zimmer sind komfortabel, das Badezimmer modern. Wie fast überall in Asien sind die Zimmer nicht wirklich schalldicht, aber auch nicht zu laut."
"Das Hotel ist mega! Die Mitarbeiter sind extrem freundlich, es ist total sauber und auch die Bilder stimmen mit dem online Bildern überein und das hatten wir auf ganz Bali das erste Mal. Alle anderen Unterkünfte sind schon sehr heruntergekommen, doch nicht Citadines. 
Bei uns wars einzige Manko, dass wir ne rießen Spinne im Bad.... Der Mitarbeiter hat Gift gesprüht und die Spinne lag um 5 morgens Tod da, davor haben wir und kaum rein getraut. Aber dafür kann das Hotel wenig in einem tropischen Land."
"Kamar luas dan sangat bersih.  Breakfast enak. Lokasi sangat dekat dgn Atlas Beach fest dan Finns Beach Club,  tinggal jalan kaki."
"Hotel yang bersih, kitchen set komplit berikut peralatan memasak, dekat dengan pantai dan hiburan ....."

"신축이라 깨끗한건 인정이요. 수영장도 좋고 조식도 먹을건 없지만 야외에서 먹는 느낌 좋고요
직원분들 친절하시고 특히 루프탑 직원분들 최고
다만 위치가 애매해요. 전 핀스 가려고 여기 잡았는데 막상 밤에 걸어올 거리가 아니예요. 불빛 하나 없는 민가라 무서워요

"여기에 아이들과 14일동안 묵었습니다...
전체적으로 깨끗하고..직원들 친절합니다
다만 비치클럽 근처라 밤 12시까지는 시끄럽지만....
참을만 했구요.... 근처에 큰 마트도있고 맛집도 많아서 너무 즐거운 시간 보냈습니다~~!!"
"세탁기가 있어 한두번 사용하기 좋았어요. 
수영장 옆에 넓은 쇼파베드도 좋았는데

제일 좋은건 룸이 였어요
발코니. 요리할 수 있는 키친. 깨끗한 화장실"
"Awalnya ragu pesan hotel ini karena lokasi nya jauh dari Bandara. Tp pas sampe di hotel gak sangka hotelnya nyaman bgt, staf nya jg ramah bgt. Bisa laundry di hotel & dikamar dilengkapi dengan dapur mini lengkap dengan peralatan masaknya.  
Sayang nya pas breakfast menunya sedikit & kurang varian menu. Lebih ke menu western dari pada Indonesia. Lokasi hotel jg sangat strategis dekat dengan Finns Club, La Brisa, Cafe buat nongki2 syantikkk😁
Next, klo ke Canggu lg mau nginep disini lg. 
Thankyouuu…."
"Lokasi sangat tepat, selain dekat dengan Berawa juga dekat dengan banyak tempat makan.
Sekedar saran, sarapan pagi terasa terlalu mahal dan terkesan biasa"
