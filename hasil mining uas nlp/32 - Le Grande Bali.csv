"We booked one bedroom apartement, suitable for family with 2 young child! We love our room, our bathroom was big, love the food and the staff.
We already been a loyal customer for 11 years! Welldone legrande"
"Lovely hotel, we had a spacious and clean room, balcony overlooking the pool, and nice bathroom with a bath. There are many facilities including a couple of pools and a gym, we used the tennis court a couple of times (but begrudged having to pay for the rackets). There’s nothing near by, you would need some form of transport to go to any restaurants."
"I am beyond thrilled with my month-long stay at Le Grande resort. The staff were not just friendly but made us feel like royalty with their exceptional customer service. Our room was beautiful! It was fit for a king and queen with it being cleaned to immaculate standards daily. The hotel had everything we needed and more and was located in a quiet and serene area, making it the perfect sanctuary to come back to after a day of adventure. I felt safe and taken care of throughout my entire stay. I cannot recommend Le Grande enough and I am already looking forward to my next visit."
"This is the cheapest hotel with bath tub that I ever had. The breakfast is also good. Unfortunately I scared when I had to go to lobby in the night, but everything was great. I would like to come back to this hotel ✨"
"Though it is quite deep in (as it is on a golf course), it is tranquil and room is very huge. Facilities provided are good too."
It’s was very nice
"The location might not be strategic enough, but if you're looking for calm and peace place in uluwatu/pecatu area, this place is perfect for you. This hotel have beautiful greeneries surroundings and located exactly beside new kuta golf. The hotel has many sport facilities as well, gym,fields, and 2 pools. I saw comments about the green water and bad reviews before, and I was afraid. But after experienced it myself, I have nothing to complain about. The rooms are spacious, bathroom is also spacious,clean, and comfortable. I have no water issues, the pools are clean. The green water is only located on the pond. it might be disturbing aesthetically, but nothing to do physically. As for the breakfast, it might seems they have little varieties of food choices, but for 5 star hotel with IDR 300ish range of price, I think it's so worth it. They keep the eggs,bacon,sausage, lots of pastries, milk and cereal, and other main dishes. The only issues I have is the way to reach my room from the lobby, since this hotel is huge and I got lost sometime. Overall I enjoyed my stay here for 5 days. Will come back again for sure."
"Value for money, complete breakfast, great view and scenery, bathub in the room also nice pools."
"I had only booked for 1 night and ended up staying for 3. Great hotel, staff and facilities and excellent price. Will be back"
The service and everything in this hotel is perfect!!!!! x
"Best Room, but main pool is being repaired... it's oke cause there is another pool.... my family have fun"
"The hotel is far from the main street, but it has its charm. The nature surroundings are beautiful, the hotel itself give a calm vibes as well. The room and bathroom are spacious, balcony also very comfy. Facilities are 5 star, lots of sport facilities. Breakfast is okay, they have bacon and sausage. Have no water issues. Overall it is a good place to stay"
"PROS: Nice handy location to local beaches, quiet at night, great staff. 
CONS: Breakfast is good but could be great with small tweaks. Air-con needed a service but staff were very helpful and offered a room change.
OVERALL:  Good hotel and great price during the covid period. We've stayed here twice now and plan to be back again in a few weeks."
Great experience staying here. Staff is great and breakfast is very good
"Untuk hotel bintang 5 dan dengan harga yang bersahabat, Le Grande is the best"
Great place!
"The location was quite far from the main road because we had to enter into some complex first. The hotel building was quite enormous, when I ask the staff, he said that it consists of 4 buildings. The room and bathroom was quite big. But they didn’t provide floor mat for the bathroom so I had to ask them for it. The breakfast was standard, nothing special. It was quite a good deal for 5 star hotel."
Very nice hotel in the middle of the golf course and a short drive to Dreamland beach. Hard to judge what it would be like during normal trading as it's huge - hundreds of rooms -  and there were only a dozen guests maybe. But for our stay it was very good value.
Le grande is good
"With reasonable price I got big room, big bathroom with bathtub and shower, tasty breakfast, gym and pool. The hotel is so big and the location is really nice too. The staffs are helpful."
"Lovely helpful staff, little children - friendly poolside and rooms, delicious food both  in room service and in breakfast buffet. Overly very happy with my stay, thank you!"
"Great Internet, Friendly staff and amazing location."
Very recommended for stay in Long Time or short visit in Bali........especially for the Honeymoon Couples.
We spend around a week there and really enjoy the stay there.
"This venue is nothing short of amazing. Located next door to a golf course and near beautiful beaches; It's Uluwatu after all... Great gym, excellent pools, great kitchen on premises. There is absolutely everything you need on this resort. Play a few holes while you are at it. Fast internet. Great for digital workers who needs 5 star accommodations to close big projects while working remote. Clear your thoughts, meditate, play tennis, bathe in marble tubs with full walk in marble showers. Private pool if you upgrade. Note: Add the breakfast to the room and save a few bucks."
"Hotel is aged but generally clean and house keeping Is neatly done. We have pool access, first they don’t have double bed, offer to change room next day, the air conditioning is very quiet and a good Chinese brand split air. Breakfast is good choice, dinning area not to big, hotel is 30% . The private pool is good . Generally value for money. The golf facility is not part of hotel and quite expensive for 18 holes. A bit remote to surrounding dining area but grab can do delivery, very cheap . Don’t order dominoes pizza as they never delivered and they clicked as complete and we made complaints to Grab .  Take blue bird taxi is much cheaper.  Must try Jimbranan Open Ocean feast, a better price for all live sea food! The jimbran beach seafood is very expensive and not live seafood."
"We stayed there for 1 night. The hotel is very big and beautiful but a bit old. The staffs are helpful and friendly. The swimming pools are very nice and clean, you can see golf course from there. Breakfast was nice and tasty. Bed is very comfortable. Will come to this hotel when visit Bali. I don't know why some people gave bad reviews. I had a good experience staying there."
Will be back
"Nice Hotel, very spacious room, we have Suites Deluxe room with living room, suitable for Family with many member, King bed can sleep three peoples"
If you're couple this's the best choice you have
"Good for relaxing.  Nice view from pool and restaurant.
Far from City.  Need to improve room and bathroom. too old."
Will be back
Will be back
"Excellent service and facilities. The staff were friendly and helpful. Plenty of leisure activities provided by the hotel facilities if you don't feel like going anywhere else. The location is very near to Dreamland beach and it is located in a secluded closed off area with security guards to keep the area free from unwanted traffic. Not recommended for those looking for parties, clubs, or city vibes because it is quite far from Kuta/Legian area, even Jimbaran.  
So much love for the bath tub and separate showers. Downside would be there are no hotel slippers.  No bath robes either to wrap up in after a long bath. And not enough closet space or even a table to put my large suitcase on. So I had to put my suitcase on the bed which is not recommended when it's been lugged around the airport. 
The breakfast is standard. Had an issue with sour sausages on my second day. Overall a great stay and will book again."
"The check-In experience was great. Though when I entered the room I saw that there were 2 beds instead of 1 large bed as booked. I asked check-in counter to change the room and left for a meeting.
When I came back and got the key I found my luggage safely stored in the new room (great!). But inside of the room the was a slight pee smell (👃 foul scent often coming from mold). 
It's understandable here in  Bali, because It is a very humid environment so I did not say anything.
But after spending some hours in the room and going to sleep I woke up in 2 hours with anxiety, fast and heavy breathing and urge to leave the room. 
In other words - my body was reacting to staying in this room as it would have poison inside. Sadly it is possible to get mold poisoning after long exposure to breathing air with it. I had friends who had severe poisoning from hidden mold.
I also have had reactions in the past on moldy environments so I knew it was that which triggered it.
So instead of having a great night in a great hotel I had to leave the room and had 2h of sleep. This fucked up my business trip to Uluwatu since I was very tired afterwards.
I had a one night stay at this place and would be afraid to come back there again if the mold issue would be the same. 
Hopefully  the hotel is reading this. The room number was 4004"
Really enjoyed staying here except the bent lock on my room door with room location made me nervous.  The rooms/common areas were still being upgraded after covid so there wasn't any choice for me to move.  The poolside massage was excellent and my favorite area of the hotel was the restaurant patio.  Pool was very nice as well. Staff were all excellent and helpful.  The only downside was there wasn't much to walk to from this location but they do have drivers at the front door should you need them.
"This hotel is very good, staff very friendly and their facility its good"
"Comparing the price to the experience, it was very worth. Facilities provided, the hotel's surrounding is also quite, which is good to have private time"
Cheap and clean
Good service and facility. Closeby nice beaches.
"Overall is good to stay there, just advise to management to adding net to protect swimming pool from golf yard next to it. 
it so dangerous to let it open like this. hope they can resolve it quickly."
"Restaurant makes good nasi goreng and beef rendang. Suggest going for breakfasst with stay as its more convenient. Staff was friendly and the hotel is tucked away in Uluwatu. 
Could use an upgrade in the cleaning department but overall 4/5 because of value for money and friendly staff."
Very Nice place and big👍🏼

"I was excited to stay at this hotel since it looks so nice and enjoyable in photos but it ended up with disappointment. As a 5 star hotel, the hot shower was not hot at all. It was frustrated when i wanted to have a relaxing bath after a long day but the water was really cold. The AC in the room was also leaking."
Perfect value for money paid.
"Should renovate the floor boards , circulate the air in gym , room, etc"
"I was ground level with view on the pool and the smell in the room was horrible. It was a mix of humidity and cigarette and I was actively delaying the moment that I had to go back to my room to sleep because of it. All the sheets and towels have big yellow staines on them and do not smell clean either. Also, my room was (I'm not kidding) 10 mn away from reception and during my stay of 6 nights, I've had to go 4 times to the reception after going to my room and trying to unlock my door and it was never working. I was really carefull as to not put the key with my phone or key or anything but almost every night I've had to do the walk again and again from reception to my room because the key wasnt working. Just disapointments over disapointments which led to me not recommanding this hotel."
Very spacious room with awesome staff. Cleanlines can be a bit compromised but overall a very memorable stay
Amazing offer for the good hotel!
"Well, in terms of maintanance this hotel not so well maintained. My friend got some minor accident where got some nail at the bed and caused her bleeding a little bit. However, after inform to the recepcionist they right away fix the bed. But its still left some unpleasant experience."
"It is a nice hotel, the room is really spacious. We book one bedroom suite which is very big, but it will be better if the hotel could improve in cleanliness and maintaining the public facilities like garden, pool, etc"
"Need more improve on asian food especially nasi goreng, it really teas less. Regarding swing pool need more do cleaning in term of water of pool."
"If you are there to chill by the beaches, surf, have a retreat, Le Grande is the perfect if you are on a budget!"
"What a spacious hotel, but the the lighting was a bit dark, so it gave a little creepy feeling. But still, hotel's clean and the staff's friendly."
"Very relaxing , chilled place, great staff, great breakfast great value for money"
"I don't know why management tolerates the level of incompetence and laziness of their staff - FO, F&B as well as housekeeping. If this can be turned around, this will be a really great resort. Maintenance is also lacking both in the rooms and outside but understandable given the pandemic situation causing volume and prices to be depressed. The main pool and deck area was recently renovated and is very nice. There are scheduled shuttle buses to the nearby beaches which I didn't use. The satellite TV was down when I was there but there was a ping pong table and table soccer (but couldn't find the ball for table soccer). The gym is a bit dated (for the weights stations) but still well stocked. I am not sure if the AC is working as I have never seen it on. People were working out with the windows open but maybe this was by choice for covid safety  reasons.  The breakfast was buffet style all 3 days I was there. It is just ""ok"" with enough to fill you up if you are hungry.  The eggs station chef cannot do scrambled eggs properly, I suspect this is more due to lack of motivation than anything else. Wait staff were also hiding behind the counter eating, or chatting among themselves, rather than circulating among the tables.  This should not be happening in a 5 star hotel."
"very nice, very valuable, will visit again"
"Good hotel for group/family. Quite far from main road, so make sure you bring your necessity before coming to hotel"
The Hotel is in an „Hotel area“ so Hotel is Great do a vacation where you just like to stay at the Hotel. Of course you kann rent a scooter for 100k at the Hotel and drive to the beaches and stuff. But you cannot go anywhere by foot.
"Very good location, far from noisy places, big pool and rich breakfast, for this money very affordable"
"Good , Comfortable, Neat,  Quiet."
"Be careful by booking the room here. The location is perfect and the territory around the hotel is stunning, just the rooms are old, dirty bedsheets, towels. Could not sleep the first night and wanted to move to another hotel."
"Kamarnya besar, bersih, overall hotel butuh banyak maintenance utk area taman, lorong hotel dan area lobby. Sukses selalu"
Good discount .
Very cheap price for a good hotel. Highly recommend to stay for a short or long stay. Relaxing and peaceful place for a family or a couple.
"It's good value, alittle old but its cheap & clean. Breakfast very good . Dinner good ,very quiet peaceful for 2days"
Good hotel but little bit creepy in the night. Maybe because of not much guests at that time. But overall good
"The room is very spacious. But the hotel is not clean, the room is dusty, and the worst part for me, the toilet shower is quite dark (i dare not bath alone😅😅). The breakfast is so so.."
Wifi is not working wel and also picture from tv5 was not clear
"Booked a double room suite for 4 days. Location of the hotel is good. A little tucked in, but good if thats what youre looking for. Cleanliness is ⭐️⭐️. Its old and dusty. One of the beds in one of the bedrooms actually broken. It cracked into two when i sit down. And the bed sunk. Spiderwebs everywhere too. One of the bathtubs wasnt in a good condition. The water was yellowish. There werent much variety on breakfast. Pretty much the same every morning. When we checked in, there were many guests had problem with their reservations, including us. We werent able to check in until 4 pm!"
At least the staff were nice (most of them). From day 1 they made me wait for my room to be cleaned and sent me to the restaurant. I waited 45 mins and nobody helped me. Then people started arriving and still no help. I left the manager was sent to speak to me and he didn't care just left after I said nobody helped me. The hotel looks better on pictures than the actual place.
"so far so good, kinda sad but cleanes not to fully on all area, maybe in covid situation ."
"- staff : friendly and helpful
- room : really dark, oldies, and feel scary because from the lobby to the room is different building (we check in at 6pm) so we should walk maybe 5 minutes and make us confuse for the room sign. But the view really nice! I got view to golf and garden (so fresh)
- area : this hotel inside pecatu indah resort and this hotel in the end of the resort so if you guys need to go outside to buy a meal or  go to supermarket maybe take 2km to exit the resort"
"1. dirty water from bathtub and shower room. rusting water smells. 
2. outdoor bathtub not functioning at all 
3. No indoor slipper provided"
The hotel did the job - the main pool is the nicest part of the hotel. It is very tired hotel and very old - the photos do not resemble the hotel at all - as they make it look stuning
"The place is ok for a break.  Had a 2 bedroom suite and it was massive.  However, it is a bit dated and needs Some tlc. 
In general the resort is ok, and quite ok, but definitely not a 5 star.  I would rate it more 3.5-4.  
Main drawback is the location.  It is a long way from anywhere.  
They have rental scooters though and we got 2 and had a lot of fun on them.  We went as far as Nusa day in the scooters - and they have us the ability to eat outside the resort and save a massive amount of money.  
Because we were there for 13 nights we were VIP guests.  They could not do enough to look after us.  The chefs etc are fantastic, and a special shout out to Yogi - who looked after us exceptionally from day one.  Even getting us special things we liked for our breakfast that were not on the buffet.
I would recommend this hotel for people who are happy to rest and relax away from the crowds.  Especially if you don’t mind riding scooters ( a lot of fun and not dangerous). But it’s not 5*"
THE ROOM IS WIDE AND THE BEST MATRASS I EVER HAD .. UNFORTUNATELY NO COOKING EQUIPMENT PROVIDE BUT THERE IS STOVE   ... THERE ARE 2 SWIMMING POOLS ONE IS BIG ONE IS MEDIUM ... BREAKFAST EVEN ALLACARTE CAN BE ORDER MANY TIMES ...
It’s a decent hotel make no mistake. But a basic one.
"Le Grande is a great brand..but unfortunately the hotel it self have so many things to improve, I thinks it's relate to the pandemic situation. The hotel was lack of maintainance, the second pool have a wooden deck where the wood need attention, it's stink and molds are everywhere. 
Breakfast are okay but there's not much variation, the room is dark and a little bit hummid. 
But the staff really friendly during my stay, they help to provide all we need, there's also a free rent bycycle for recident to used during the stay.."
"They didn't check the room before we entry. There are some dark spot on the floor that i have to call cleaner when we arrive, AC is down multiple times i have to call the engineer at 2 a.m. There's some maintenance so we can't use the main some of it's facilities . But breakfast were great"
"large bed, spacious room with bath up and separate shower but the tv doesn’t work and the furniture looks old."
Quiet location within a golf estate but is now catered to package tourists. No views from hotel but a few decent beaches around. There are shuttles but they are infrequent. Food had no taste. We paid 3 nights and tried to leave after 1 but only got a refund for 1 night so we stayed 2.
be Better :)
The pool is not clean at all & also the room isn’t very clean.
Great hotel in a quiet location.Rooms were spacious and modern.
"Accomodations was cheap so you get what you paid for. Breakfast was ok.
Location of the hotel was quite far away from local hotspots but it is very quiet as it was far from everything. Had to book a grab everytime I wanted go somewhere but should not be a problem if you know how to drive and rent a vehicle.
However, the place is a bit run down, it was different from the pictures online and on agoda. They turn off the lights during the day so it looks a bit dark at some corners. While I was staying there could see that they were trying to fix parts of hotel where it was broken.
I had the room with pool access but didn't use it at all because the pool didn't look clean and there were a lot of mosquitoes and flies there were even signs to keep the door to the pool closed to prevent mosquitoes from coming in. The hotel had a lot of bodies of water that were still so I think that contributed the mosquito problem. Don't book the rooms near a pool if you want to open the balcony doors to let the sun in.
The linen, pillows had little stains on them and the room looked run down as there were small broken parts of the floor. The curtains also was not clean at all and had alot of yellow stains on them.
The hotel staff were nice and had warm smiles on their faces everytime I walked past or talked to them."
We’re booked suite room it’s so extraordinary room and the price so cheap but the cleaness is bad  and response of staff on check in are slowly until 1 hour waiting for.
"Value good 
Staff limited English 
No concept of a cold beverage 
Place is tired but for price ok"
"Its a very specious place! nice rooms and facilities! 
Staff can be more active and attentive!
easy to get lost around! ty to take a room near the entrance!"
"So far in uluwat, so huge , service ok
Rooms clean , good for two three days max"
"Upon check in was told there are only 2 single bed even though we opted for king bed in advance.
Maybe due to our early arrival (12PM +) we were given a room an hour later far below expectation. I have read some of the good reviews of the hotel before booking thus I was taken aback by the condition of the room plus it's a 5 star hotel. The room is old, have a foul smell, the bed and pillows stinks. Almost like they have not change the bedsheets at all. Requested for pillows to be change, took awhile for the housekeeping team to come and they only changed 2 pillows when I asked to change all 4. 
For transport, was told by the lobby it's red zone so no other transport is able to come in except transport arrange by the hotel. Was taking a 3.5km ride to sidewalk jimbaran mall. When we ask about the price the reception told us to negotiate with the driver. When the driver arrives and told us he is charging 150k IDR (no negotiating because when we ask for cheaper he gave a face and walks off, I saw on grab ride it's 60K IDR). Left with no choice, we took the transport.
At 10pm the first night we suddenly heard loud water noises coming from the toilet area. Went to check and realize that the CEILING is LEAKING. (We are ground floor deluxe room with pool access) when I say leaking it's lots of water falling from the top and goes on to flood the bathroom. Call in to reception to have them send someone over and an hour later still no one is here. (The ceiling is still pouring water after an hour) I had to walk to the reception show them the video and they still ask us to wait for the engineer to come fix it. (It was 11.15pm) after much complains telling them how long it is and to wait for their people to fix, what time are we able to sleep? Then they decide to change a room for us.
We were given a normal deluxe room which definitely looks much better (lesser foul smell, new aircon unit and looks newer) which we decided to just stick with for the next 3 nights. 
Most of t"
"The room is big, but a bit old, however it is clean enough. i think you need to change the light to be brighter OR paint the wall so it looks better."
"The room is spacious and have a good view. I stayed for 2 nights during Silent Day and the facilities in the hotel is superb. They have 3 pools and also buffet breakfast selection is wide.
However, staffs needs to be trained, as during my stay a staff entered the room to put in fruit basket although I have placed Do not disturbed sign at the door. F&B billing system is also not updated thus check out process was lengthy."
Too many flies...
BIG ROOM ...
You get what you pay for!
"The hotel is old and maybe because of the pandemic they lack of staff and only staffing for trainee, so they service for the guest is so poor"
The room is too dark. Surrounding area is also too dark. Not enough light
"The staffs were friendly, but lacknof discipline. During this pandemic, was really important to check the body temperature, but no one check.
I stayed in the 1 bedroom suite. It was really big, but need maintenance. There was a small cockroach in bathroom, the bed and pillow sheets had yellow stains, and also the bathtub. 
The pool was dirty, and I think its not 5 star hotel like it was mentioned in the ratings."
"The room really spacious, BUT, leaking in the restaurant, in the corridor, many floor in every section are wet during heavy rain, it's due to the ceiling are leaking. 
My suggestions :
1. Fix the building, fix the facilities 
2. Get more staff
This is hospitality business, the better you pampering us, the better our willingness to stay again or recommending it to others.
We had good breakfast and rest anyway. Thank You Le Grande Bali. Looking forward for the improvement."
"Would NOT recommend eating in the restaurant, we had a very poor experience but to be fair you have little choice due to the location!"
"First the good: we got a one-bedroom suite for my young family. And the space was very large. More than expected. 
Now the bad: the place has clearly not been maintained well. The room had a strong odor to it. The a/c in the living room leaked literal puddles of water. The bathroom shower was missing several tiles, leaving sharp edges on the floor (dangerous with a toddler). 
Like many places in Bali, the bed had a fitted sheet and a down comforter but no top sheet (makes no sense to me for a tropical climate). So I called the front desk and asked for a top sheet. Ten minutes later someone showed up with another Blanket for me. I had to insist again, I don’t need a blanket, I need a light sheet. They were apologetic and went and got me a sheet. 
We went to dinner at the restaurant, and we were the only ones there while there was a full staff including at least four or five servers. I ordered the ribs, they asked how I’d like them cooked, well done or medium. I said medium. Ten minutes later they come back and say they can’t do medium, it’s already cooked. I can only have it well done. No problem. But really, why did you ask me then?!?  
Then it took 45 minutes for our food to be served. 
Any one of these things would not be that big of a deal, but All of them?!? Definitely left me wishing we’d stayed elsewhere"
The hotel and the rooms are dirty and not well maintained. The location is a little deep inland as well. Breakfast is average. The staff are young and generally helpful. I would book somewhere else.
"Booked a two bedroom suite. 
Hot tub was out of order which we were looking forward to. Rooms were ok. Nice and spacious. Dinner was poor & staff could have been friendlier. We wanted to get a few cocktails the first day only to be told there was no fruit available for the cocktails. The second day came around and We were told there was still no fruit and no rum available for a cocktail. Was very disappointed with our stay and would not recommend"
"the bed was itchy. restaurant was very slow for dinner, altough tgere werent many people. brakfast was ok, coffee was really good. staff was vey polite and helpful."
"Too far from city centre & most attractions.
Too isolated location. No towels in the room.
AC was very noisy. Locker was locked. When asked for water we were told to buy any more drinking water. No scooters available for rent. No shuttle service. Breakfast was good. Staff did try promptly to rectify the short comings."
Staff were not very welcoming. Food was not great. Room cleanliness can be improved… basic amenities like toothbrush and toothpastes not provided. Toilet seems dirty.
"Even though outside area and pool looked nice and quite good, but the room was very bad, lack of cleaness, furniture has seen better days, air conditioning not working properly, bathroom tiles very moldy, even towels not clean with the stains and balcony furniture in terrible condition"
"It really needs a renovation/upgrade. Unfortunately seems very “abandonnen” and a lot of areas that needs a loving touch. The restaurant is good, though, However missing some feeling and not giving the urge to stay for Long."
I have a family suite. Its big and spacious. But the property is not well maintained. Kind of run down. The location also very far from the main road. Hard to find eating places nearby unless you drive.
Location is far from any where .you need to drive 10 min to go out side to find super market or restaurant staff was not good my booking was included kitchen I didn't find and when I ask they agnoring me . condition was not working and they spend one hour to fix rally not recommend to any one.
Stayed here 10 years ago and it was great however they have done no maintenance since then and our room smelt musty booked out 3 nights early and went to newer hotel won’t be back
Hot water was not working and not worth  it.
"Everything is dated, broken and old. Staff are young and not experienced. We need to inform them everyday to clean our room and they forgot to bring new towels. When we asked for new towels it came an hour later. If you hungry don’t bother to order from room service, itll come an hour and half later. We have breakfast same thing every single day… Definitely wont be coming back for sure! And so many renovations going on doesnt make you relax"
Big room but not really good view
"Probably the worst hotel experience I’ve had.
No double bed in my room I booked so had to walk to another room and wait for them to bring the key which took 10mins.. (after being told there was no other room available which wasn’t true) then once in the room there was no towels and the pillows smelled. Then there was no shampoo. We asked for more and they brought us a water bottle full of shampoo !! Then the cleaner cleaned the room.. we came back and the shampoo was still not filled up but the bottle was gone !! Then we asked for more shampoo and they delivered us another water bottle full of shampoo !! My gosh what a nightmare ! I would never stay here again."
"Do to the global lock down the hotel occupancy was maybe 8 people in total, restaurant food quality needed to be better for the price,  only skeleton staff working which is understandable, hotel definitely need a compete renovation."
"Far from everything, our bed smelt like urine and they could move us without charging for an upgrade."
