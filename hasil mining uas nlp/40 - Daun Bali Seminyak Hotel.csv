"Room was perfect! Great location too, staffs are very friendly and service was great. There are also communal microwave and water dispenser. The minor review is for jacuzzi in the rooftop, I think it needs maintanance."
"Stay here many times. Our go to hotel whenever we’re traveling to Bali on budget. Location is best best best! Restos, cafes, spa, mini markets are within walking distance, also Petitenget Beach is only a short ride away. Room is spacious enough, bed is comfortable, staff are friendly and attentive. The hotel also provides water dispenser and microwave in the social hub/ pantry on every floor. We found it very useful as we often order our food delivery and needs to be re-heated. No doubt will recommend everyone to stay here!"
This hotel is so good! Have a pleasant stay here! It has a large nice sofa so you can read your book by the window. Also the staff are super nice. Didn't get the chance to try the rooftop jacuzzi tho
"this hotel provide a good room and facilities, spectacular humble and kind staff who always standby all the time, such a great choice to stay at daun bali, xo"
"Quiet place even though It’s located on a busy street. Everything was spotless from rooms (exactly like in the pictures), HK, front desk, everyone very friendly and ready to help you with everything you need. Would recommend!"
Good place for you if you want to stay at seminyak!
"-Value for money
-Nice and clean hotel
-Very friendly and accommodating staffs"
Nice and clean hotel... The location very strategic...
"This hotel had a big comfortable bed, nice clean bathroom with good shower pressure, and was in a good location. On a Main Street but our room (and most rooms) are off the street, and we heard no street noise. Awesome cafes and places to eat near by by walking or with Go Jek. Would definitely stay here again! & Staff were great :)"
"The room size is just right. Location, superb! Located in one of the busiest street in Seminyak. It's a few steps away from Da Maria and Livingstone Cafe."
"amazing place , very recomended if you like romantic place.
staff very friendly, help full.
the food very delicious."
"Overall the room is very clean, eventhough I found some ants near the window seat but it's okay.  The staff were very kind and helpful. The jacuzzi seems like not 100% working."
"Place is clean, room is large. Jacuzzi isn't working though"
"clean hotel, good service, strategic location, but poor room design"
"Excellent location with lots of cafes and convenience stores, massage parlour nearby! 
Room is clean and air con is very cold and powerful!"
Good place with good deals 👍🏻👍🏻
"We stayed here for 5 days and were constantly greeted with lovely smiles and great service from the staff. 3 points to commemorate the staff. 1) They were patient and polite 2) very accommodating with our requests and 3) prompt and attentive to how we would loved to be served. Rooms are big and clean, no pest lying around. And the location of this hotel is amazing. Plentiful nice cafes and restaurants within short walk. Bike rental is IDR75,000. Very reasonable. No frills at all. We will be back!"
"When I arrived, I didn't know it was the first day the hotel opened. I like the hotel, plenty spaces and many places to dine or eat around . The hotel didn't serve any food so some restaurants were open, so it's good. nice location. recommended absolutely !!!"
Clean and nice room with a really comfortable bed. Located on a busy street with loads of good restaurants and minimarts just walking distance.
Stay almost one week it was great stay ever
Safe and comfortable accommodation.
Safe and comfortable accommodation.
"All 5 stars, except your chillers do not work well."
Staff is so kind & i love welcome drink
"The first time i tried this hotel was because of the cheap price, didnt have any expectations at first. Out of my expectation, it was nice and clean. It suits traveller like me, female solo traveler. Without transport i can still find good food just few steps away. And there’s also a decent spa just across the street. I ended up book this hotel every time i come back bali for work."
"It’s nice hotel to stay around Seminyak area where you can just walk to some places such as restaurants, mini market, etc, room not spacious but just enough for you to rest and clean"
"Walking distance to Pison, Taco Casa."
"try out living stones bakery and cafe which is just located 5 mins from hotel. They serve very nice cakes and bread. Everything is good except tat opposite the hotel is a school. Noise can be heard early in the morning, no issue to me. Not recommend if u wan a peace and quiet environment."
sarapannya terlalu sederhana :) variannya sangat sedikit
I will come back here when I visit Bali again!! The staff are so kind and everywhere is clean
Great location and good value for money.
"Very modern hotel, the design of the open air windy corridors and the swimming pool is nice, location is near to many great restaurants/cafes, staff are friendly. Very enjoyable stay"
everything was good!
"good location, affordable, clean, nice design"
In the Center of Bali. Rooms are neat and clean. Staff is exceptional. Near to Market
"It's a small hotel. But facilities and breakfast it's good, the parking space is too small but they can have valet service. Outside the room, there's a small kitchen to reheat your food with a microwave and add some water."
"""Great Price, Friendly Staff, Great Service, Great Room."""
"The hotel location is great. You don't have to worry about meals since there are a lot of cafes, restaurants, and bakeries near the hotel. The room is clean, bed and sofa are comfortable, and the staffs are super friendly."
best hotel for yum and fun
Easy and comfortable stay. Beds and rooms good 🤩
"Firstly, thank you so much to this hotel for my free upgrading room, from superior premium room to the junior suite one.
This hotel is very recommended to people who want to hang out to some hottest bar/cafe. It's very close to petitenget street, which is very popular to hang out or shop.
Breakfast standard (with the reasonable price what you've expected for a luxury b'fast then)"
"As a 4-star establishment, I honestly expected more in terms of the state of its' facilities. WiFi connection is very weak and constantly cut off in our room, the rainfall shower head doesn't work properly, and the Jacuzzi is quite dirty.
Furthermore, I can't get the twin bed room that I've previously booked even though I have booked it quite in advance. What's the point to book the room if I can't get the one I booked for?
Aside from that, the hotel is located in a prime location as all main destinations in Seminyak area can be reached within walking distance. Our room is clean and the AC is working properly."
I especially love the jacuzzi and mini bar at the rooftop. The staffs are all friendly. The room is decorated with rose petals. ❤️ We didn’t get the the chance to try the buffet though due to limited time :(  We tried different hotels in our 5 days stay in Bali and this is the best hotel we’ve been compared to the 3 other hotels. Thank you!
"We stay for 4 nights, staff is great, amenities is good, cleanliness satisfying, parking lot is small but they will help to valet your car overall this hotel is good place to stay… near from supermarket and restaurants around…"
Hard to move on from daun’s nasi goreng
Value for money.
"We had such a nice time here. The location is great, it’s easy to get a taxi or walk to different areas. There are spas and restaurants nearby too. The staff are extremely helpful should you need anything. The rooms are very modern compared to its surroundings. We really loved it!"
"clean, safe and good location!"
"Good hotel, nice location, nice staffs , recommend"
love this place.
"Great location, hotel is simple and clean, love the rooftop and pool, the room is quite big, love the sofa in the room"
"Stayed here for 2 nights. Location was very nice, parking space is a bit tight but they provide free valet service. Room is very clean. Defnitely worth the price."
"Great location, close to many amenities, supermarket, spa, cafes and eatery etc. 
Highly recommend!"
"good hotel, nice place, clean, easy ro access"
"At this cost, hard to find another"
The room very clean
When I visit Bali I will be back here :)
"This is recomended hotel with good condition, please keep it in good shape, next time I will come again. I recomended to all people to stay here"
It’s a nice place to stay.
Nice hotel but parking slot is very limited
Got a sweet deal from Agoda. We stayed at the junior suite. It's clean and spacious. The wifi was fast. Got nothing to complain about.
"room was good and okey ,maybe just need improvement on air conditioner because the AC not cool enough for me."
"It was my second time staying at Daun, and generally it was not as great as my first experience. The room I was given had a slight sewer smell, and did not have hot water (though I didn’t report this as I was ok to shower in room temp water in the hot weather). 
The bed sheets were very cleaned, with some small stains on the duvet and pillow cases.
Other than that, service staff was always friendly and with smiles.
They are upgrading and heard they will have a gym soon."
the hotel was good and the staffs are friendly
Wish they would increase the room size
"Dont book breakfast in this hotel. It was terrible.
But besides that, all things were amazing."
"One of the famous budget hotels in Seminyak. For its price, the hotel definitely worth the price. The only thing that I disappointed was smel of both of our towels. Asked for change, they came up with new ones but still smelly. Maybe its from the laundry. But overall still a good experience spending 4 nights here."
"I enjoyed my stay at Daun mostly, and found the Superior room to be cosy. Air conditioning was centralised at 18deg celcius and can get too cold at times, but my biggest gripe was the lack of sound proofing at the door. All sounds along the corridor - noisy guests, slamming doors, staffs' walkie talkies could all be heard from inside the room."
Satisfy with all services. I was given bike to get around Seminyak. Complete facility. Will spend a lot more time if visit Bali!!
"The hotel was fantastic with the price we pay.
But the breakfast was horrible.
I was here 4 years ago and its such a big different. I suggest not to take breakfast here.
Its a waste."
Close to many restaurant!
Great for staying
Good location at kerobokan seminyak area.
Hotel is near to many restaurants. Room was well maintained. Big sofa bed for 1. But had to pay extra for sofabed sheet. Breakfast was not so many selections.
"The staff is very helpful, also the hotel facility is excellent. They provide free rent bike. Location is great and near restaurant and café."
"Hotel location was close enough to downtown Seminyak area with lots of eateries close-by. Nonetheless, traffic to and fro the hotel was so bad that a 10min trip from Seminyak beach took over 45 mins. On multiple occasions, my husband and I decided to just alight from the cab and walked back to the hotel instead. 
One thing to note as well is to avoid rooms in the common hall area (request for corner rooms if you can) as the doors slammed shut really loud. The rooms opposite us were occupied by multiple groups of the same families, making the noise level worst."
location is good.. in the central of seminyak..  but so noisy at night.. you can hear people talking in room beside you.. you can also hear foot step from the corridor.. for light sleeper like me you have to consider this before stay here
"Near to minimarket, salon n manymore place"
"good hotel.if there is better breakfast,it will be wonderful"
"Staff there so friendly, my room so clean and I so enjoy stay there, good choose when your short trip in bali."
Overall good!
"Very nice hotel that i found in seminyak, quite cheap, clean and also they provide a free refill water for the guest."
"i really like the ambience of the room, really warm and compact, room lighting was good, have pool, have gym, have jacuzi in rooftop, good location, but the night staff really not good and rude, but morning staff really helpful.
the night staff, even only left us to check in, he still asking our booking with rude, even i already show ID card. the room not clean enough, even the spoon is missing, when i check out, they ask me the spoon, that from the first time, dont have any spoon in the room"
"best budget hotel i've ever stay in Seminyak ! loving the couch bed, big mirror, bathroom, EVERYTHING. Definitely will be back again"
Good value for money. Nice bars and restaurants within walking distance
Fasilitasnya agak gak jelas
"Nice stay overall, but I dont know if they change our towels daily or not, but not the bed sheet, and maybe they need to clean the floor and tea set"
The hotel was really cheap and the room.and much nicer than expected. The location is good too in the middle of seminyak.
"Room is clean, breakfast so so lah, location traffic but strategies, price ok lah"
It’s a nice hotel in seminyak and surrounded with good food with walking distance
"First stayed here when it was still named ZIA,always a pleasant experience.staff always friendly and helpful"
"Room:
Plus: Quite spacey, they have reading corner which I like. Hot water is super ok, no need to wait. They gave 4 pillows, 2 for each person.
Minus: Lack of electricity socket, you should bring you extra socket if you need to plug many devices. WIFI, WORST! Unable to connect to WIFI during my 3 nights stay, if you stay here for business trip, make sure to bring your own WIFI.
Location:
SUPERB. Near coffee shop, convenient store, laundry, and food stalls.
 
Staff:
When I arrive they were super nice, but too bad when I leaving, I have to carry my own luggage to taxi (2 big carrier I had) with no one from staff trying to offer me help.
I hope they extend the  Jacuzzi operation time to midnight.
Overall this was a nice and comfy stay."
"+Jacuzzi on the rooftop is nice, although you have to ask the staff to turn on bubbles every 5 minutes. 
+Rooms are spacious and comfortable.
+Staff is always smiling and happy to help.
+Brekkie is satisfactory for the price.
-Changed room twice because of growing mould. 
-Changed minibar fridge 3 times as it stopped working."
They have jacuzi which is under maintainence. Room was conjested. Breakfast and restaurant tastes great.
It is a good place to take a rest.
"Kamar ok so far, tapi wifi-nya parah.
fasilitas Gym kurang [minim]."
A nice hotel away from the city center. A good place to stay for relaxation.
Worth the money
"The hotel room is clean but the walls are really hollow because we can hear the next door’s guests very clearly🥹. If we can hear them means they can hear us as well. So it isn’t convenient to talk!  
Spoken English from the front desk needs much improvement. They not only cannot speak English properly but road directions given were also wrong so much so that we lost our way and cannot find the beach that we wanted to visit. 
Compared to the hotel we stayed in Ubud where the front desk was manned by very enthusiastic young people who can not only speak good English but are very good in recommending areas to visit, those at this hotel are incapable of doing so!
Don’t think I want to stay here again 🙏."
"We were first-timers here at Daun Bali Seminyak Hotel. It’s a very simple yet comfy kind of stay. I personally love it. The first moment, I came in to the hotel, walking to the reception to check in, I love the hotel right away. 
For Bali stay, this hotel has a pretty bright light (which I love) unlike most of the hotels in Bali that usually has a dim light. 
Room & bed is very simple yet again quite comfortable. The superior room I ordered is actually quite small though, so if you prioritize a staycation, you might check on other hotels but I personally like it. This hotel is perfect for those couple who wants to experience Bali then go back to the room just to rest. The bed to me is very comforting. 
The staffs are really friendly and they seem to want to serve you the best.
Great rooftop with jacuzzi & nice view from the roof. Great swimming pool at least to me. I am satisfied enough with the pool. What’s awesome as well is they provide free bikes (around 6ish bikes I think if I am not mistaken) and it’s free! You can just borrow the bike to go to the beach and other places and no time limit! Awesome! So if you are also a couple like us, you can go riding the bike together with your spouse to visit nearby restos/cafes/places or the beach.
As for the bfast, to be honest, I am not really a fan. They provide only simple meals with simple flavours. I love coffee but the coffee’s here to me is not good. Overall though, the bfast is just okay to keep you energized in the morning. However, if you really are a fan of bfast time, no worries, near the hotel you might find other alternative restos to enjoy bfast. You can walk to Monsieur Spoon (great coffee here, the pastries are also good). Lots of foreigners eating here. If you want fancy food, you can walk to Metis for a romantic din with your spouse. It’s very near. Lots of resto options if you stay here.
I personally would want to stay here again sometime in the future but perhaps I will try their bigger room opt"
nice hotel.
"The place definitely need improvement for the cleanliness, the lightning in the rooms. The towels are old even it's not dirty, the gym can't be called gym as there're only 1treadmill and static bicycle and home dumbells, the pool is so small , I think it's only for hang out or dipping pool. The jacuzzi and the bar closed at 10 pm. I've stayed there for 3 nights and they didn't fix the toilet in my room since my first complain, which was probably I made 6 times complains to the front office . The parking lot is dirty and small, so sometimes the valet your car to other places out of the hotel and you need to ask for the car at least 30 mins before you use it. I like the hotel's concept, but they need improvements for sure. Btw, the lifts are only 2 and dusty."
"WiFi virtually non existance, asked the staff at front desk and they said"" too many people are here"" ?? WTF  Breakfast barely adequate
, Bed linen very worn and not crisp  I could go on but enough is enough"
"I HATE hotels that dont let mw contril the temperature of the room. 
Never stay here unless 26 degrees os your favored sleepong temp.
Avoid!!!!!"
Can I get the refund?
"I would like to thank  Daun Bali and Agoda. Our stay was very phenomonal and relaxing. It was our first time in Bali and we knew that our stay in the hotel was very limited due to daytours for like 4 days.  From the reception the staff was very approachable. We arrived earlier than expected so we requested if can check in early, however, our room was still occupied so we requested to leave our things in the hotel instead so we could roam around seminyak. 
I gave four stars so the staff because no one guided us on our way to our room, the staff just gave our room number and room card.  I dont know if its really like that in Bali. Anyway, the facility is very good!  The pool and the rooftop bar plus jacuzzi, oh my god, we really enjoyed it!  
The cleaner staff (though we havent seen them): We would like to thank them for always refreshing up our room. 
Tip: 
On the room TV, you can see the hotel's promos and discounts specially the promos in their restaurant and rooftop bar."
"My husband and me checked in at Daun Bali on 5th August afternoon. The room was very spacious and clean. We went out for dinner around 7pm when the Lombok earthquake happened. Immediately after the first shaking we decided to return to Malaysia. So we return to our room at 5th floor in Daun Bali to pack our stuffs when the second shaking happened. We were shocked and traumatised but luckily the hotel staff were with us and they escorts us until we reach lobby. The staffs were amazing and very halpful. When we cancelled our stay, they informed us to contact Agoda to get the refund. It was an unforgettable moment for us in Bali. The hotel facilities were superb. Unfortunately we were there for about 7 hours only. Thank you to Agoda for refund us the balance two days stay."
"The location is excellent, right in the middle of petitenget and seminyak, 10mins drive to canggu and 30mins from the airport. The room was spacious, sparkly clean, nicely decorated, with a smart TV where you can play music, choose TV channel, order room service, and view and outstanding bills that we need to pay during checkout. 
They also have an option for late checkout till 6PM with a reasonable cost.
Checkin and checkout process was quck and smooth, the staffs were very friendly and attentive. Can’t really complain about anything. The pool didn’t have the best sunlight and there’s no lounging area, but we didn’t choose this hotel because of the pool so that was a compromise that we were ready to make. Also, I wish there was a gym in the hotel. 
Would definitely stay at the Daun again when we’re back in Bali."
"I have a great time stayed at daun hotel seminyak, had a nice room, clean and the room size is very comfortable, near to the place such as nice restaurant and cafe and also for sightseeing place too..i hope i can come back to daun hotel when i have plan to go to bali again..keep up the good work!"
"Bali has always been our favourite relaxing getaway. Stayed in many different types of  hotels and classes. This time round was an impromptu trip for work and we had to keep our budget low. And Daun Bali was the perfect choice! It was value for money and you get more than what you paid for! Good service, location , clean and spacious rooms and there was even quite a large  pool ! 
Enjoyed our stay and will defintely stay here again. Close to many restaurant n cafes like Livingstone, Sardine and wonderful spa just diagonal across the street!"
"Daun Bali was a great hotel! We came without much expectations but the staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The hotel’s jacuzzi and pool was great, food was affordable and good. Room cleanliness was also well taken care of. Overall recommend, will not hesitate to book with them again when I revisit Bali."
"We were stuck for an extended stay due to the volcano and Daun Bali put us up nicely. The staff was great - always ready and willing to assist. They were also able to advise regarding alternatives to getting out of Bali.
This place is good for eateries (lantern Bali, nostimo, monsieur spoon, etc) nearby but not really for shopping.
Wifi wasn’t really stable.
Nonetheless, it’s value for money and will serve its purpose for a good night’s rest if you’re mostly out and about. In fact, it’s pretty good to chill in the room as well."
"It was quite difficult to find it at first, since the signboard was covered by a big tree in front of the hotel.
The location was just perfect, close from anywhere you want to go in Seminyak Area. It was all 10 minutes drive anywhere. The room was quite spacious for 2-3 people. It has a super comfy bed, super comfy and cute couch, and spacious bathroom. In walking distance you can find some cute breakfast spot like Monsiour Spoon, Livingstone, etc. There was also a very nice daily spa spot (Sundari Seminyak) right across the street. I didn’t book for room with breakfasf so i can not comment on that.
If you only want to chill at hotel, they alao have very nice rooftop with Jacuzzi and some beanbags to enjoy the sunset.
I’ve paid the most worth it price for a nice stay in the middle of Seminyak."
"so close / near to the place we want, like something to eat, hangout like coffeeshop or shopping place like jalan kayu aya, petitenget, kuta, sunset road, seminyak market, and near to denpasar, we go shopping and eat for traditional food and items there, so so excited to explore all place near the hotel, and for far away we went to uluwatu market and temple, for the beach very near from hotel that call petitenget beach (more quiet better than kuta beach (crowd everyday) actually the sunset still lovely all bali beach. btw, the hotel was very good and staff is nice n helping more than we need. the food amazing and enough for us. next time we'll come back for sure. thankyou once again🙏"
"I come to Bali many times a year.  But lately been coming here for business, so I have a budget to follow. Daun is the best! Its really value for money. You don't get what you pay for. In fact you get MORE than what you pay for.  It's clean,  staff are great and speak English well.  Rooms are reasonably sized, a big bed. Location is great as there are many restaurants just to the left of the hotel. Stayed here 3 times in 6 months! Love it!"
"It’s really affordable and located in Seminyak, it’s close to everywhere. Good service and comfortable bed. Cleanliness can be better but still I enjoyed my stay in Daun Bali Seminyak. Keep up the good work!"
"This is my first time staying at Daun, the location was strategic, the room was clean, staffs were friendly and helpful. The only downside was the limited parking lot but there was valet services available so it was still handled well. Will definitely stay here again the next time I visit Bali!"
"this is 3rd time to stay at daun seminyak bali.
location is very good and also super clean.
staff are very kindand helpful!"
"i really stay with daun seminyak hotel. very comfy and staffs are kind,friendly also helpful.
this is 3rd stay with this hotel!"
"I was in Bali for 6 days this was by far the best stay I had in Bali. Didn't expect much at first, to my surprise, the room & the toilet was clean.  Thank you Daun! Will definitely stay here again!"
