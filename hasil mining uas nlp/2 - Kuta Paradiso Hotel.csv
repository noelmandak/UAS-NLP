It was an amazing time having to stay in Bali at Kuta Paradiso for a budget trip! The staff and cleanliness of the hotel is incredible and I will definitely recommend anybody who wants to stay in Kuta to book this hotel :-) the staff are really accomodative and will go the extra mile!  Really very grateful
"I have stayed for one night. The room was clean and cosy. Service was quick. Food was amazing. 
Highly recommend"
Friendly receptionist who upgraded our room to a pool view. Breakfast was yummy. The room was comfortable and clean. Close to both beach and the airport. The value for price was great
"my kids love the breakfast menu, stayed there for 4 nights. the staffs are helpfull, even when they had large group to handle on that day."
"Nice hotel, clean, friendly staff, delicioous breakfast with various menu, walking distance to Beachwalk Mall, Discovery Mall, near to the beach..."
"Totally perfect 5 star hotel
Breakfast was great
Staff was great and very helpful and we even got upgraded to suite room for 4 nights
Definitely will come back and stay at this wonderful hotel"
"Hotel is nice and clean, but old."
"Sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. 
Friendly and service oriented stuff ."
"Hotel lama tp tetap terjaga kerapihannya, kebersihan dll lokasinya jg strategis, staff yg ramah, pokoknya the best deh.. next mau staycation disini lagi"
"Nice location for night life ; restaurant, bar, 24 hr store. I call staff to borrow adaptor, and they bring it immediately!"
"We were greeted with a welcome drink at reception,  we booked a deluxe room but were upgraded to a premium pool view room.
The hotel is clean and in a great location with wonderful staff, The breakfast was adequate with many choices, it would have been nice to have been served coffee instead of queuing up for it.  I would most definitely stay there again."
"Me and my family had loads of fun at at this outstanding hotel. We shared lots of amazing memories. We had so many options of what to do. As a mother with 2 children, I always try to make every day amazing for them. And this was the perfect place to do it. The hotel offers many activity’s and we did Bingo at the bar.  This is perfect for tourists to come and go.  And we walked to beach in 10 minutes. 
Almost everything was great -cleaning staff were amazing and it was the most spectacular hotel we have ever been to. I would definitely recommend it to anybody visiting Bali. 👍"
It was amazing. Everything was so comfortable and fantastic
"Hotel was clean. Staff were very friendly. Good variety for breakfast. Great location, beach, shopping centre, bars, variety of restaurants and mini marts all in walking distance."
"the staff were lovely and always happy to help, the breakfast buffet was awesome with lots of food to choose from. The rooms were cozy and had everything you required. 
will definitely be going back there :)"
Good hotel with excellent breakfast!
"We were so happy with our stay. It isn’t the fanciest of places and could do with some TLC after being closed for so long during Covid, but the AMAZING service we had from all the fantastic staff at the hotel and the surrounding bars connected to the hotel was brilliant! They were all so accommodating, kind, genuine and helpful. We formed some fantastic friendships so quickly and we can’t wait to come back to bali and stay with them again!"
I liked enjoying the pool area. The ladies from the spa came out and offered a special promotion on their 1-hour massage. I received one and was very impressed with the quality and atmosphere. The breakfast was also nice - I liked the pasta station. The room had a balcony which I enjoyed. Something in the room comfort felt missing in a 5-star hotel.
Walking distance to Kuta Beach and Hard Rock Cafe. Plenty of restaurants and souvenirs shops within walking.
quiet and comfortable place... the staff are very kindly... a place i would like to come again
"My husband treated me for my birthday. The amazing staff came out singing happy birthday to me with a beautiful  cake, so special. The breakfast  is so Good, a huge variety. The staff, pools, gym,  children's  play area, are amazing.  The hotel is in the best spot ever so central to everything, restaurants,sports bars, watetbomb park, shopping centres.  They have their own information desk to help with tours . A good choice.. loved it"
"Sukaa dgn suasana kamar, bersih, sarapan enak, lokasi strategis, staf ramah, in sya Allah kalo kebali lg nginap disini 👍❤️"
"They have very big swimming pool and it has a good view ,close to kuta beach and beachwalk"
"Stayed here for 4nights. At first, we got the room with the building’s view, quite disappointed but thanks to the wonderful receptionist, she able to transfer us with more splendid view with no charges. Such a variety of breakfast, absolute loves it! The spa in the hotel quite nice and affordable. Everything is awesome especially the beach just 5mins walks from the hotel."
"I have stayed in this Hotel since it first opened.
The staff are fantastic to all of their guests.
I will return again, soon. 😎"
"Could not fault anything with this accommodation.  The location was ideal for our needs, the staff were very friendly & helpful and the facilities I.e Pool, Breakfast and bar were outstanding. I also enjoyed the room service (Value for money and prompt service)."
We delighted to know we were serve halal buffet...in bali tats abit difficult to find a full halal one.
"Good stay , food and location."
On arrival we had a couple of room issues which were sorted out immediately. Breakfast was very good. Exchange rate was very good. Rooms need refurbishment.
I love staying here; excelente service. They helped me a lot with everything. The hotel is in the best area of kuta. I was traveling alone and this location help me a lot
"We stayed for 5 nights in March, 2020 and were very happy with our choice.  The lobby of the hotel is really a standout!   Check in was very easy and our room was a nice size with a very comfy bed.    Kettle, refrigerator, and in room safe are welcome amenities.  The pool area reminds you that you are at a tropical  resort...very nice.  Buffet breakfast had a great selection of western and Asian foods.  Everything we ate was delicious.  Beach access is down a lane beside the resort but very easy to find.  Definitely would stay here again."
"This place is great, it is at the heart of bali, walking distance from the beach and restaurants. Had a great time.."
"Staffs were very kind and helpfull.  The place also clean. 
Recommended place to stay"
"This hotel is attached to a restaurant (B-Couple) that fronts the main strip outside the hotel facility this restaurant is in my opinion the best restaurant in BALI. FOOD IS FANTASTIC, service is great the cleanliness unparalleled I would recommend this Hotel and restaurant to every oncoming to Bali"
"My wife and I have a wonderful time at this hotel, it was very comfortable and reasonably priced with the best breakfast anyone could wish for.  It is idealy located in the heart of kuta, close to many restaurants, a major shopping centre and a short walk to the beach."
"This was my fourth stay at the Kuta paradiso, unfortunately because of Covid somethings weren't available. The massage centre was closed, the buffet breakfast was focused more for the locals and the restaurant was shut. It is not a criticism of the hotel only effects Covid has had on Bali. My first three stays at the Kuta Paradiso were fantastic and I am sure once they are back in full flight it will be again. I would still highly recommend the hotel especially when they get to full patronage again. Good luck Kuta Paradiso"
Just 5 mins walk to kuta beach. Good hospitality.  Buffet variety is very limited. Did not regret booking this hotel.
"It's a good place for the price. We're transiting so just in for 1 night. Close to airport, next to beach, good pool & breakfast"
Recomanded hotel in Bali... Awesome!
"lovely staff ,they go out of there"
Beautiful Staff and Hotel.  Perfect Location.  Amazing Pool.  Couldn't ask for a better place to holiday.
"The staff are working hard to get it back and running after Covid - they were very accommodating and went above and beyond when we had Wi-Fi issues. The pool is great, and the brekky buffet is THE BEST we’ve come across. We are going back in October! Thank you"
Staff are all friendly and trustworthy. We left our safebox unlocked with my jewelry inside and some cash on the table when we went out and find it still there even after the staff make up our room😀😀  great service and great breakfast buffet😆😆
"I have been to Bali multiple times and I have always stayed in Kuto Pradiso if i stay in Kuta.
Worth the money !!"
Recommend hotel if u come to Bali👍
"Stayed at the Kuta Paradiso for 1 week for the first time. Although in need of some maintenance after Covid, the hotel was very clean and all amenities were available. The staff were great and could not do enough for us. Location is good for those wanting to be in the centre of Kuta close to restaurants and shops such as Discovery Mall and Beachwalk."
"An old hotel with prime location
Rating 7.5 / 10"
I will recommed to other to book this property
"The hotel is nice. The staff is great, But the hotel management don't care about the customers. We stay there for 30 days and had some problems in the room throughout our stay. Staff was happy to help but was waiting on management for the go ahead. The management would take up to hours  before doing anything. Also one night the management took a booking for a party and had it in the restaurant that was all open air in the middle of the hotel instead of in the enclosed ballroom that didn't finish until after midnight. We heard from staff that all guests complain  throughout the night"
"Staff are excellent rooms very clean some maintenance mainly the wood railings on the balcony
Pool needs some parts fixed but was  still nice to use  around the  pool  needed a lot off work done hopefully now tourist are there they can do more 
I wouldn’t  pay precovid prices yet 
We enjoyed our stay there and I can’t mention enough how great the staff are everyone always greeted you with a smile they all did their best to make sure each and everyone had a great holiday"
"I/we have stayed here several times.
Good location, good breakfast and nice staff.
My only negative is that the bed linens and towels were stained."
"We loved staying at Kuta.  Beautiful people, the pool was a big hit with the kids. I’m missing the breakfast. We are returning next year and bringing the rest of the family."
"Location is good, price reasonable and clean"
I will give it 5 stars if your wifi is available in my room! Wifi is slow in the lobby and the choice of food for breakfast is lesser than expected. But the staff is friendly and very kind. Love to stat here. Love much is they have FREE airport transfers which are very convenient for me. Thanks for this stay
great location and value for money
great stay great staff
"This property is a bit away from the beach but quite at the center of Kuta.
They do provide free pickup from airport which is helpful.
The staff is very warm and welcoming. The hotel seems to be a bit old but is in good condition. There is no direct access to be beach from hotel but via a lane besides it."
Massages where very professional!!
Nice hotel..
"Wonderful staff, needs a bit of maintenance,  gym ok and breakfast had a great variety.   Would not rate it as a 5 star though?  Older rooms in ground level had a musty , mouldy smell but they happily moved us to level 2 and rooms were much cleaner smelling."
"Nice size rooms.  Good breakfast, clean rooms.
The gym equipment was not working, needs replacing."
"old hotel need to be modernized, but have great location"
"After dealing with a pandemic this hotel has really pulled through! Yes there are signs of a little wear and tear, but the staff are always working to fix up all the rooms and bring it back to what it was in the past.  Everyone is super friendly and I will totally be staying here again!"
"Booked this place for few days to get settled after arriving. 
Few notes below:
It's a busy, clean hotel with very attentive staff! Breakfast buffet has a variety of items and definitely worth it if you don't want to leave the hotel first thing in the morning. 
Hotel is older than it looks on the photos and it smells a little damp, however since humidity is sky high in January it's pretty much the norm in Bali and the property has a massive pool at the back after-all. Most of the Gym equipment was out of order which was disappointing.
Overall a perfect place for a stopover."
"Cozy old hotel but minus wifi connection. 
I've stay for abt 5 days in Kuta Paradiso. Wifi in room 322 was very bad. I should request sandal for stay there cause they no provide it. The wastafel flood need to repair too when i was there.  No direct to the beach should by go out to the street first. quit bored Breakfast for 5 stay there. Staff is OK"
"The hotel needs some work around the place. We changed rooms as the air conditioner was not coping! This is my second stay and I'd go back. Although it is listed as 5 Star, it is not 5 Star by Australian standards.  Having said that, it is still a great place to stay and I will be back. Beware of the money changer 50 metres away (next to Tourist Police) Although it is in a glass doored room and apparently more trustworthy, he wasn't.. he swiped 80K Rupia (AUD80) when my husband looked in his pocket for small notes.  Husband went back within 5 minutes and said ""You owe me some money"" He had the money there and gave it straight back!  Beware! All in all, still love BALI!"
"Clean Room & good Breakfast
Nice swimming pool
GYM is under maintenance
Traffic jam in kuta is worse
Kuta Beach is very dirty now"
"Well located at kuta beach, staff is very polite and helpful"
"Good breakfast, comfortable bed and room, friendly staff, good location, gym and pool"
good location
Cuma pesan kamar type dulax di kasih kamar yg berbeda.alasan nya kamar full boking.
"Breakfast variety was amazing with a delicious selection.  
Hotel is a bit aged but well maintained.  Bathroom could do with an upgrade as the drains seemed to be blocked (which house keeping did unblock on request). We were in the Family room with direct pool access, which the kids loved. Pool is a bit deep for young kids however very nice. 
Very centrally located in vibrant Kuta, close to beach, Waterbom, mall and heaps of food options at your doorstep. Staff are very welcoming and helpful."
Nice location & great service
Good location good hotel worth the money
"Great location etc, in need of an uplift"
"Free transfer airport to and from hotel with a friendly welcome and drink. Hotel is in a great location with good facilities, and a fantastic breakfast.
We read a lot of reviews and yes it does need a little bit of a touch up here and there but it’s Bali and you get what you pay for. We would definitely stay again"
i've been staying in this hotel for more than 3 times and the staff quite friendly and all the facilities is really good
"Great Old Hotel - restaurants etc are shut due to covid 
Large rooms but showing age"
"Breakfast is superb, for 10!!Room is enough big.Near beach.Nice staff and very helpful.I like because offering for free transportation from airport, for me that was main things why i choose this hotel."
"Great & convenient location, near Kuta Beach...
Old hotel but still well maintained.
Not sure whether it's due to our bedsheet or not , but after first day , our bodies are full of bumps ..."
The food is excellent and the staff very helpful and friendly.
"Nice place to stay and really good value for money. Staff were amazing but a little quite in Kuta now.  Buget hotel, could do with abit of TLC but certainly nice and clean. Excellent pool and enjoyed our stay."
"The staff at Paradiso defines hospitality. They are ever ready to help and ensure that the guests are well taken care of. The hotel premises is huge but well maintained and clean. Great place especially for young families because the pool and the kids play area will engage the kids giving some ""me time"" to parents."
Beer in pool area not cold enough
"We like the location and the pickup from the airport is great.
Reception was friendly as were the rest of the staff we will definitely stay there again when the coronavirus is under control"
"Location, friendly staff and great services provided by the hotel! 
We will be back!"
"The rooms and pool are very good & good value. No room service & minimal food at breakfast. 
At the moment the hotel rooms are like small apartments which are adequate but was not fully expected. 
Would consider returning when operating fully."
THIS IS A 3 STAR HOTEL BUT THE SERVICE IS 5 STAR
"First off, the hotel offers free shuttle pick and drop at the nearby Airport. However, it seems like most hotels will like you to have reservation confirm such as flight information to ensure you are picked-up on time. The biggest downfall was that I reached out the the hotel and Agoda via email way in advance about 7-8 times (total). Unfortunately, I did not get clear confirmation on where to meet the shuttle/ driver. This was very inconvenient because after a long  flight all I needed was some sort of certainty on how to get to my reserve hotel and recuperate. I had to spend money on taxi. Even after leaving the customs, I told the taxi driver I need to double check if the driver from the hotel way waiting for me. And to my surprise, the taxi was not aggressive and pushy to make money, he simply helped me look for my name on all the plaques of several greeters and we did not find my name."
"I requested for a high level and a nice view for our second honey moon. But a room was given to us is on the 1st level and a concrete wall view🤨 
I did remind them on our request and gave us a courtesy to change our room to level 5 with a better balcony view without extra charge. 👍👍"
"Staff were great, Especially the staff at the pool bar. Went above and beyond. 
Amenities are aged and tired, All functional. To be expected post two years without use during the pandemic. 
Overall, If you are looking for a cheap sleep i would recommend."
"Beautiful foya area, nice breakfast, staff were helpful, room was clean but a bit dated. The pool area is beautiful.
Not direct exit from the hotel to beach, 
Had to walk around the block to get to it.
Heaps of good choices for food in this area."
"Very convenient, clean and safe. Just 5 mins walk to Kuta beach with lots of shopping and shops around. Highly recommended stay!"
"Good locations, good breakfast options, friendly staff, small pool bar"
"I love the hotel and had been staying a few times. I think it is time the hotel management think of renovating the room and upgrade the service and maintenance, in-order to remain as favorite hotel..."
"This hotel is a great place to stay due to its location. It is a bit rundown with both our rooms having issues with lights and aircon. The pool is nice but handrails are rusty and loose. The breakfast is awesome but don’t have dinner in the restaurant. We where the only people in and it took them an hour to make a pizza and chips, and then the chips came after we had eaten the pizza. Check in was slow and we had to wait for 2 hours. Others also had this issue. If you just want a room close to the markets and eating region it is a good place to stay."
"Near airport with great swimming pool, most of the services was impacted by the Pandemic this time around, otherwise this remains a very convenient and well priced hotel."
The whole resort was big. Walking distance to many eateries & shops. The range of food for breakfast was amazing & unexpected. Big pool & had a small kids club/room. The rooms were a bit old & dated.
"The hotel looks old, some spot not good looking"
"Very near to Kuta beach. 
Also you will be able find shopes nearby like bike rent, sim, travel planners. 
They also provide Airport cab . The driver was available before time and was vey convenient to reach hotel."
Can't really fault the hotel except for the wifi was really non-existent where we were on the 5th floor.
The breakfast wasn’t very good. No western food and my Indonesian wife didn’t think the breakfast was too good either.
"Everything is good,I want to stay here again."
"Location wise for me is just nice. Room was ok, looks abit run down, bt staffs were nice and friendly."
"good location
best breakfast selection at this bali hotel
pool is lovely
rooms neat and clean"
Quite old vibes. Bed is nice. Room is big. Water taste weird. Breakfast is average.
I think the poolbar should be open later at night
Beautiful reception and lobby area. Bell hop was wonderful and helpful; check in was smooth. The rooms can use some updating; shower was clogged and bathroom needs a good cleaning. Pool/koi ponds outside were beautiful; easy walking distance to marketplace and walking streets!
"The location is very good. Short walk to Kuta beach, Discovery mall. Hotel is comfortable although slightly dated. Very recommended afterall."
Emailed from Agoda to confirm “Breakfast” booked but Hotel did not know about it. Customer has shown Hotel staff with the confirmation code then took nearly 20 minutes late to complete the agreement.
"The property quiet old, needed more recative maintenance and replacement of damages including shower pressure."
Everything was pretty good.  I thought breakfast was over priced and not that anything in Bali is really expensive but it just wasn't every good for what was paid and expected. Also depending which side of the hotel your sleeping on you might get a ton of noise from the bars and the street. This kept me up all night one night. Other than that it was decent
"Stay 3 night
Positive =
- Staf helpfull and upgrade my room
- Room big with nice pool view
- Breakfast varian
Location only 5 minute walk to kuta beach"
"suitable price, good location"
"This is the 2nd time I have stayed here. At check in, ask which side does not have the band blaring all night as this seems to be the side I am assigned to. The staff were useless, no ear plugs given but they suggested at 11pm that I wake my 4 yr old son, pack all my bags up and move to the other wing! Why you would even put families on this side I don't know. The band is so loud that you may as well be in the bar having a drink. 
If you are put in the quiet area of the hotel then this hotel is slightly outdated as in décor, but it has fantastic pool areas, a small kids room and the best breakfast I've had yet in Bali. Outstanding. 
I would stay here again but only if I was in the good side."
"In October the hotel atmosphere is very quiet and the staff are few, lack of security and places to eat"
It’s the second time we’ve  stayed there great location the pool is awesome but it’s getting a bit long in the tooth the rooms need a revamp but overall we were happy with our stay there
"Good pool, awesome breakfast but horrible view from the room balcony."
"the building is extremely, and  the facilities and services are outdated.
however, the location is perfect and values for monies.
definitely a great hotel for your basic hotel expectation and purposed"
"Loved the pool at this hotel. But due to the virus and travel restrictions the pool activities didnt go ahead as they said not enough people but one day there would have been but they didnt even ask if anyone was interested.
Love the location, central to everything in Kuta. Room was nice. Would definately stay here again if it was value for money."
"The hotel is in a very good location and that was the reason we have stayed here.
The staff are nice, the check in and check out process was fast and easy but the hotel rooms really need an update. The furniture has signs of use as well as the toilet.
The pool is ok, with same shades.
The breakfast is average."
Very strategic for people who want to go around kuta. Hotel is old but well maintained.
"The overall impression was midrange, not a 5* at all. Especially old furniture, ambiance and motivations of staff.  This is true that the location is excellent! Roaming around with kids was good with a lot of halal restaurant options."
The hotel is at good location but need upgrade to keep up 5 star hotel standards
"Good location rooms need to be refurbished.  Suite rooms not good value for money and can be very noisy depending which area of the Hotel.
Staff very good."
"the property needs an urgent upgrade. we have styaed at this property on a few occasions previously but it is now due an upgrade. 
most queries with the front desk and the reply was the same. it is under maintenance. could not book on their website"
"Very dated, not a hot shower, luke warm, staff were great, breakfast great."
"Good location and hotel provide transfer to airport. the staff were very friendly - we were given an upgrade because we stayed twice in the hotel. The location was superb, and you can walk to the beach and eating places just along the street from the hotel and get a good massage. Unfortunately, there were some constructions to access to beach and the hotel is old but manageable"
The hotel and staff were very nice and very clean but it did not have any beach access or facilities
"The hotel is tired, the balconies are noisy and the restaurants are still closed. 
The staff are very friendly, the wifi is useless for business"
"Staff is not helpful at all upon check in or checkout, rooms are small , food is below average, the good thing they have big pools which is good for children"
Old hotel with under maintenance
wifi is poor
Kindly confirm to Agoda for my cash back return . Thanks for quick action
Pool good breakfast good room not good for 5 star hotel
Old but location is good
The hotel look liked 3 star not 5 star. Breakfast buffet not many choices.
"Although the hotel room style is very nice, the curtains had visible stains, the kettle provided by the hotel had stains/rust that had to be washed out and the bathtub was covered in slight dirt and dust. The floor was not very well cleaned - when I walked on the floor barefoot my feet became a little black due to the dirt that had not been cleaned on the floor. The bed, however, was completely clean. and comfy to use."
The hotel location is very convenient for shopping and dining since it is located in central area of Kuta. WiFi system is terrible since I could not connect internet in the room due to very low signal intensity of WiFi. I faced many mosquitos attack in the restaurant on breakfast.
"Pros: good location & nice staff
Cons: old hotel, furniture & bath tub. Find that it’s quite pricey and not like 5-star hotel."
this hotel may have been highly rated 20 years ago.the condition is very run down bedding furniture all from the 1990s
We had a pleasant stay.
Pls renovate the hotel
"Good location
Old furnished hotel
Facilities so so"
Hotel definitely effected by lack of tourism. Looks so amazing online but is obviously in need of many visitors to return it to its former glory. Staff were amazing but not enough people staying to open facilities.  Staff were lovely and helpful
The hotel need full renovation. The front desk staff need a well training because the staff assisted us that night had forgotten to tell us the procedures to book the complimentary transport to airport.
Location is good. Avoid ground floor - water in toilet & shower smells.
"The second room had a stained under blanket and when I requested it to be changed the staff said yes but it was never changed. The aircon did not work and the room was very warm, I informed reception and maintenance cleaned the aircon unit and stated it was then working but the temperature had not changed. Initially I was told it was because I had the drapes open with the patio door closed, but that was a ridiculous excuse because after that comment and the unit cleaned the room was still warm the following morning  after I set the aircon temp on 16 degrees and the fan on high in the previous afternoon. I found the majority of the staff great except the night reception on the 14/01 and the maintenance staff who failed to fix the aircon. I have traveled to Bali many many times and this was the first and last stay at your hotel, I will be informing as many people as possible of my disappointing stay."
Ok nothing special. We stayed in a ground room that opened into the pool the rooms smelt very old and had mould on the curtains. It was just average
"I stayed 2 night at the hotel.Free airport pick up service was good.Room is clean ,but roomlight suddenly blackout."
"Staying here For 2 night , with price that not cheap. The hotel was looked Like Going to closed , the Staff is Nice , got upgrade 1 class , pool not working , breakfast Just Get box lunch.
Beside that , the hotel near Kuta beach , Better stay at villa more worth it"
Just ok but not highly recommended. Old hotel & a lot of things not functioning well in the room. WIFI slow
"Nice pool.good location. 
Rooms are very old and outdated it feels Like two star. 
We didn't feel the presence of hotel staff.
Breakfast had a variety but almost the same everyday."
Very old and tired
"Glad I only stayed here one night.  
Location is good, close to beach and airport.   Room smelled like sewage on the 5th floor.  Room looked like it was in desperate need of refurbishment.  
I’m surprised it is rated 5 star.  I’ve stayed in much nicer 3/4 stars.  
Definitely not worth the price."
"The room was dirty and in need of a paint 
Everything felt dirt to touch 
The linen and towels were grey and needed replacement 
The floor was dirty and needed mopping 
I was seriously waiting to see rats in the room 
I have stayed in better budget rooms"
"not 4 or 5 star 
just 3 star level"
Not a 5 stars hotel at all
"No pick up from airport. Stinky room. And they dont know how to take care customer!
Never going back."
"Definitely was not a 5 star property. Staff were rude, could not find my booking and were not accommodating. Property was out dated and the rooms were not very clean.
We stayed at the Parma for 5 days before this which was such a wonderful experience."
"The hotel provides airport transport round trip unfortunately, no one pick us up and when I reach the hotel I complained, they upgraded my room. I thought it will be a nice compensation, but the room never made any difference and is so shitty.  The bed is like sleeping in a pothole. The hotel stated 5 stars and it less than a 3 stars hotel.  Hotel is old and not well maintained. The swimming pool area is dirty and around the pool are wet and mouldy. Never in my life not enjoying myself in a swimming pool. This is my first time, I only hang around 30 min out of 5 days stay. The entire hotel only has aircon in the rooms. We can't even enjoy our breakfast sweating all the way. We have to rush eating and get back to our room.  Surprisingly, the hotel also not connected to the beach. We have to walk out of the hotel and cross a small lane to get to the beach.  Internet is very very slow. When we check out, we were not informed that we have to get their shutter bus according to time schedule"
Better agoda crosscheck realtime about the hotel
This hotel is a far cry from 5 star...…  I ordered I pizza from room service and there were to completely RAW eggs cracked on top.  I tried to call room service back straight after  and the phone rang out.  On check out in the morning I advised I was not happy to pay for this as it was inedible.   The pizza was left in the room with one piece eaten which was disgusting and had no raw egg on it.  They refused to remove the charge (it was never about the money $5.00) they asked the staff to  bring the pizza downstairs to the checkout counter and after 15 minutes of waiting and discussing the issue the Manger decided to give us 50% off the cost of the Pizza.  A very  poor and unacceptable result.
"Cleanliness not great 
Electrical problems with lighting
Bad odor in room
Not well maintained"
"Ordered the room service, not only far to expensive for what is served. ended up getting food poisoning and had to spend the next 24 hours in the hotel."
"i brought my parents for a 4d3n trip to bali for the first time and been looking for a suitable hotel and this was a last minute trip so i actually booked this hotel a day before arriving after going through several selection of hotels. kuta paradiso hotel is amazingly located at the most strategic location nearby kuta square and lots of eating outlets stone throw away. though the poolview indicates that you are able to see the beach, but in reality the scenery of the beach is well blocked by tall trees, so if you're getting deluxe poolview, expect just the poolview and nothing more. nevertheless, it is just by the beach, you can access to the beach through a side exit of the hotel (as you walk out of the lobby, immediately turn left to an area that looks like parking lot and you will find an exit). hotel has full facility, staffs from reception to bellboy to waiter/waitress were all very warm and welcoming, kudos for the very polite culture! the room is up to my expectation as what i would get of a deluxe room, and that comes with free buffet breakfast which has reasonable selection of american/local breakfast...the potato hashbrown simply the best! exit from the hotel, you will walk through kuta square and reaching a t-junction you may decide to turn left towards the road along kuta beach, or turn right to access to other roads namely legian street. you will get familiar on the first day itself so enjoy ;)"
"The Kuta Paradiso Hotel was very nice with excellent facilities and a fantastic breakfast buffet (best we had in Indonesia)!  I was a bit disappointed with the location of our room within the hotel (1st floor located above a bank of HVAC units that were loud and hot when outside on the balcony), but the room itself was fine.  Location of the hotel is great, very close to the beach, a large market and central to tons of restaurants and shops.  Too bad Kuta itself has become such a non-descript tourism ghetto.  Nothing to do with the Kuta Paradiso Hotel, but I would not stay in Kuta again, I would look for a hotel near one of the other local beaches (e.g., Echo Beach) that are less crowded and still retain some Balinese character.  There's nothing ""Bali"" about Kuta, unfortunately..."
"Overall the family and myself could not fault much at all. The staff, location and breakfast was awesome. If I I had to fault anything it would be the something minor as the wifi throughout the hotel. I know this is a bonus having it but after a big day out all you want to do is to kick back with a cold beer or drink and check your emails or anything like that and with poor connection within the room I had to go out into the breezeway or verandah just to get decent reception without dropping out. 
The Kuta paradiso is deffanettely a great place to stay for families or as a couple. As a family we had a ball and what was awesome was the location, being so central deffanettely has its advantages when you have young kids who aren't a fan of walking and its position within the Kuta region is great. 5 mins stroll to the 2 major shopping centres and the main markets right next door is so good if you feel like going out but can't be bothered travelling to far. This hotel gives you that option of heading out and not having to catch taxis just to do some shopping.
Overall I would give this hotel Kuta paradiso a solid 9 out of 10 and most deffanettely be looking to stay here again in the future."
"This is our first time staying in Kuta Paradiso. We stayed for 1 week and really enjoyed our time. The hotel itself is a bit old, but the staff and the service are beautiful. We had a bit of problem with the aircon noise when we checked in, but the staff immediately find us another room. Love the buffet breakfast, so many choices and the attention to details are excellent in the restaurant, such a feast in the eye. Staff are also very nice and always smile. First time to experience a hotel that hold an event/game for the guest. We really enjoyed the event as we already traveled to Bali many times, and this time we decided just to stay in and around the hotel. So, the hotel activity is really something different for us. Love the pool which so green and has tropical feeling. Thank you to Bapak Warta (in the restaurant) always service with a smile. And also Ibu Ayu (helped us to find another room with a quiet aircon & even transfered our suitcase by herself to our new room). Thumb up to the hotel creative team that creates the event for the hotel guest."
"our stay was fantastic, from the moment we arrived we sincerely felt welcome. i have stayed in bali many times and this is most likely the best hotel i have stayed in. very good value for money, good size room, comfortable and very close proximity to centre of kuta and everything you want in bali. buffet breakfast was excellent and the staff were very attentive and happy. security staff were friendly and overall i really enjoyed my time at kuta paradiso. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. there are several seperate pools, kids club and many activities to entertain at the hotel as well."
"This is my 3rd time staying in the hotel. Room was well serviced, though looking a little old now, could use a lick of paint.
The breakfast is superb. lunches & dinners at the B couple bar are also wonderful and decent price. Ask at the hotel counter for more 10% discount cards. 
The pool is wonderful, 3 different levels, with a more private smaller section if you want to cannoodle with your partner. but I don't advise buying drinks at the pool bar - they are too expensive.
I have two lovely friends that I met here back in 2009 in my first trip to Bali; Sujana & Leong. Its always great to see them and they are always happy to help with any query you may have as are all the staff at the Kuta Paradiso. I cannot wait to go again!"
"The staff at Kuta Paradiso are the most friendliest and nicest people we have had the pleasure to meet. My husband & I have been to Bali over the last 10 years and have stayed at many hotels but the staff here surpass any other hotels we have been to. In the dining room we're Wayan Sumatra, Kasi Larose and Narti Andahna. I am guessing they were client service staff, but made every aspect of our stay enjoyable. They were all so friendly and very informative for all aspects of the hotel and also Kuta. They are a credit to the hotel. Also a big mention to the young men and young girl who serviced our room daily. I did not manage to get their names but they were also so friendly and did a great job. We would definately stay here again! Rozanne and David Walsh"
"Overall experience is to be summarised in one word: Amazing!
I love the details of attention provided upon check in (wet towels & welcome drinks), plus how friendly & helpful all staff have been during my stay. All staff from reception, housekeeping, f&b and even technical support smiles & greet guests wholeheartedly.
One of the reason we keep on coming back here is the delicious buffet breakfast. Outstanding spread selection from local Indonesian to western delicacies. Most appreciaton needs to be awarded to bakery department. Kuta Paradiso has the best bread ever.
Second addictive experience is the outstanding swimming pool. My kid love the size & how it comes is different levels.
Best splurge we always look forward to is the Jalanidi Spa. The great ambience & trained massage therapist would always be our memorable souvenir before going back to Singapore.
Keep it up Kuta Paradiso! We hope you remain to be everybodys favorite ;)
On a side note, I hope the following could be improved.
The bathroom door at room 170 is a bit difficult to close. We have to make an effort to slam it a bit or push it hard to make it shut. It also makes a loud ""creek"" sound when it opens.
Thank you & hope to see you again soon."
"We booked 5 rooms total for a 5 nights at the Kuta Paradiso, and enjoyed everyday. From the free airport pickup to the drop-off. 
The breakfast was well appointed, with a few changing items each day for variety. The pool was also very beautiful and we enjoyed relaxing there a few nights. It really is as nice as the photos. 
The location was also quite central in Kuta, next to many restaurants and shops. I recommend the Italian restaurant/ American pub right across from the hotel for some good reasonably priced lunch/ dinner. 
I would definitely stay here again"
"I had a very great stay at the Kuta Paradiso Hotel, very lovely place to stay. I want to compliment the staff, because they are on top of their game every single day, very friendly, everyone would either smile or say hello and its nice, especially when you are on vacation, to receive happy greetings like that. Room was serviced every day (though there wasn't a set time when they would come by) always left it clean and fresh. I loved the amenities most, such as the free breakfast ( which they have a variety of), cable tv, and most of all the pool, they also provide free drop offs at the airport. The only downside was that there Wi-fi didn't work (i managed to get connection maybe once or twice), but overall a lovely place to stay."
"We had a great time at the Kuta Paradiso Hotel, so great that we stayed there 3 times over the past 7 weeks. From now on it will be our hotel of choice in Kuta. It is close to shopping, Starbucks, has an airport shuttle,and the staff is great. The beds are clean and comfortable, and the breakfasts are great. The hotel is showing some signs of wear and tear like many older hotels but the overall effect is one of charm, not neglect. The beach walk mall is only a 5 minute walk or a two minute taxis ride, plus you are one minute from the beach. Its a perfect Kuta Beach location. I would highly recommend it."
"Absolutely amazing place to stay. We stayed at the Paradiso Hotel for 12 days (2 adults, 7 year old and 3 year old) in a family room consisting of 2 queen beds. Kids loved the kids club and its friendly staff members. Breakfast was delicious and the staff are simply wonderful and helpful. Pool is amazing and has activities for all ages. Volleyball / basketball / table tennis / kids pool. Gym right opposite the kids club so you can keep an eye out on your kids while your training if you love your excercise and keeping fit. Food & beverages were fairly priced considering it's a highly rated hotel. Security is great, location is fantastic and we will be recommending this hotel to all our friends and families for future Bali holidays."
We have traveled the world my wife and self and now after many years and hotels have found a a hotel which has many of the requirements we are after. The food selection is great from breakfast thru to dinner in the restaurants but also the many restaurants that are in easy walking distance. The staff are very friendly and helpfull attentive in all questions asked if unable to get answer straight away they will always come back with the help you need. I would like to signal out one staff member Ruth the Guest Relation Officer she was always friendly and ready to help with any question. But also the other staff members were also friendly and helpful. I will be staying at the Paradiso next visit. A great family hotel yet a hotel you can relax in. Thank you Paradiso for our wonderful holiday we will be seeing you again. The bottom question is what type of holiday you are having and looking for if wild or a little on the risk side the answer is POOR to FAIR if in a group FAIR to GOOD ours as we saw it was VERY GOOD as marked. We felt very safe in the section of Kuta we sayed in.
"We have traveled to Bali since 1988 and this is our first stay at the Kuta Paradiso.  We loved our 2 night stay in the Romantic suite, a beautiful room with a king sized bed, large tub and separate shower with great water pressure and warm water, as well as a two ocean view balconies, one with a jacuzzi.  The hotel was very well maintained, ac in the room worked great, staff was friendly and competent, check in and check out was fast, the pool area was great, and the breakfast buffet was very nice.   We will definitely stay here again and will recommend to our friends."
"i have visited bali many many times and kuta paradiso is amazing value , its a bright hotel , the service is above average , the pool is beautifully lit in the evening , from my poolview room at night i could hear the waves breaking from kuta beach. i will revisit this hotel when next staying in kuta . check in and check out was fast and very easy . i loved my stay and recommend this hotel . a happy guest sally"
"After a number of trips to Bali, we decided, to stay a few days in Kuta, then move out to Seminyak, we were so pleased with our choice of the Kuta Paradiso, once inside hotel, hectic outside forgotten.  Very good value for money, breakfast buffet nice, with lots of choices. Staff friendly and helpful.    Pool smallish but clean, good pool drinks service. Food at pool bar good.
Great proximity to Discovery Centre, Matahari, and markets,  excellent restaurants just outside hotel.
Pleasantly surprised with hotel for what we paid. 😀"
"We had a great time at the Kuta Paradiso.  We would recommend it without reservation . The staff is great, smooth and easy check in and check out. The pool and bar is wonderful. Breakfast was amazing. The staff has great language skills and are so attentive and efficient they make you feel like a valued guest. We have been to Bali many times and feel that we have finally found a hotel that we will return to many times. We can't wait to return. Location, value, comfort, wonderful food and great service. It has it all."
"i have visited bali many many times , this hotel wins my vote , location is fantasic . the customer service is well above average. i love that this is a bright , breezy hotel , with a beautifully lit up pool area in the warm evening . the waves from kuta beach i could hear from my poolside room bonus . i am happy to recommend kuta paradiso ."
"I spent three nights here. The service was friendly enough, although check in a little bit longer because the room is not yet ready. Spacious room and clean. and also amazing swimming pool.
Extremely superb location, in the center of Kuta Beach. Just take 5 minutes walking to the magnificent beach.
For sure, I'll stay at Kuta Paradiso Hotel when coming back again to This God's Island. Thanks U Agoda...."
best place to stay as we keep coming back its was our 3 rd time now at kuta paradiso hotel and we find its hard to compare with other hotels around kuta  for a over all  value ..... money /cleanliness/staff /and pool with a great bar and best fast bar staff........... we love it ..........mr alan and linda thanks for another great stay  kuta paradiso .
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Kuta Paradiso, we had travelled most of the day and were just longing to be settled in our room and were not disappointed, our room was large and well appointed, the bathroom was large and there was plenty of room to spread ourselves out. The pool was large and beautifully landscaped and the staff were around the pool area looking to take orders for food/beverages. The location of the hotel was also very good, with many good restaurants very close by. Also the hotel provided a shuttle bus to the airport, which was very handy."
Such as title said
"What impressed me most was the staff.
I want to thank everyone especially the two girls at the reception the day we were to fly back home.
One of my friends was not feeling well.
They organised free transfer to the hospital immediately.It was nothing serious and we got back home without missing the flight.
They attended to  all our needs.
A special Thanks to the manager in the breakfast area.He welcomed all of us with a smile on his face as if we were his family.
Thanks again for the wonderful ten days in beautiful Bali."
It was a great hotel but no maintenance has happened since coronavirus . Now it’s  customers are buses  from Indonesia different countries arriving for one day stopover. Yet the price doesn’t reflect anything of the old Paradiso.so sad to see a good hotel  destroyed. A long time customer of the Paradiso
The location itself is very convenient to all.  Staffs are also friendly and very accommodating. 5 star for us!
"Love the place, love the hotel, love the staffs and the people in Bali as they are very kind and courteous! Would love to come back soon for next holidays!"
"This Hotel require a facelift, too old… and Lobby not enough lighting."
Eventhought the building’s old but the all the facilities upgraded.. nice staying
Near with Kuta beach.
Very Nice Hotel with good location . The Buffet Breakfast is good having variety of options for Vegetarians also. We enjoyed the hotel during our stay.
"If your travelling on a budget,  and value for money I would stay here.
Yeah there is lots of imperfections , but if you can get past that I would stay here. The rooms are clean , breakfast is good. The location is close to everything you need . The pool area was the best, and I must say the staff. Mu honest review is stay here, if you want to save money on your accommodation,  because the majority of your time will be spent exploring Bali."
Everything is ok
Good luxury hotel in budget somtimes
Highly recommended
Strategic location
Best location in Bali. Next to beach and the place is really good. I was a solo traveller. Nice place to stay with family as well.
Great location
Little peice of paradise in kuta perfect location close to beach and shopping friendly faces everyday everywhere I'd definitely stay again the pools are just amazing and the sound of wateralling is meditation for your soul
"Hotel is nice, clean and room very spacious. Breakfast was large and well done. Staff was above and beyond accommodating.
However, the deal breaker for me was the water pressure in the shower as well as sink. If you want a shower with warm water control of the temperature from very hot to cold on about a 10 second interval is not possible either with hand held wand or shower head. Staff move me to a different room and it was little different. He acknowledged that this was an issue throughout. If this does not affect you, go for it, otherwise nice place. For me after a long flight from I wanted a nice warm shower."
"Amazing hotel, very friendly staff, very clean, delicious buffet breakfast and in a very central place for walking and beach. Excellent room next to the pool. Pool is lovely. Will stay here again 😃"
I booked this hotel for my staff who went there for his Honeymoon. He was very happy with the service given and he was upgraded to a honeymoon suite. Highly recommending as it is situated at a very good location too.
"We reserved 2 rooms an got a free upgrade when we showed up to check in. The rooms are nice but a little dated but very clean. The staff was great an very helpful in everything we needed. The Buffett was nice nothing to exciting but food was fresh with a decent variety. Also if you wont bacon with your morning meal you  hav to ask the staff attending the egg counter. As its not out on display.  The location doesn't have beach access but its just a little walk down the street to the left or right of the hotel. Talking about location the hotel is right in the middle of everything so you can walk to the mall, beach, shopping, convince stores  an really nice restraunts."
"Stayed at Kuta Paradiso great value for money, buffet breakfast was huge! Pools were great and plenty of sun beds!"
"Yes an older hotel but beautiful maintained and run. Staff exceptional. Rooms super clean and comfy , showers great. Brekky really good variety 
Will be back"
"Big, comfortable room. Amazing breakfast every morning. (You must try their Indonesian food section.) Great location at Kuta. Also got complimentary massage for two. What else could you ask for? :)"
Receptionist could have been better

Location easy and great for anything you need . Hotel is older however clean and maintained . Staff just wonderful .. breakfast was really good . Rooms super comfy and modern and shower the best we have had in Bali !
"Great breakfast, great location"
"Old and tired hotel. Not 5* as advertised. Used to be a great place back in 1999, but not anymore."
"Good close to Airport, but far from other hot spots. Problem that transportation in Bali makes this even more painful."
Best best best
It was nice stay in the hotel.
