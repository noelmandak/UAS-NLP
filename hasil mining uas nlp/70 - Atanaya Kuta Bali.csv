"Stayed here for 3 nights. Rooms were clean and well maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. The pool on 6th floor was well maintained as well. Sunset view is great !! 
Just one suggestion. Need more variation on the daily breakfast menu pls. Rest all is 5/5."
"Such a nice hidden gem, I've stayed here many times and it never disappoints, the staff are the best and one of the reasons I always come back.
Great location if you're mobile, don't want to stay near a night club  and have a bike or transport"
"The location is good by the main road and close from the shopping area, easy to go to anywhere.
Room is quite cozy & clean.
But Food is terrible & WiFi is not working well. Hopefully can be improved to make more comfortable staying."
Best hotel with a good price .!!!
"The hotel room is great, clean and comfort. But i heard noisy from the next room and the room above me it make me sleepless.. The breakfast is not complete, I know the condition is not normal now. But your hotel didn't served any omelette or sausage. I cannot eat rice in the morning, I only had Rice poridge and 2 pieces of bread. You have to understand... Not all people able to eat rice in the morning."
"This hotel hv a good price, clean, hot water, AC, glass swimming pool.  I will come back to stay here agai."
"hotelnya bersih, lokasi strategis, staff ramah, vibes hotel nyaman bgt 😍"
the hotel is quite good for that price. Very recommended.
location strategic
"Managed to get a room at 16SGD. Def worth it. Staff is nice and friendly. They can help settle your laundry too, it smells really nice. But of course at a price that’s well worth :)"
The staff was so nice
All the staff very helpful and friendly
The best place to stay and enjoy!!!👍🏻
"makanan nya enak, pelayanannya bagus, staffnya ramah, ruangannya bersih"
Bersih adem nyaman
Service excellent
Comfy stay. Staff is accommodating. This is my second stay.  Value for money.
"Room was standard, clean and  comfortable. Food was good. Staff friendly with efficient good service. Roof top pool was amazing, but Bintang could have been colder and it would be perfect 😉🙂"
Keep up the good work
All good Ty🥳
Happy with the hotel and the staff. Got little problem but they accommodate with the new room as a solution!
"strategic location (near Kuta, not too far to Seminyak and quite close to the airport), very friendly staff, near souvenir shop (next to Krisna), good breakfast (especially Asian food)"
"Very satisfied with our stay. Rooftop swimming pool was amazing, bed was comfy and room was clean. Staffs were very friendly, they helped us to rent bike and package to travel Nusa Lambongan. Buffet breakfast was good too with plenty of items. Location was close to airport.
The only problem that we faced was traffic sound, as this hotel is situated by a busy road  cars sound may bother you, usually cars do not honk horns in Bali, sometime there was some bike with big sounds was speeding on the road, which was little disturbing, otherwise everything was perfect."
"Perfect for staying.
Their located beside Krisna Tempat Oleh oleh.
At located beside the main Road sunset Road.
You can across the street and meet minimart over there"
"We are happy with the location and an excellent service at the Atanaya hotel Bali.
The hotel is well located around shopping centres and restaurants.
The staffs are very helpful and making sure we're staying comfortably."
"located in the center of kuta, easy access to anywere to southern Bali"
Good for tourist
"Great hotel & very friendly staff, the room is vey clean & reasonable price!"
"My 3rd time stay at this hotel, great location! They upgrade my room without charge me more.
Super friendly staff!"
"Good location, near to food and shopping"
"I got cheap peice while stay here. Room is unexpected, very good. Clean, cozy, has a view. This hotel is very recommended to next stay"
"Actually this hotel is in a great location, and value for money.
Just a bit annoyed with aggressive marketing for buying their food restaurant, even call to the room and spamming into personal whatsapp"
"awesome, friendly staff"
"The hotel is okay for a short stay, I'm staying for 2 days but the experienced I had is just plain. The food, the room, the facilities, the parking lot (they parked the cars outside without roof)."
Budget hotel with great location and Cold Aircond. Rooms wise poor exhaust condition.  Kitchen smells very strong inside the room. Many baby cockroaches also.
Cleanliness and equipment in the room and toilet to be considered again.

"This hotel used to be a worth the price, but now not so anymore, thus the 4 stars."
"A hotel with strategic location, in the center of Kuta Bali. It is next to the famous Krisna Souvenir Center, so you can easily shop there. The condition of the hotel was poorly maintained, perhaps also due to the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic which has affected tourism in Bali. This hotel is quite old, so there are some parts of the room that are peeling off and need repair. The room was quite comfortable, although in some parts it looks old and worn. TV, freezer, wardrobe and bathroom amenities were also available. Wifi in the room was smooth.
There were only 2 breakfast choices, and there were not many menu choices due to pandemic conditions. The swimming pool is on the top floor. Based on our valuation during the stay, Atanaya Hotel is more precisely categorized as a 3 - 3.5 star hotel rather than a 4 star hotel, considering the current condition of the hotel. If you want to travel in the Sunset Road area, Atanaya Hotel can be one of your choices.
Let's visit Bali again, and support tourism in Bali."
considering the price with the strategic location and pool is great
Only stayed 1 night. Not great value for money. A bit expensive compared to other places in Bali. Decent location but right on a busy road. Could hear motorbikes throughout the night. Breakfast was good though.
"곰퐝위뉌쉣 조와하쉬묜 예야악 하쉐여엇

It is a cheap accommodation with friendly staff and a good location. The swimming pool on the roof will enrich our vacation. Thank you for the staff's smile."
"I stayed for 1 nite before flying back to my home town. The TV channel didn’t work and the noise from traffic outside hotel is so loud due to poor sound proof system. To make it even worse, the street outside is used for illegal motor racing at 2-3.30am."
"Family 3br doesnt have window on 2 bedroom..they dont mention it on description..it feels like a trap for claustaphobic like me…
Food smell on 2nd room, and they just give refresner on room, which is still smells like kitchen..their kitchen is really under our room..
Really not recommended 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
"As per apps the hotel property claimed they are 4 star but actually they are not. Even though I hardly can accept the hotel as 2 star. There is no review after 2019. The apps showing pictures have taken technically so they look alike 4 star which are not correct though. The bathroom is narrow and not clean, it wasn’t including all bathroom kits even. They aren't provide any mineral waters. All furnitures are dull and not clean. Breakfast also is not up to standard and tasty...."
"Water is salty ( air licin )
Corridor is very noisy with some kind of unknown music ( koridor berisik , speaker depan kamar disetel kencang volumenya )
Waitress is not polite and hurry ( pelayan resto terkesan terburu buru )
Standard and borring food ( makanan dan menunya hampir tidak berganti setiap hari )
Saya menginap 5 hari"
"The room greeted us with a waft of a moldy, closed room in the tropics.  That smell never left in the 24 hrs we were there.  It was disgusting."
"Thanks AGODA, Thanks ATANAYA GREAT HOTEL FOR BUSINESS TRAVELLER
Bali is one of the place that I should go often for my business trip, and recently I tried to book Atanaya through Agoda. The morning I arrived in the hotel, check in and rushed to have a meeting with my client as they stayed in that hotel. I was recomended by them actually to stay in Atanaya as they are several times stay in this hotel. We had a meeting in their coffee corner , it was a nice Caramel Machiato I took to accompany me during the meeting. Excellent,,,,,,, I like it very much.  
Room was beautiful, with Kebaya decoration , clean with desk and chair , to make me easy to work especially the Wifi connection which I consider best. This hotel is located in Sunset road, Kuta area, near to Seminyak and is very accessable to some areas which is very important for the three of us who stay there. I finish my work late evening and still had the chance to go shopping in Krisna, as this shop is the neighbour of this hotel, so I did not need to spent for taxi.
I highly recommend to stay in this hotel especially for for business traveler like me who do not have much time. The next morning , when I checked out, staff was helping me a lot, quick respons which I need. Excellent!!!!!!
Thanks Atanaya, great hotel!!!!!"
"In my busiest days running my Wedding Organizer in Bali, I stayed at Atanaya Hotel.
I got good room rate via Agoda's booking.
I knew this hotel just recently opened, surprisingly the service was excellent..! Indeed I have to say BRAVO to this hotel. Keep your excellent service, Atanaya ;)
Your 5th floor pool is the best.. it relaxed me so much after full day meeting.
Your location which reachable from Kuta and Seminyak helped me a lot. As I didn't have much time, shopping in Krisna just a neighbour walk-was great, I did it after my caramel machiato in your Brewu Coffee Corner. Lovely Brewu..
Again, BRAVO for Atanaya's Team..!! see you in my next project in Bali..!!"
"My daughter & I had a great time staying at Atanaya. Clean, great bed, friendly & helpful staff, delicious menu & fast wifi. The rooftop  swimming pool is just great!  The fact that shopping bazaar - Krishna, just next door make it easier for us to do some shopping :)  Just couple of minutes walk to convenient stores & minutes walk to many spa's & eating places nearby the hotel. Carrefour just about 10mins walk. Its only take about 10mins taxi ride to Kuta/Legian (beach) & plenty of taxi passing by the Sunset Rd outside the hotel. All in all we recommend this hotel to tourist who like to stay away from hustling & bustling of Kuta."
"We had a great time in Atanaya Hotel, stayed for 3 days 2 nights and the room was beyond our expectation due to the affordable price. Requested for a quiet room as i am currently pregnant (cant really sleep), they gave us a room at level 1 and away from others so its great! Havent got a chance to try their breakfast but nice to know its a halal buffet!
Overall, we are satisfied with our stay and will definitely return if we come back to Bali. Value for money and a great location!! Thanks atanaya!"
"When i arrived in Atanaya, the staff was friendly. The room is very good, clean and very comfy. There is refrigirator in the room which is usually not available in other hotel with same price. 
The pool at rooftop is one of the best. Breakfast is good, there're many kind of food. Overall its really more than i expected, because the price is cheap but everything in this hotel was really good. I wanna stay here again if i go to Bali next time. 😁"
"I stayed with my family for two nights. This hotel is very good, not only the building with its unique interior, but also the kindness of the people who provide the good services to guests.
the rooms are great and the foods are great with reasonable price. We have a group dinner with 8 people at the restaurant, all are satisfied with the food.
I booked this hotel thru agoda, previous night we stayed at another hotel, paid more but disappointed. Fortunately we move to Atanaya, we are very happy to stay at Atanaya.
 
Stayed February 2013, traveled with family"
"I stayed in 4 hotels in Bali during my vacation there but I can say that The Atanaya Hotel is the best hotel that I have stayed in Bali. Upon arrival at the hotel, they served the welcome drinks and welcome me with their warm smile. The hotel is new and has modern design,the room is clean and has comfortable bed, the swimming pool has a stunning view of sunset road, they have wide variety of buffet breakfast, location wise it's very close to krishna where i bought some Bali souvenirs and i think the most important thing in this hotel are their staffs, they were very helpful and accommodating and always there to attend to my needs, they were very friendly and always have a warm smile on their face."
"Excellent is how I would describe the Atanaya hotel, i stay here all the time and will always stay here when i come to bali. After staying 100's of hotels before this one i call this fine establishment my home away from home"
"I love my stay at Atanaya, I booked for 3 night with groups of my friend. The location is next to Krisna one of the biggest shopping store in Bali. The breakfast provided is also good with different menu each day, I also tested the Oxtail Soup is very nice to have the soup I love it also served in a very good price.
The roof top swimming pool is made with edgeless so you can swim while watching the city. I bring my daughter there, and ton the last day she got sick. Everything I needed from the hotels is provided very quick. thanks for staff that have helps me alot during my stay"
"Atanaya is such a steal for those who wants to stay in Bali while not killing their wallet. It's a very clean hotel with good services and it's affordable.
The only drawback that i had was only the wifi as it was really slow and i really need the wifi as i had to work and i really needed the internet so badly. But overall it was a pleasant experience staying in Atanaya."
"I spend two night at Atanaya Hotel with my familly, I was suprise that the staff was very warm and frindly, my little son and me was enjoy swimming alot since the swimming pool located in the roof top with great view, it take only 10 minute to the beach and very close to the Krisna (Merchandise Retail),I highly recommend this hotel for Business or Leisure"
"Hotel with great location, cool rooftop pool,and the most thing i liked there is the pillow and bed... its so comfortable,comparing to the other hotel with same price range..
Good job atanaya"
"I don't like Bali too much but this hotel was really great, if I will go to Kuta again I will definitely book it.. Also if you work online and need fast connection, literally in front of hotel is Lineuphub - co working centre where you can meet more online entrepreneurs ( thats basically why I pick it). 
Its little bit more far to beach by walk (15 minutes), but with bike its super easy to get there."
"Came to this hotel for a short stay before heading back home. Was expecting a simple room and a simple hotel but we were wowed by the service and quality of room provided. 
The reception offered to bring our luggage to our room, which were not offered frequently in Bali. We were pleasantly surprised by that. They also lent us adapters as our chargers used 3 pin plugs. 
The room was comfy and clean, I could just roll on the carpet on the floor. It was also so spacious and cozy. However the toilet is a little small . 
Loved it here, will probably stay here again the next time ."
"The staff friendly and helpful. Inet connection super fast. Bfast awesome. Pool was great.. Second time in here. First, 8 month ago only one night. Second, we stay  4nights. Good location also. We love u atanaya ❤️"
"It was our first visit to Bali and, staying only 3 days and 4 nights, the location of the hotel in none of the so called touristy areas was not an issue as we had hired a car and planned to be driving all over the island. It was really relaxing coming back to the hotel with its friendly staff after battling the Bali traffic all day. Equally the lovely buffet breakfast  served in the cross ventilated dining area, soothing music and again the lovely service made for the best starts of the day."
"The Atanaya hotel is very strategicly located in central of city, and i really enjoy the spacious and clean room. The rooftop pool is also very nice, and the food is also good for the price of the hotel
major backdown is the slow and dropping internet connection, other than that everything is fine"
"It could be considered a pleasant stay in this hotel as the staffs are attentive, friendly and helpful. They would help us to book the tour even though it seem to be so last minutes and it was late night. The room is clean, nice and comfortable. All the facilities are accessible. However, for those who like to be near the Kuta Beach and Jalan Legian, it is quite a distance away. At first, according to the map, I thought it was just few streets away, but when I reached there, I just realised, it might not be that convenient to walk there. Moreover, for those who like night life and activities, this would seem to be an unsuitable place and it is quite hard to get our meals. The choices of restaurants around the hotel are limited. 
However, the staffs' services and attitudes are really great. Thanks for all the helps throughout my stay. :)"
"Great, nice n helpful staff, the hotel is near kuta n legian region (by bike, motorcyle).
Next to a famous souvenir shop named Krisna, the hotel is located on main street so its easy if you use a car."
"Such a lovely hotel. The pleasant and polite staff made me feel very welcome from the moment I arrived with a delicious welcome drink. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, breakfast was delicious and the rooftop swimming pool was a spectacular way to start each day. The location was great too; not too far from Kuta beach with lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Overall, I can't really fault my stay at all."
"I really did enjoy my stays at atanaya until the second day I found out that the housekeeping staff who cleaned my room put the dirty unchanged floor mat on the pile of clean towels in my bathroom. I called the staffs and complained about it and they politely apologized and changed all of the towels which is good. The bathroom ventilation is quite poor. I dont think the exhaust fan is working well. It was so hot in the bathroom. Other than the those, I think Atanaya hotel is a good place to stay, it's recommended. Hope that they're inproving what needs to be improved. Thank you, Atanaya :-)"
"Good service, the room is clean, breakfast was delicious"
"Pool nya Atanaya the best🤩
Thanks Agoda"
"Just beside of Krisna, surround got so many restaurants too..."
"was a nice stay, close to good restaurants and a mall is next door."
lumayan lah
Very recommended
"Love where this hotel located…Near from everything…Happy with the room, the bed is comfortable…The only downfall is the bathroom is so tiny…Overall, we love the hotel and will definitely be staying there again…."
"The room smell like it never get any sun. There’s mold on the wall. I checked in at 6 pm, there’s no towel inside. But the staff are friendly."
It's a very nice place to stay. Accessible to all places
Best in price
"A good place if you need a peace of mind, really sweet and helpful staff."
It’s average hotel
"wonderful breakfast, nice hotel, right in the center of Kuta. sure shot recommended."
But location far from the beach
Best price
"This place is okay to stay. The room is nice. The bathroom is old tho. But if just need a comfortable place to stay while traveling in Bali , i will recommend this place ."
Room was not sound  proof....our room.was facing road n was very noisy and also next room people  talking  also can be heard...cant sleep for.the whole night...n breakfast was very little  choice n not so clean cafe area
"Nyaman, bersih dan recomended
Thank you"
"We stay for 2 nights, room is spacious, but need to improve the cleanliness. We ask for make up room but they don’t even change our bath mat either the bath mat is wet. 
But think of the price, we couldn’t comment any"
"Place is nice and with easy access ti every area, pool on the rooftop really nice. I was missing food for the breakfast (limited amout for person)"
Best hotel in sunset road
"Kamar agak kecil, pool not bad, lokasi oke cuma untuk ke pantai agak jauh krn hrs menggunakan kendaraan. Overall sih oke lah dgn harganya."
"Overall, the hotel was pretty good in facilities. It was quite clean, and the location was great, but the breakfast should be better, especially for elders."
Near with everything and easy going
"Best location
Nice pool
Breakfast so so, need to learn more on how to make nasi goreng.
We stay for 2 night, and have several big group booking coincide with us, and we could hear them"
Great place for a short stay. Clean and nice rooms
We arrived quite late into Bali and needed a place to stay for the 3 of us before heading to North Bali the next day. We reserved the connecting rooms with 1 king and 2 single beds. It was clean and comfortable for the price and the staff were kind and helped us with whatever we needed
"the location is strategic, the rooms are comfortable and clean, the minus is the hexosfan doesn't turn on.  overall a good hotel with friendly price"
I surely suggest you to try the pool on the rooftop
Highly recommend!
Ok
Awesome
"House keeping was excellent and their response to any of our request like an iron box, extra towel etc was immediate."
Recommended
"The room is quite small and need some upgrade.
The staff was very polite and helpfull.
Breakfast was standard and good enough.
It is located beside the Krisna Souvenir Store.
There is no fitness centre."
"Great location, clean tidy interconnecting rooms,  staff were lovely, would stay here again, great value for money and awesome breakfast buffet."
"Good staff, best location if you don't like crowded place, near all yummy pork food, beside Krisna.  Cons only their water is smelly."
"LOCATION IS OK, ROOM IS NOT CLEAN, GOT SMELL."
"A great value for $37/night from Agoda website, the men at reception 1am when I was late check in , very friendly and amazing hospitality.  One night only ( transit) ."
there were small cockroaches in the bathroom..
"Atanaya is a great hotel overall. 
We stayed in the family suite which had 2 bedrooms and a lounge room. The kids bedroom didn’t have a window which was great for putting the kids down for a nap. The breakfasts were more Asian style with limited western options. The rooftop pool was pretty awesome and empty most of the time. There was a bit of traffic noise from time to time but not anything to complain about.  Staff were always polite and helpful."
Perfect and perfect
"Everything is always great, Breakfast blewn us away, pool always perfect 💖😊"
Very good
"Wow...
Really enjoy my stay there, Everything just perfect. The pool is nice with great view, the room is cozy, Breakfast is amazing..
Love this place so much, definitely will go back there with the whole family :-)"
"Stayed here for 1 night in a smoking room, the air conditioning was cold despite the room being smoking room. The pool was closed for renovation so couldn't comment on that, the location is just beside Krisna souvenir store, and about 25-30 minutes to the airport. It's definitely worth the money paid, will definitely return when in Bali."
"location is terrible 
hotel is dirty 
not worth the price"
Booked king bed but provided double bed only and asking for more money to get big bed. Overall was good.
Will be back
The parking place availability is terrible. I am difficult to park my car there.
All the facilities were so bad n standart.  The room n the toilet were so small. Towel dirty. Breakfast very standart.  Didn't worth with the money we spend it  to pay. We will never back to this hotel again.
