Nice & clean room.. Good Bathroom with toiletress.. Valuable Facility about restaurant & swimming pool.. Excellent breakfast.. And very warmly staff.. Definitely I will comeback on the next holiday in Bali...
"Hotel near to everywhere, the room is clean, recommend for budget hotel. Need improve for breakfast taste."
"Affordable, clean, and really great location in the heart of Kuta. Not much spend on the hotel facility. But this is very good value"
"Everything about this hotel is awesome. The breakfast is buffet, which all you can eat. The room is super bright and nice with a full body mirror. The shower size is good and it’s using a mirror door. The staffs are perfectly polite and kind."
Ini hotel trakhir my last day holiday.. walau cmn 1 hari br sadar deket bgt ke mcdy n xbucks my fav place n oleh2 depannya jg byk ada bakso afung jg stategis bgt next kisini lg .. bgs bersih ramah  good job
"The room is nice and clean, affordable price, good air conditioner, friendly staff, perfect location at downtown. Surely I'll be back!"
"I booked a twin standard room with balcony for 2 nights and it was absolutely wonderful. The price is unbeatable for the strategic location. Starbucks, McDonald's and a diner are just 2-min walk. Pro tip: if you're coming from Seminyak area, pick the drop off point at McDonald's/ Starbucks instead. Just a short walk and you can save around Rp15K.
The hotel is very well maintained, clean and cozy bedroom. Spotless bathroom with a nice shower. Upon entering my room, the housekeeping might've sprayed some room freshener. It was a nice little touch. 
The pool is great. It's very clean and quite big for a 3-star hotel.
Breakfast was not as great, but it has some options both international and local dishes. Eggs can be ordered separately, but my scrambled eggs tasted horrible. Coffee wasn't that good either, but you can also get one from next door. Apart from that, everything was alright.
Would very much love to stay there again. Thank you!"
Lokasi deket kemana2.. AC dingiinn.. nyaman bangets
"With only 150 thousand rupiah you will get a buffet breakfast with a wonderful staffs.  As well as a cozy room with 60an tv channels. I said yes to be back here if I visit Bali, next time👍🏻"
"Aircon works well
Bathroom has hot water"
"This hotel has perfect location in the main road of sunset road and surounded by good restaurant like ""Laota"". The interior design of the hotel also good."
Have balcony and swimming pool. All clean. Comfortable for remote working.

Everything is great. No complain for anything's at all
"great, best location near to sate babi, near to shops etc amazing see u"
"Fame located at Sunset Road, you can reach mcd, krishna or apotik just few minutes walking. Too bad there are no varieties in breakfast menu."
"Strategic location, fast internet. Food are a bit bland."
"Nice.
Things to be improved are the restaurants, public facilities, and pools to be more cleanly presented."
"Friendly staff.
Nice hotel. 
Great place. but my room is small."
"Good hotel, good location, value price"
"Clean room, however a bit smelly. Lots of food surronding"
If not for the one cockroach in my room my stay this time was worth the money even though a bit disappointed with the breakfast becuase you news to pay if you want some eggs for breakfast. I thought my 4 nights stay was worth it becuase the rate is a bit cheaper this time.
Top markotop
Nice place
The room is a bit small but it's ok for staying comparable with the price and... It is in the main road beside Mall Galeria Bali and many stores along the way.
"This hotel is very good location. Near to beach and the city. You got everything around the hotel. 
Nice price and nice staff."
"We paid $24including buffet breakfast which was top notch with huge variety,  fresh fruit and pancakes a true hit.
Room is devine and the tea/coffee is great. 
An excellent hotel and only regret is that I did not book many more nights there.

Affordable hotel for leasure. The breakfast are so so. but room and overall service are okay
Good value for money & location if you drive motorbike / scooter.
"Murah, bagus, bersih"
Overall is good
"Everything is good, the only minus point is no toiletries."
Will surely come back here.
"Recomended for any purposes, nice room nice place"
"Service ok, breakfast worth it, room not bad but many small cockroaches. You need to worry about car parking every time you return to the hotel because the space is very limited and none of the staff in charge of helping, this makes me think twice to be coming back again."
"Great, would like to stay here again!"
Clean hotel nearby road its noisy bcoz  can hear car/bike way until late.. need more light in lobby and restaurant...swimming pool look need maintance. food at restaurant is taste ok & service  staff at restaurant is helpul to concern abt my orders food.

Great design of rooms and hotel
No comment
"We stayed in Fame Hotel for 1 night only, but we're super satisfied with the stay. Check-in was quick with a welcome drink. The room was clean and the swimming pool looked nice however we didn't get to swim because we didn't have the time. The breakfast was very poor, but it's possible to find something for yourself to get you going. Overall would super recommend it. The idea for the ""fame"" hotel is super unique and with a little bit more budget from the owner it has potential to be absolutely memorable and amazing."
Worthy weekend
"220K for a double bed room, room is rather small ,  hair dryer upon request in reception . Breakfast was nothing special , limited choice . The good things from this hotel is strategic location, near to McDonald’s , Starbucks within walking distance ."
Good value for money. Wish they would provide a list of available TV channels to prevent endless channel changing to find the ones you need
"Recommended for work from hotel because of hi-speed wifi..
warm and friendly staff..
location so strategic, in the middle of city.."
Good place to stay
Will be back
Its decent
"Nice room, good location next to restaurans."
Everage good
Good value and near many eating places
Not too fancy. Clean and ac works
"Spend for 2 night during silent day was great, no to much can do in this hotel coz pool was closed during the day but overall the room was clean, am staying for 2 person only get amenities for one (1 Slipper, 1 tooth brush), the housekeeping open my room without excuse!"
Bright and clean rooms with Hollywierd themes. Great place for creative (i.e. digital nomad)  to get ideas from. The bright interior and design of rooms allows for a higher frequency of thought to occur especially if you need imagination.
"Hotel maintenance minor, entrance room door difficult to open, towel it's time to replace.
Schedule clean the room not available unless request at front office.....to bad."
"Well, for the breakfast there's nothing much to eat nor drink. The aircon was broken and I fell hard because of the aircon water on the floor. Not worth the price."
"We arrived late at 11 pm, it was Dec 29, so the hotel's parking lot was full, but no staff or security help us with our car, the receptionist was busy at the front desk, we have to wait for about 20minutes to get to park our car (with another car experienced the same thing like us -waiting with no parking lot and no one help). After we parked our car, no staff helped us with our luggage, we had to drag the baggage ourself, which is fine except we traveled with the elderly so we did really need help. At least after checked in we expected a good night sleep but no... the air con was leaking.. and the water wet the floor, we called the engineering twice until someone came and fixed the aircon, but after 10 minutes the aircon was leaking again, we called again, the staff came and fixed it again untill it stopped leaking. The sink at the toilet was also leaky. Overall the hotel was old, it needed to be renovated and refresh."
Hotel very dirty there are a lot of cockroach on my room and my mother room. Hotel is really not recommended for stay.
"Got very old broken pillow cases & towels. Breakfast were bad, I think they put 1 kilogram of salt for every food. My family couldn't eat. I was not allowed borrow dining table for dinner except bought something. Who want buy food with 1kg of salt?? Restaurant with many cats around and stink."
"First about slippery.
I call FO to ask about that and they said have but need buy that 10k.  So I said okey bring me now. For me is not about money, but is suppose facility from hotel. And is not only that, shower cap"
"The room was infested with smal roaches. Minutes into my stay in the room, i already killed 5 cockroaches in the desk. More roaches appeared in the shower drain the following day. The bed sheet has an oil stain. No in-room fridge, no coffee, tea and sugar provided. But the hotel is in good location though. Good for over night stay and not recommended for long stay."
"Hotel allowed me to had earlier check in at12PM. But when I got my room, that was really dirty. Space was so small with twin bed. Far enough from the beaches. Less then my expectation because the price was more expensive than another hotel. And I left the hotel at 8pm to another hotel."
"Old hotel with old broken pillow case & towels.  I got dirty bed sheet. No fridge. A/C very noisy. The only positive point is helpfull staff, except silly security. When I was parking the car he didnt give information, after I left the car he wanted me to move the car."
"Staff friendly and helpfull..
Budget hotel with very good ambience..
AC very good..
Every day cleaning by CS..
Wake up call without request between 8 am and 9 am to remind breakfast closed at 10 am.. 
For some people maybe disturbing  but for us.is very good thing..
Request honeymoon package for us and for my friends with IDR 150.000 (bed flower, duck towel set up, roses bucket, greetings from hotel and cake with nice taste and looking..
6 days at fame hotel sunset road is high expectation..
Keep up for the good work.."
"Value for money, clean and nice hotel. Friendly staff. The security guard was very helpful. He cautioned us to be careful while walking around late night. He always helped us crossing the busy road in front of the hotel. Overall, extremely satisfied. Will highly recommend it. Fame Hotel - keep up the great work and keep up the competitive price. Really worth it."
"The theme of the hotel is famous people and glam, and we can see it everywhere we look. Every room has a different painting of a famous person. The room's clean and smells fresh, thanks to the very good air circulation. We had a room at the corner, facing the swimming pool, which looks like a giant aquarium. There are a lot of areas of interest and restaurants within walking distance, including McDonald's and Burger King.
Breakfast was just ok, local cuisine, chicken porridge and some choices of bread for those who prefer it. Their bihun goreng is nice, especially with the belachan chilli. 
The staffs are friendly young people, they look like high school graduates, so some more hospitality training and experience will be helpful.
We trully enjoyed our stay at Fame and will stay there again in the future."
"It's a smart choice hotel in Bali, very clean,nice staff,comfort room and good breakfast also strategic location.  Very recomamded hotel. We will back to Fame hotel soon...."
"Value for money , right in the central of sunset road , 
Room was great , bed is Oke , shower pressure was nice , all you need is there 
Never had chance to try the breakfast but I believe is nice 
Staff super friendly and helpful 
Hair dryer is on request for your information 
Overall so happy with this hotel and definitely come back 
Thank you :)"
"I'm stay on 25 - 27 for wedding. During stay at the hotel. Everything was amazing. The design, the staff is super friendly (especially for FO, who taking care my dress and flower buket wedding). I'm so very very. And can't wait to looking forward to came back here. Thank You Fame Hotel 🙏🏻🙏🏻"
"This hotel is very nice, well designed and has unique concept in every side of this hotel. It is like a movie maker studio for me. The room is very comfy and clean, but may be a little bit small space for me. For the breakfast is okay, but need to improve. Easy access because this hotel is located in front of main road, some fastfoods and minimarkets nearby hotel. The hotel staff also very nice and helpful, especially for Mr. Leskan (if I didn't forget for the name:D) is very friendly for me. The point that need to improve of this hotel is in every room has to be provided hair dryer and in the room may be a little bit noisy if there are people walk in front of room. Overall, I very enjoyed my 4 nights stay at this hotel, recommended hotel !!!"
"No complaint!
Everything is great, very comfy bed, blocked out curtain perfectly, clean & brand new hotel.
I love it, it's very quirky hotel with showbiz fame themes.
I wanted stay longer and re book but it's always fully booked.
This is one of my favorite hotels in Bali.
Above expectation 3* hotel."
"This is my second time  stay in Fame Hotel. 
And always ""Amazing Place"" . Can't wait for come back.
Thank You Fame Hotel"
Very clean room. Easy access. Walking distance to Mc D.  Besides the main road. Give us free breakfast even though it is not included in the booking. Overall it is a very nice stay for our short vacation in Bali..
Cute little hotel on the busy Sunset Road.  The only negative is that the door/walls are very thin so it was quite noisy.
"It is a new hotel, everything clean and new. The celebrity theme is interesting. We enjoyed the breakfast, the asian touch of the place. There are a few restaurante at walking distante and it is just next to Bali Brasco. Value for money.  Rooms are small and not very sound proof. I would return."
Experience stay here only for one night with my husband. The bed is comfortable and room is very clean. The staff is friendly. Surely will back to Fame for next stay.
"The location at Sunset road,  not the hectic/noisy area,  so you can sleep well. Room was basic but ok. Please keep the cleanliness up,  especially at the toilet."
"Service at receptionist is nice, and friendly. They always smile especially the lady very helpful,she help us call taxi to airport, and provide number for us to rent a motorbike. The hotel is clean, modern, and near to market agung. the buffer breakfast is nice.. Overall is 10/10. Recomend to stay in bali with budget.."
"The biggest plus pt is the location, it's along a prominent road Jln Sunset, & next to Starbucks, Mcdonald's, Hokben(Japanese fast food) & walking distance to many other F & Bs; there's Diva Karaoke(Gd family karaoke w plenty of English songs), convenience stores, ATMs, etc. Go for it!!"
"our location around +/- 2 km from very famous places in Kuta, Seminyak area. 
So many Places that we can reaches sorrounding area hotel. Enjoy the location and the staff are very help full."
"New Building with the Era's theme for Each floor , Clean and Location was Excelent near Kuta and other fav destination in Denpasar , Very recomended hotel"
"Very Good hotel, new property, in kuta area, easy to find foods..was great to stay here..Good breakfast,"
"Literally value for money.
A clean and well-designed hotel with super cheap price..
Overall I enjoyed my stay, the only thing needs improvement is the breakfast quality, but still acceptable.
And during check in, request for a room that is not facing the main road, very noisy at night..not a problem for a deep sleeper maybe, but can be quite a turn off for others. 
Fastfoods, minimarkets, souvenir shops nearby 👍🏻"
"Value for money, nice area, bug bed,good breakfast"

"nice hotel with friendly staff, price are reasonable as well"
"Good place, near airport, Mall, culinary, centre area. Friendly staff, room clean. For breakfast only standar but ok.  Over all i like stay here."

"Group traveler with my worker, booked total 16rooms. All are ok with no complaints, rooms pretty clean, spacious, and the location is great nearby dewi sri st where alots of restaurant, cafe and angkringan"
"Booked total 16 rooms, all are ok no complaints, the room is clean and quite spacious for 2person, bathroom is clean hot water for shower is great, AC was cold but no fridge and wardrobe inside the room  just standard. The pool is not to big and next to the resto, serving buffet breakfast but not alot of choices and the taste is just average... the great thing about this hotel is the room is quite comfortable for resting at night & not noisy from surrounding area. And very near Krisna oleh2 and dewi sri st where plenty of restaurant, cafe or event angkringan and some are available 24H"
"The AC in my room is leaking, and there is cockroach"
i love the room but unfortunately the ac was leaked and make my clothes wet but the hotel staff help us to solve the problem by giving free laundry
really nice. but woke up in the middle of the morning and I felt like I was suffocating due to a certain smell. decided to open the door of my balcony and felt comfortable already with the ventilation/exhaust
"A lot of fast food around hotel, easy to find food."
"It's not really cheap, but it's okay price for the provided facilities. I chose this place because I just need a place to shower and sleep without the need for thick walls for very comfortable sleep."
I like it here. Middle of everything. Restaurants are just around the corner also malls. Buffet foods are new everyday
Nice place
good
