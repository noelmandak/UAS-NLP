"Booked two rooms, stayed 4N. Buffet breakfast could be improved by having more varities and live cooking station. Particularly want to commend Security personnel Fino who went all the way out to fetch my mom so Siloam hospital at 4am as we couldn't find any taxi at this hour during emergency. Fino even stayed with us during the time we were at hospital assisting on registration procedures etc. TS Suites Managemenet/ Director- Fino is definitely a keeper!!  He has worked with the hotel for more than 10yrs and should have had receive some recognition I hope!"
"this is my second time staying in this hotel, and this hotel's quality is not changing. I am a happy customer! starting from the top quality service, the staffs were very helpful, accomodating and friendly. not to mention the cleanliness, spacious room, large bed and large sofa, very comfy. the room, the parking area, the lobby, and all were very convenient. cannot say enough good qualities about this hotel. 
maybe some things that need to be improved is the breakfast variation and bathroom door need some refinement."
"TS Suites service was the best and top notch. The room is quite huge for 2 with a huge bathroom. Theres a few mart infront of the hotel and 5 mins away via gojek to Bintang Supermarket. If you are lazy to go to La Favela or any clubs at Seminyak, TS Suites has their own club called Jenja and it was the best club ever as it wasnt crowded at all. Mr Mack gave the best service and let us feel welcome. We didnt get to try their breakfast but next time as we will coming back to this hotel again."
"1. Breakfast was excellent. And the all day breakfast option was highly appreciated. 
2. Mini bar (bottled water and soda) was refilled everyday
3. Shuttle bus to the beach waa convenient
4. Staff were attentive and courteous
5. Stay here if you want a relaxing and peaceful hotel"
"i stayed in few hotels in Bali and TS was by far the cleanest hotel in seminyak and sunar (of course, some other hotels in nusa dua is another story). location is also good for some quick souvenier shopping. staff are friendly and facilities are good."
"It is very nice to have the infinity pool on our first day in Bali;
Breakfast is also nice, tho there might be too mamy people so we needed to wait for a while to get the glasses to drink"
"There is nothing to complain. Everything is good about this hotel. My children and i enjoyed everything here. First hotel that give you option to have your breakfast served in your room( all day long) even though it is not that tasty😂
And also first hotel that open its pool until 1 am... lovely!!!"
The room was really clean and they follow the health protocols well. And they clean the rolm everyday. They response to my request very quickly and even easier as they dont mind to inform us in any service we requested by whatsapp for the details.
Staffs are friendly. Room was big and clean. Price is considered very cheap if I compare with the quality of the hotel. Everything was perfect
"This is my second stay in TS Suites, the last time was in 2018, and 4 years later, the hotel is still very well maintained. The hotel facilities, amenities, breakfast, room are perfect. They even have daily events for the hotel guests! I joined the Yoga class and it's super refreshing. Def will come back to stay here."
"Ts suites has got to be the place i’ve stayed in bali.  
Great location, very convenient. Hotel staff were great!"
"Good room, good staff, all day breakfast even you miss 7-11am breakfast time. They give u free soda at room, good pool, lots of entertaiment like night club, kids room, billiards & yoga.
They even contact you personally through WhatsApp to ask how are you doing, and they invited me to pool area to join a small game with FnB voucher as a prize.
Will come back for sure!"
"My 3rd visit here, I like that the rooftop infinity pool is open till 1am! (Most pools close at 8) Breakfast is good, rooms are amazing- large, clean comfy, modern tasteful decor, the free toiletries smell divine! Free minibar- water, cokes, sprites. Short walk to everything. My go to hotel love it!"
"This place is upscale for the price.  Walking distance from the beach.  All modern amenities.  Close to laundry, 7-Eleven, shops, and Potato Head bar."
"Our room was comfortable with lots of space, very clean. Complimentary Covid packs were fantastic. The facilities were superb. The swimming was absolutely gorgeous. Enjoyed every moment. Cannot fault the staff, they were fantastic. The only thing I didn't like was the toaster, please change it."
Great hotel. Extra large rooms and the infinity pool is outstanding!
"Lovely. Great room tshell. Staffs are top notch, have plenty of parking. One bad thing is noisy road noise. Request for room not on the road side."
TS Suites is a nice hotel with good location at the heart of Seminyak Bali. Also have spacious room. Absolutely would love to stay here again.
"The room was spacious even for 4 adults, love the free flow minibar, breakfast was nothing special they put very limited food and reload it when its empty (but it takes too long to reload). Overall nice hotel with nice location"
Everything was perfect. Only thing to improve is the iron for clothes which is not provided in the room. Waited long for it to arrive as there was limited unit
Beautiful property in a quiet street but close by to the main legian rd. There are 2 mini marts right opposite the hotel and laundry service too. The roof top pool is amazing…. Great views! The staff are all amazing and very friendly……I would highly recommend this hotel!
Clean room with a nice tub and great pool. Wish the breakfast buffet could be better!
Servis ok banget. Bs wa an ama stafnya. Kamarny oke. Kebersihan kolamnya jg oke bgt wlopn hari2 terakhir pompany ga nyala lg. Jadi ny keruh deh kolamnya. Breakfast just so so
"I think TS suite is the best value for money hotel near seminyak. Big room, clean hotel, nice staff, and they have car to take us to the Seminyak beach for free every 1 hour"
"So happy with this hotel. Peaceful environment, not too much crowd.
We can have our breakfast at anytime.
Very friendly and helpful staff."
"Good place to live, big room"
"Great hotel. Fantastic pool. Very friendly and helpful staff. 
The rooms are spacious and well done. Unique styling and high quality finish.
Avoid booking through Agoda as much better terms with other groups.
A very nice hotel that is obviously managed well and they have fantastic staff. 
Definitely recommend TS Suites.
This was a fast booking after a terrible experience at the dreadful Bali Rich Luxury Villas, which was the opposite of luxury. Mysteriously, Agoda had that as a preferred property. 
TS Suites is a great choice for any visitor to Bali."
Simple n the location is very good..
"good sized room, great buffet breakfast, and good pool/sunlounge area on top"
"Great location!
Big rooms, love the tub, big swimming pool, great breakfast.
The service is also excellent."
"Very spacious room and bathroom, very clean, nice bathtub. Lack of menu and variation for the breakfast but not too bad either. Great rooftop pool especially at night and adequate gym. Very big basement parking. Not a great location, still a distance away from jl Raya Seminyak, better to bring car if u want to stay in this hotel. Good deal for money though"
Its quite legit..the facility's good and the room was homie too..
Cool ac free shuttle close to bintang supermarket
Good place to stay
"That’s just an awesome part about it. Everything else is as good as any other 5-star hotel. 
I love the surrounding small eateries even the martabak and terangbulan street vendor couple steps away from the hotel. 
Downside: not much the hotel can do, but it’s just an ugly street to put a 5-star hotel. It could be a “first impression turn offs”, but once you’re inside the lobby, it delivers."
Breakfast all day!
"Best Service, Clean, and on top of that, the hotel was very generous by giving free re-schedule due to force majuere event happened to our original date of reservations. Definitely coming back and highly recommended!"
"hotel staffs were friendly, professionals and helpfull. totally worth it."
"Obviously for the flexibility, friendly staff and cleanliness"
More varieties of food for breakfast won’t hurt. I had breakfast here for 3 days but sadly all menu are the same each day.
"Best service, spacious room, comfy bed and i love your artistic alley on the way to the rooms 👍👍
Definitely comeback again."
"Flexibility, Cleanliness, friendly staff 
All OK"
"Staff are awesome , helpful and very well mannered.
Did their best during our stay."
My brother and his wife enjoyed their stay in this excellent villa
The staff was very helpful and room was great
Facilities quite old (at the wall corner ) but staff are friendly and supportive
The room was well maintained and clean
"The hotel has a great roof top swimming pool and bar, also has night club at the basement, basically it has all. The location is ok, but if you wanna go to the beach or explore the other pubs you will have to use a car."
"I like this hotel for its location, staff and usually the buffet breakfast, however recently they have cancelled buffet breakfast due to covid-19 and it’s just not as good anymore.
I used to look forward to the mini bar refills in the room, but again, this has been cut back to a few different drinks.
The pool on the rooftop is nice, just a bit too shallow.
The room I stayed in was huge and clean, I really liked the decor and the amenities provided in the room"
"Located in Seminyak area,  this hotel has very helpful and friendly staff! 
Breakfast is just okay, nothing special..
I love their free activities, making hand sanitizer, it was so fun."
Good place
"Spacious room, value for money..."
Overall Perfect
The facilities are modern and new. Staffs are friendly. Food is various.
"Solo traveler, loved my stay. Beautiful property. Great food. Service was professional. I would recommend to anyone."
Very good hotel with very spacious room.
"Nice staff. Breakfast basic.  Food very basic. served uncooked pizza made us sick.
They dont have any View from rooms except facing Noisy street, or to other rooms.
Only may have a view from their private villas.
Room size is pretty good though nd staff is lovely."
"Good location. 
Spacious room, but not sure why they doesnt allow to add extra bed. 
Hotel n room are modernly designed n decorated. However there is a need for maintenance on their vinyl flooring and toilet & shower area. Many stubborn stains on floor and wall so it very unsightly.  
Staff are friendly and approachable especially those at the restaurant.
However the 2 or 3 ladies at reception needed more customer service training. They were rather cold and least approachable."
The room we stayed was so close to the road.  It was very noisy.. can't get a proper sleep due to the noise.. location of this hotel not so convenient .. but hotel staff are very friendly n room is clean ..
Good for leisure trip. Room is too dark for my liking.
Near to seminyak central and kuta. room is big enough and clean.
Great stay at TS Suites Seminyak. Check in process was easy. Room was spacious and very clean.
Check out until 2pm. Hotel was good and clean
"Rooms nice, staff very nice, food not great, service very slow."
I found the room has no light in their ceiling. So in the night its quite difficult to read magazine or workong with laptop
Pictures and reality is same....
"Breakfast menu variant is very minimalist for 5star or even 4star, and the waiters at the restaurant at breakfast are almost all unfriendly, especially to local tourists like me"
"This is a good 4 star hotel but not a 5 star. They should change the rating on this hotel.
Room space is excellent, not a great breakfast for vegan/vegetarion. Amenities are nice for a 4 star hotel."
"I run out of breakfast for 5 days out of 6 at 8am in the morning, I know I was there during peak holiday sessions but they should prepare. The room was dusty due to old carpet in the room. The staff were helpful. Towels and sheets were clean. AC was cold. The street in front of the hotel is a one way, so if you use car - to get back to the hotel you need to do a one round."
"It is a good hotel and enjoy staying, but they could offer basic amenities like razer and hair brush."
"We got the room under the gym, and the sound of people lifting and smashed the things sooo loud to our room. Plus the motorcycle sound soo loud out there. 
If you want a quiet stay, please stay away from this hotel. But if you want to have a huge room, villa kind of stay, this is for you.
And oh, the breakfast is boring"
"Staff is friendly and accommodating.
The rooms are good but amenities are definitely not complete. Had to call housekeeping for many additional things. Also, bedding, pillows etc are worn out."
"I would imagine a 5 star resort would make a room sound proof if on a busy road however no! 24 hours a day is constant traffic noise, we stayed in a jacuzzi suite, large rooms and clean, rooms are dated however well maintained 
Breakfast was also basic to be considered 5 star
I had high expectations, was"
"We rented car on our arrival in Bali Airport and when we reached the hotel area, it's soo confusing that we have to turned around 3 times to finally got in to the hotel and when we asked the valet parking, they mentioned that they do not have the services, so we have to circle once again. 
The Breakfast is so disappointed consider the call their hotel are all Suites. Will never go back again"
"Furniture 20%
Breakfast 20%
Quite 20%
Staff 20%
Location 30%"
"I feel quite satisfied with the choice of TS Suites. I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of September 2014
- The hotel offer one-way pick-up service at the airport, they sent email to me before and arrange car for me
- The design of the hotel is beautiful, it is new hotel and all the equipment are at good conditions.
- I stayed at the TStone Suite with large room, nice view
- All items in the Mini bar is free ( Beer, coke, green tea, kitkat, snacks) so the guests feel very satisfied
- The staffs are very friendly, always smile and are helpful.
- The location is quite good ( get away from the a busy Kuta) but it is not any far, take about 10 minutes to go to Kuta and 30 minutes to Nusa Dua by motorbike
- The service around the hotel are really good with cheap price. You can hire motobike in 5 minutes without any registation or deposit money ( about $5 / day) because there is a motobiker rental shop opposite the hotel. There are also a mini supermarket, some massage service, a sim card store opposite the hotel. You can change money just by walking to the main street of Seminyak in less than 5 minutes ( and the changing money rate is better than any place in Bali I have seen)
- There is a small local market near the hotel ( about 10 minutes walking, right hand side) where they sell local food. I have tried the grilled fish, squids, prawns here, quite fresh and super cheap. I feed happy because I can see the normal Balinese style ( not many tourist here). 
Only one plus point of TS suites is the hotel need to improve the breakfast. Not much variety of foods and the foods are not changed everyday so maybe feel a bit bored at the last day.
Overall I rate TS Suites 9/10, even better than some 5* hotel I have stayed before. Bali is not as beautiful as I expected, however the service here is quite good, including this hotel.
Definitely recommend to my friends and family. TS Suites is a good choice because it is not busy like Kuta and not expensive like Nusa Dua."
"From the moment I stepped into TS Suites, I was very impressed.  The hotel is beautifully designed (both inside and out).  The lobby is impressive and the rooms even more.
My friend and I stayed in a TShell room which was huge.  It also has a sort of open plan bathroom design which seems very trendy right now with hotels. There are panels that you can pull to enclose the bathroom for privacy.  Or you can open it if you fancy watching tv while you're in the tub.
The decor and design of the room is beautiful, modern and bright.  The mini bar which had some snacks, soda and water was free (to our surprise).
The 3rd floor seem to be where all the activities are.  That is where the restaurant is, a gym and an infinity pool that looks out to the city.  There is also a bar at the poolside which makes for a nice afternoon sunning with drinks by the pool.
The hotel also arranges activities for hotel guests.  You in fact get SMS messages from the hotel about activities happening that day like parties at the poolside, crafts etc.
The only thing the hotel could probably improve on is the internet speed.  there is strong wifi signal all over the hotel but even my smartphone couldnt access anything.
Overall however, I am extremely happy with TS suites and i will most likely book the hotel again if I return to the Seminyak area.  The customer focus by the staff is excellent.  There was even someone asking us for feedback while we were hanging out by the pool - anything at all that they can improve. 
I had an excellent experience at TS Suites and highly recommend it."
"TS Suites is our last hotel to spend our night in our recent trip to Bali. Before, we have spent a night in Sofitel, a luxury hotel. However, we concluded that TS Suites is also a top hotel in Bali.
Located in strategic place, TS Suites provide unusual added value service to the guest. It has a free minibar (soft drinks and bars of kit kat) which is refilled every day, an all day breakfast (so you won't have to wake up early just to cash in your breakfast coupon). It has two pool tables in entertainment area as well as library, internet, and children play ground which is free. It also has roof top pool, bar, and gym. and it operates 24 hours. So basically, TS Suites is a hotel which follow your needs, not you who follow their rules.
Room is okay, great design with recent sliding door trends for bathroom. for the size, even the lowest tier, TSand is quite broad and convenient enough for two people.
Bathroom can be improved though. The rain showers system can be improved because when using the hand showers, waters still sometimes drops from above. Housekeeping staff should be more incentive in cleaning the floors and the edges. It is a brand new hotel (which is opened in 2014) so it will still look clean. However, the challenge will be on next years and on. A good hotel should be seen whether the bathroom is clean and rust-free or not."
"Our stay at TS Suites was good. We had stayed in another hotel in Seminyak the week before and while TS Suites has a fairly good location, walking distance to beach, shops and restaurants it was not as good a location as our previous hotel. The room was lovely, very comfortable with a gorgeous bath tub. We had room service and couple of times and this was fairly good. There was a fairly big selection for breakfast but it did not meet the same standards as our other hotel in Seminyak. The staff were also not as friendly or welcoming as we had experienced at other hotels in Bali. The pool was lovely and the free minibar was a great touch! This is a lovely hotel but I would recommend U Paasha more than TS Suites for better service, breakfast, location and a much more chilled out vibe!"
"I am a total TS Suites convert.  I stumbled across it by chance walking to Hammerhead Gym from my already booked accommodation and decided to ""test drive"" it for future reference.  I stayed in the lowest price TSand Room, the mid range TStone Suite and the upper priced TSun Suite on different nights.  All three are excellent.  Obviously you totally get what you pay for with your two bedroom, own pool villa in the sky TSun Villa and I heartily recommend it to those with the cash to spare.  But if your budget is more limited, I can guarantee I was equally happy for different reasons with my night in the ""low end"" TSand room.  And the TStone Suite room was really beautiful for those whose budget is in the mid range. To sit by the amazing fifty metre pool on the third floor, looking out over Seminyak, sipping a cocktail made by the excellent G and his staff at the pool bar, is an exercise in sheer relaxation and indulgence.  I have found my new home in Seminyak for my relaxing Bali getaways."
"Both my girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay here at TS Suites over Christmas. We even tried room service on two occasions, which by our surprise, was the best Nasi Goreng during our stay in Bali! breakfast buffet in the morning was good - we particularly enjoyed their omelette and banana and strawberry pancakes made-to-order by their chef. There was also oriental selection at the breakfast such as congee, which was much needed for my girlfriend who happened to have diarrhea on the last day.
Although customer service was excellent (as with all Balinese people, they are all so friendly!), there was an episode of miscommunication over charges of phone call which I think was due to language barrier. As a tip, always clarify if you are uncertain! 
We also found confidentiality was a problem in foreign countries like Indonesia. On the back of a scrap paper we were given, it was a scanned passport page of a fellow traveller. I was completely furious and took this to counter. They explained these are all scanned data and would delete it after our stay. But how could I verify this?
If the management team can look into this area and improve this, I would then consider returning to TS Suites. Overall it was a pleasant stay, a hotel that is centrally located in Seminyak."
"I could not have been happier staying at TS Suites. First, the staff made such a good impression. Our guest relations officer, Cherry, was warm and friendly, and extremely helpful. Instead of passing us off to a bellman, she personally escorted us to our room and showed us how to use everything in it. Other staff members we passed were also extremely friendly and polite, always smiling and greeting us. We were also checked out by another great guest relations officer, Maria, who was fast and efficient, but also very friendly and coversational.
Second, the room was INCREDIBLE. For the money we paid, it was HUGE. You had more than enough space to do cartwheels around the king-sized bed (although not advised). The style is contemporary and modern with clean lines, which we liked a lot. In the enormous bathroom, the tub was huge and you could part the walls so that you can watch tv while taking a bath. There's also a great rain shower and separate toilet cubicle with a good ventilation fan (thank you!).
Third, the hotel is just a short 10 to 15-minute stroll to Seminyak beach, and only 20 minutes to and from the airport (even with some traffic).
The swimming pool is also an infinity-styled one on the roof with plenty of deck chairs for suntanning. The hotels attached eateries are also excellent and extremely reasonably-priced.
Seriously, I could not rave anymore about this hotel and I look forward to returning there again should I ever travel to Bali in future."
"The hotel is beautiful - very new and modern with lovely rooms, a gorgeous infinity pool with day beds, great restaurants and the staff are incredible. Nothing was too much effort and they all went the extra mile to make us comfortable and looked after. The bathroom is huge, the beds are incredibly comfy and everything is as perfect as you'd expect. My only issue was that although it's well located for shops and restaurants and double 6 beach, it isn't really in Seminyak - more the border of Seminyak and Legian so it's a bit of a walk to Seminyak square. It didnt ruin my stay though! Breakfast amazing, happy hour a brilliant concept please start doing it every day. When we arrived it was mostly couples so quiet and peaceful, more children towards the easter weekend though, so if you don't like sharing the pool with dive bombing kids just tell your trip for term time.
Just a warning for other guests which perhaps the hotel could mention is that there is a scam going on along the road to the beach and around Seminyak where a local will stop you to tell you about Karma hotels in Ulu watu - they will then tell you youve won a prize and you need to come with them to the hotel - this is a setup to get you to sign up for a timeshare. They pick on western couples but if they think you are a backpacker they aren't interested so try that to get rid of them. Nothing to do with TS suites, but perhaps something they should warn people of... 
We couldn't have had a lovelier stay however and would go back in a heartbeat!"
"I recently stayed at the TS Suites Bali and WOW!!!
I would like to especially thank Cindy/Yuda for the beautiful greeting each morning at breakfast and for all the times they went above and beyond to assist our very large family group.
I would like to thank Katrina and our other Guest Service Officers who were always around to sort out taxi's (I have forgotten the name of the beautiful GSO lady with the blue contacts, sorry).
The birthday cakes OMG my Mum and Daughter both LOVED THEM! they had fireworks on them and were absolutely amazing and complimentary, what a treat for a young 60 and 21 year old!
All domestic staff were brilliant and housekeeping superb.
Complimentary Breakfast had an assortment of hot cold, sweet and savoury and something to please EVERYONE in our large booking. It was fresh and simply AMAZING!!!!
A BIG ""thank you"" to management for the free upgrade from TSKY to TSHORE (it was worth waiting till 4pm to check in) and thank goodness as we were able to play cards at the larger table and relax around the pool. You need a fan to blow a breeze in the kitchen which is cheap at $25 AUD from Carrefour if the Kitchen doesn't have any left to borrow.
The rooftop pool and bar are amazing, a bit on the pricey side, but what a view, the hot pool was a hit with the oldies, whilst the younger ones frolicked in the pool and played with the colour changing lights.
So whether you are a couple with or without children, or a large group booking like we were, I highly recommend. We used the Deluxe  room, TStone suite and TShore Villa and NO ONE had any complaints in regards to the rooms. I highly recommend and some of the family are already planning the next holiday here. Only 10/15 minutes from Kuta and 20 minutes from airport.
Thank you again to everyone who helped our Trip to celebrate my Mums 60th and my girls 21st birthdays, it has been a trip of a lifetime! 
PS the nightclub Jenga is $25 AUD to enter and one of the best in Seminyak :)"
"We loved our time at TS Suites. Seminyak was a bit of a culture shock and this hotel's location, right in the middle of a busy main road, wasn't my favourite, however it was convenient for the beach and a lot of the restaurants that Seminyak has to offer. 
The hotel itself was wonderful. We had a suite which was spacious and clean with complimentary mini bar which is amazing. Breakfast was varied and plentiful and if you missed breakfast, you could have a breakfast from the a la carte menu all day. The pool area is also great although as some have said, the constant house music is slightly annoying. We did enjoy a sunrise up there once followed by some sunrise yoga.
The staff are all so lovely and friendly and chatty. Honestly, this was a great hotel. We didn't love Seminyak but TS Suites made it as good an experience as it could have been."
"Being a frequent traveler and stayed in many different hotels and beach resort around the world, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who are visiting Bali. 
We were given a hotel tour before proceeding to our room for check in. The staff are very friendly and informed us about the activities (e.g fashion show, aqua yoga) held at the hotel.
We had free one way transport (from airport to hotel/ hotel to airport), we chose from airport to hotel and the driver asked if we needed to purchase SIM card and drove us to a shop to get it. We were quoted 300k for 6GB 3G, not sure if that's the regular price though. 
The room look exactly like what the pictures shows, it was clean, bright, comfortable and quiet.  Mini bar (beer, soft drinks, chocolates and potato chips) is free and replenished daily.
There is free buggy service to double six beach. Would recommend walking there instead as the traffic is bad especially in the evening and it would take longer if you're taking the buggy. You could do some mini shopping while walking to the beach too.
Love the spread at breakfast buffet and we could even order egg benedict. Definitely a plus point!
Another thing I love about the hotel is the infinity swimming pool at level 3. Pool water is warm during the night and it's open 24hrs.
Definitely staying in this hotel again. Looking forward to my next bali trip with TS Suites. Will stay in the Villa the next trip ;)"
"We stayed in TSand Suite for our first night in Bali and we were already awed by the service and design. When we moved to TSky villa the next day, we were totally in cloud nine! The private pool is very well maintained. The 2 bedrooms are nicely designed with very spacious bathrooms. Each bathroom comes with a large bathtub, rain shower with transparent roof, and wardrobe for hanging clothes. We love to relax at the cosy living room. It was so comfortable to have breakfast in our own villa. The kitchen lighting is rather dim though. It was my hubby's birthday and the hotel crew helped me to surprise him at our villa with a sparkling birthday cake. They sang him a birthday song too! The complimentary 1-hr massage for 2 pax was great too! They have all-day breakfast and default check out at 2pm. The public pool and gym are open 24 hrs. Too bad we didn't have time to explore the toddlers' play corner at TSea Leisure Club. We are totally impressed by how the hotel puts guests' needs/desires first in their service in every way possible! Will definitely revisit TS Suites again next time!"
"This hotel is classy and brand new. We stayed in the suite and the standard room.. Both rooms are amazing, stylish, extremely clean and new. You don't feel like you're in a standard room. 
The service is spectacular as the staff are all thoroughly friendly, knew us by first names and were always willing to have a chat.
The pool is fantastic, with areas for maximal sun and great shade. The pool is surrounded by large sun beds, which makes it comfy and relaxing. 
Food is great, breakfast buffet is good.
The hotel organised my partner proposing to me, they set up the room with rose petals saying 'will you marry me' and made love hearts etc. they were happy to help and celebrated our engagement with a surprise cake left in our room.
We have stayed at many hotels and resorts, and TS suites is easily our number 1 rated accomodation.
We will defiantly only be staying at TS suites every time we come to bali."
"This is our 4th or 5th visit to Bali and we decided to stay in somewhere not too far or too near to Kuta, to enjoy some quite time. I have to say, TS Suites Bali and Villas is more than we expected. The location was a little far from the night life but it is quite convenient since it has convenient stores and supermarket around the corner. The room, fantastic! Nicely renovated, very modern and a good size for 2. I love the open bath concept well of course, you may choose to close the sliding door if you must. Hotel staffs were friendly and great. The breakfast was good and so was the facilities (Pools, billiard, gym and even a library!)."
"I must say its was a pleasure to stay at TS Suites Bali and Villas, because this hotel as a god location, very close to several restaurants, shops, and beach ( must i suggest others with less people), and just 30 minutes from Denpasar airport.
The rooms are enormous, refine taste, and the other facilities reflect the same pattern, like the  public areas, the fitness, the pool in the roof with a beautiful view for sunrise /sunset.
The staff is polite, nice, providing us with the information for visiting Bali.
My family of 4 get the best welcome to Bali, and i recommend this hotel if you want to say in the Seminyak, Legian area"
"While my friends stayed at different hotels, i decided to see myself the TS Suites Bali based on my friend's recommendation. Spent two nights, and i picked the TSSand Suite. It takes a while to wait for my turn to check in at the GRO reception table, maybe you can add 1-2 more GRO?. The valet is free and fast. I got the room that i wanted : city view with balcony, and located in the corner of the building, even though i had to walk like 3 minutes to get to my room, maybe next time will be closer :). I was worried we made some noise when i brought several of my friends there for few hours, but there was no complain so i guess the room was quite soundproof. The experience was great, and certainly now i want to try the villas next time. Let's hope so! :) Two thumbs up for TS Suites Bali."
"1. the welcome drink is a chemical, very sugary, where you need to serve yourself, the feel and look is not compatible with the quality of the hotel. 
2. the breakfast is quite generally nice and a variety of choice but it is not compatible with a 5 star hotel. it is rather a buffet that looks like from a chain hotel. I think a nice buffet and studied should be appropriate and more compatible with the price of your room at TS Suites Bali and Villas.
3. the entrance just before the elevator entrance coming from the parking is rather dark and not welcoming. this is the first thing you see for the TS Suites Bali and Villas coming from the parking. The poor guy sitting there all day, a staff from the hotel, we felt sorry for him to work in that area, because it is dark, there is no window, and hot and no music nothing just a table and a chair
4- swimming pool area, the music, we suggest you to have a playlist ready for the music like lasting a good 2 hour or to have a dj there taking care of the music. because the area is nice, staff nice, but they were pause and no combination of the music. 
5- the mini bar, very nice to have all included, a suggestion will be to provide glasses to drink the sodas, they are only coffee cups. For a five star hotel, you should provide good quality tea and coffee and not lipton brand! 
6- i feel i have paid a bit too much for what it is. the price should be 1.3 million indonesian rupiah at the maximum and not more than this for the suites. 
7- the decoration of the wall in bricks could have been a nicer decoration, it doesnt go with the look and feel of what the TS suites would like to convey. 
8- we feel very sorry for the staff the girls working at the front desk, the uniform is poor and not very good quality, the colors of the uniform are not compatible, it doesnt bring the beauty of your staff out, be careful! we have the feeling we are entering a circus. 
thank you and we hope you can take this constructive feedback."
"We are frequent travellers to Bali and have made a stance to never stay at one hotel twice , However TS Suites may make us break this rule. 
This experience was simply exquisite. Not sure if I should be happy about the greeting driver that picked us up after battling a flight with a 5 month old baby. Or should I mention the fact the hotel sent a big car for just the 2.5 of us to cater for the copious luggage my wife travels with for the baby. 
We arrived at the hotel at 9am and was greeted by lovely staff at reception and foyer. Check in did not start till 2pm , However the staff managed to do whatever they could to make us feel comfortable with our baby until they could make a room available. 
We opted to go to the top floor restaurant and taste the buffet all day dining available at this hotel. The restaurant was very comfortable. We opted to sit on a nice lounge suite where the baby could lie down and get some sleep. As soon as we were seated a lovely waitress offered us freshly made coffee. Walking alongside the buffet , there was a good variety of western, Asian and continental options.  Live egg station and another live station making fresh pancakes. Food looked fresh and lots of attention was given by staff to ensure dishes are topped up. Overall Breakfast is 8/10 from my other experiences. Little more variety is the only suggestion i have.
The restaurant also hosts 2 x pool tables where the staff invited me for a friendly pool competition. Next to the pool tables is a trendy library filled with various books to keep your educated. Also to my surprise was a nice nestled area for children to play with plenty of toys and activities for toddlers. 
Overall experience at Restarant- Staff were amazing. By the second they we were always addressed by our names and our baby was a favourite with the staff. Finally felt like a place where parents with babies were welcomed instead of many places i have stayed where we felt bad bringing baby to breakfast, as staff pi"
"After a horrendous stay at a hotel from hell, coming to TS SUITES was like being in heaven. The pool and bar were 24 hours, the staff were so friendly and couldn't do more. The hotel food was delicious and there's heaps to do from hotel activities, or even a walk to the beach for a romantic sunset as the hotel is in a prime location. The bedroom Tshell suite blew us away- and that's the lowest grade of the suites so I can only imagine what the others are like! An all you can drink mini bar each day included is enough to keep you hydrated... The gym is air conditioned and a great selection of weights- not to mention the little spa ""Ayu"" across the road offers awesome competitive prices by the locals. We will not be changing hotels in Seminyak ever again- can't wait for our next stay! Thank you :)"
"Beautifully designed hotel, spacious throughout, plenty of little quiet places for you to sit and relax right through this hotel. I was truely amazed by the friendly well spoken staff, there manners and friendliness went a long way. Must say was also very impressed with the fact that the infinity pool was open 24/7, so for those nights where you wanted a swim after walking around in Seminyak this was possible regardless of time. The gym was well decked out also. I have been to Bali five times now and i've never stayed in a hotel where the pool is 24/7 so this was a bonus for me. The food at our buffet breakfast was well presented and was delicious. This was a mixed buffet and you could get eggs cooked anyway you desired, and as well as freshly made pancakes. I loved the TS Suites and planning to go back there in November."
"It was definitely a relaxing stay at TS Suites! I loved the hotel so much. It is a very trendy hotel. The infinity pool was just great and in the evening, u can see the sunset. The room is spacious and clean. The bathtub at the side of the room is cool. My husband and I take turns to enjoy a soak in the bathtub while enjoying a glass of wine and watch tv every night. Perfect place for a relaxing and romantic getaway. Located in Seminyak, we can easily catch a cab to Kudeta, Potato Head Beach Club and nice restaurants around the area. The hotel staff also offer excellent service. There's nowhere else I'd want to stay if I go to Bali the next time."
"Location was excellent, ATM round corner, beach 5 minute walk or shuttle on offer every 30 minutes, short taxi journey to seminyak main bars and restaurants, whilst the best nightclub (Jenja) is on the premises.  They also have an excellent Spanish tapas for when you come out.  I loved the design of the hotel with all the intricate brickwork and my TS One Suite was fantastic, whilst the overall amenities are more than satisfactory for any type of traveller, with the complimentary massage a nice touch.  However, the main thing making this a cut above experience were the staff.  They were faultless throughout for me, with exceptional customer care making a massive difference to the point that I don't think id consider any other accommodation in the future in Seminyak because, yes, maybe there are more expensive hotels such as Double 6 in the area which I stayed for 2 nights, but you won't get better value for money from my personal experience. So much so that I returned for an extended stay.  ps I don't generally submit reviews but credit where credit is due, I believe that this hotel deserves to be highly commended."
"My husband and I came to Bali to spend a family holiday with my elder parents. The four of us stayed at TS suites for 10 nights. We had lovely comfortable and fresh modern rooms over looking the courtyard.  My parents were moved to another room due to noise and were generally doted on by the staff who helped in every way they could, at times above and beyond what is expected of hotel staff.  Reading reviews about poor Break-fasts?? Is contrary to what we found, they offer a large buffet with everything from bircher muesli, hot dishes, noodles, toast and pastries, fresh fruit and juices and eggs and omelette cooked to your liking. The pool is a standout and very well appointed with both day beds and lounge tables we spent lots of hours chilling here drinking cocktails and eating satay's and burgers. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and would come again. There were a few teething issues with music type and volume but the hotel was quick to rectify any request. The duck king restaurant downstairs is worth a try, enjoyed a great meal. Although the fresh lobster is really overpriced and will probably die of old age."
"TS Suites Bali and Villas is a hip and very good hotel in the centre of Seminyak. Rooms are very large, with spacious bathrooms including shower and bathtub. Nice to have a all-in price, including use of the minibar. Staff is very friendly and helpful."
"We loved our stay at TS Suites, it was a respite from the traffic chaos of seminyak and the staff went out of their way to make us feel special. Free yoga, free minibar, pool competition, a surprise birthday cake and dance by staff for my husband on his birthday...from the moment we checked in I felt very 'at home' and happy. Our three children shared a sofa bed in the room, which was big enough to easily accommodate them. The bathroom with large freestanding bath was luxurious though nothing was 'over the top' palatial. Mellow dance music played at the rooftop pool which we also loved. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at TS Suites and wish the staff and hotel management the best."
"The service is great! We have issues came urgently, but the staff was very helpful and fast responses. Can’t wait to stay at TS Suite soon"
Wonderful staff great hotel I will stay here again
"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our trip, was such a good hotel. The pool was so nice to relax at. The breakfast had a great range. Also the late checkout was so healthful as we had a midnight flight. A bit of a walk from the beach but they do have a shuttle every hour.  Only thing that we didn’t like was the cost of the drinks at the pool, the drinks were pretty much the same as home once you add the taxes.  Food however was very good value. Would definitely stay again."
"Fun, great location, nice rooms, great amenities, good service. Enjoyed our stay thoroughly."
We stayed at TS suites for 10 days and there wasn't a moment where we were dissatisfied ! Incredible staff cantering to all your needs superb location ... and if you go across the road and speak to a lovely man named Katut he will give you the best tours of Bali for cheap! You can also get scooter hire and laundry done there! Conveniently close to the beach and pharmacy & mini mart all on the same road! Shopping is amazing and the hotel ticks all your boxes! Highly recommended on our end!
"The staffs were really hospitable & quick to help. The  room is clean with quite good amenities. The breakfast was okay.
We also got free drink pass to be used on their own club Jenja, but we didn't use it. They got mini library, pool games, gym & swimming pool and all the facilities were well maintained. The hotel also offer free rides to nearby beach.
Overall it's a satisfactory stay on TS Suites, good value for money."
Wasn’t expecting much. Was very impressed stunning hotel in a very fussy person but this place was exceptional. The room was stunning and I had a standard room with a big modern bath shower and toilet. Very clean . Pool amazing food was amazing. Love it can’t wait to come back.
"The staff in this hotel are simply amazing. I was travelling with a friend, and they made us feel welcome and incredibly valued in every interaction. This left a lasting nice memory.
The breakfast buffet is incredible, and highly worth including with your booking. There’s a high quality selection of consistent western options as well as a couple of local dishes every day.
Location was pretty close to get to most popular places with a car/scooter under 20 mins.
Also highly recommend their Island spa massage/treatment, felt 5 years younger after.
Some bits of feedback that will allow this hotel to go to the next level:
- The bathroom could be cleaned better, I noticed some cobwebs in some corners.
- When getting a spa massage, there were lots of distracting noise from outside that made it difficult to relax, this is because the rooms are close to where people come and go, and the spa reception with the telephone, and the rooms aren’t sound proofed enough."
