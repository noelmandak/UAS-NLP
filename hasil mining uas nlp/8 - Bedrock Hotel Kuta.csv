"We’ve stayed for about a month and enjoyed this hotel for long-term stay. 
Pros:  The room was spacious and very clean, staff friendly and helpful , complimentary tea, coffee , water and welcome drink. A lot of nice cafes nearby and really close to the beach. 
Cons: Wi-Fi a bit slow and unstable, and music near the pool starts at 7 in the morning or so and it’s the same melody every day, you kinda get used to it, but still this might be a bit annoying."
"Walking distance from the airport, couple of good restaurants next to the hotel. Its also close to a beach however, beach is veey dirty.  10 min walking away shopping malls and Starbucks coffee. Pool in the hotel was good. And hotel room was located with a view to airport- room was really quiet. Very good matresses to sleep on and rich breakfast."
"Thank you so much for bedrock hotel to be part of our trip in new year.
All of staff very friendly and helpful. The location verry strategies.
Recommend hotel while u have trip to Bali.
Good luck and Success Bedrock Hotel Kuta...👍🏻🙏🏻😁"
"Nearest beach is like 300m-ish, but such a good walk. Bedroom and bathroom is so clean and its just intl hotel standard equipments. Near shopping mall and food restos. Especially, near the airport which is super convenient.  I would definitely stay here again. Value for money indeed!"
"Im ok with this hotel
Clean..friendly staff
Near to pantai german
Near from mall
All ok la"
"I am amazed with the superb quality and value of the Bedrock Hotel.  Everything was as promised - which was a first for us staying in Bali over a year. The professionalism, courteousness, and exceptional concierge assistance was the highlight for us.  Room service  breakfast was delicious and well presented. We are vegan and the kitchen accommodated our needs. I was able to receive important calls transferred to my room, and the business center was a time saving life saver for me for printing, etc. . Best of all:  peaceful sleep with dark room curtains and thick glass panes, AND we are minutes walk to the beach. We enjoyed  a lovely sunset meal at inexpensive local warung right on the water.  THANK YOU BEDROCK, we HIGHLY recommend and will 100% stay again."
Best hotel at the best location. Value for money. Though the wifi sucks but everything else is so good that the cons can be neglected.
very nice hotel not too expensive but they served you a lot of breakfast menu! very fast check in process!
"Our flight delayed and arrived midnight.  Location about 15mins away from Ngurah Rai Airport. 20mins walk to German Beach and 40mins walk to Kuta Beach. Bali waterbom is nearby 25mins walk. Alot of small souvenirs and craft shop around hotel location. Facilities gym, wadding pool and restaurant. Room and toilet are clean. Took room with breakfast. Breakfast spread are sufficient. Value for money. Recommend this place very much. We book the hotel again when we travel back to kuta."

Love to stay here again! good room with good facilities. Quite close to a mall and have spacious room
Everything is worth it
This good service
"It's walking distance from the airport, which makes this hotel a great stay for the first night when you're tired after your flight. Beyond that, it's far from touristic spot like Legian."
"all is good, i like it"
Very Good and Humble Staff 🙏🏻
Is something like not good in smell
Nice stay in Kuta and affordable
Good hotel
"Every thing was good. Breakfast was also good. Don't miss breakfast. 
However, I asked for water at 11 pm and person at reception asked me to go out and buy water bottle."
Good hotel with affordable prices. Just 1 km from the airport. Malls and beaches are close by as well. We stayed for 1 night as we had to catch an early morning flight. The hotel staff arranged a taxi for us at 4 in the morning. The rooms are big and have attached balcony. In terms of toiletries in the bathroom there wasn't much but it is expected considering the price range. The towels that we got in our room looked old and discolored. The bedsheets were clean and the bed was comfy. It is not a 4-star hotel as shown on google maps but overall it is good for short stay or if you need an affordable hotel close to airport.
"Clean room, friendly staffs, great location with a shopping mall nearby and 24hrs convenient store right outside."
"Amazing staff, close to the airport and was a pleasant transit stay!"
"Clean place, near German beach, suitable for couple or solo traveler. Not recommended for family though because room a bit too small."
Near Airport and Lippo Mall Kuta. You can cross the street to get Circle K. The staff was excellent.
Satisfied for woth of money
All round  pleased with the hotel. Staff very helpful
Near Airport
Pls pay attention for swimming pool
"Great hotel and location. Pool not inviting.  Got to love the disrespect among tenants slamming doors and dragging chairs at all hours , so much that I've just give up and reciprocate."
"Location is strategic near the beach and other.
Staff are helpfull."
"For a solo traveler that it’s their first time on this island, this is your best option. The hotel is near the airport and the beach. The room is clean, the staffs are friendly. Best value for money."
The hotel is gorgeous and the staff are really friendly and accommodating. I would not recommend any of the food in particular the breakfast it is a buffet that consists of cold omelette noodles and rice etc. we booked to use the spa and when we turned up the lady had just started a treatment on someone else despite knowing we were arriving in a few minutes and was quite rude and abrupt in the way she spoke to us which was disappointing. Overall lovely hotel very clean and would stay again. There is also a lovely warung called warung segara across the road I highly recommend here for food.
"The hotels staff and cleanliness is absolutely phenomenal. The rooms were nice, cozy, modern"
"Simple rooms and amenities, especially if out and about.  Breakfast Ok.  Pool needs a good clean.  Can’t really complain as was cheap and what we needed at the time."
Great location if you want to explore kuta area
Highly recommended for couples and family trip
"Great location, close to airport, within distance from Kuta beach & lots of restaurants in the area.  Staff are friendly but the room is a bit dusty. It took a while for the air conditioner to cooling down the air in our room  but we can ask for another swap card so it will allow the air conditioner to run continuously. Apart from that, all are ok.  Fully recommended for budget traveller."
There is no window. Cannot open glass door. It's like not enough oxygen. Morning wake up can get headache like that. Therefore can't stay long.
"The location is superb. Convinient for  Restaurant, money chg,sea side, airport."
"Booked 5 rooms and stayed here for 4 nights, found out that the rooms are not clean. 1 room with water leaking problem, 1 room the bed linen was not changed when we checked in and had bad smell."
They serve indonesia-only breakfast which is a downside for me. Room is okay for what you pay. Location is close to almost all you need.
"overall the hotel situated in great location, near to grocery and souvenir shop, but the staffs were not so helpful and stairs to lift up the heavy luggage"
"Stayed for honeymoon. Overall, room is clean and beautiful set up, staffs are friendly and helpful, breakfast food is acceptable, limited parking except for those who rides in Bali, location is ok."
Air con struggled.  Room nice.
"so far so good ,not the best not the bad too"
This hotel location is good everything nearby bank supermarket malls etc …Wi-Fi is good breakfast is somewhat okay anyway I recommend this place for other guest as I had a good experience with my kids here …maybe in the future I will come back here if I visit Bali with my kids thanks
"Good place to stay for solo, bussines or family"
"The towel in my room were stained with dye shampoo, they asked for compensation idr150.000 even though it could be washed with clothes bleach...very uncomfortable...."
staff always want make some money. otherwise servise is good .
Staff was good during morning but our flight got cancel in the night and we call hotel they just not picking at 10pm . Second when we go back staff was little unprofessionally trained   hotel is clean but rooms needs dehumidifier  lot of moist smell.  Specially lift need exhaust fan or fan. Very much suffocating.. Over all very near to airport in this price.
"Great location, room was OK. towel need to be replaced.  Frontdesk communication & guess handling  skill to be improved"
Kamar nyaman
The hotel is so close to the airport. Rooms are clean but we were given a room with no view . It overlooked to the wall of the next building and we woke up at 4 a.m with some strange sounds coming from the kitchen. Although we called them 3 times they didn't fix it but after 4th time they offered to change the room. We couldn't sleep well and the staff wasn't helpful!
"Very low ceilings, super small room, window does not open,  poor..
I asked stuff to change the room as I cannot sleep without fresh air, they did after long conversation. 
If you like space and have a phobia of closed spaces or if you are very tall this place will be super uncomfortable."
The room size is small. Balcony door is really hard to open and need the staff to gave us the key before open it. The breakfast was not so good and the pool area was not so great.
The towels were so dirty looking. Internet was slow or not working in parts of the room and in the breakfast area.
Good location & Wi-Fi & overall standard breakfast not very good but somewhat okay
Okay place. We paid three times the regular place for New year's eve. Won't complain since the breakfast spread was fantastic. Average place for the price.
It is worth it.
rooms are too small
"Bed sheet is not clean (there are some black spots in the sheet). Same with the bathroom - it looks like it has not been maintaned that well. Breakfast doesn't taste nice. Room is too small. The only pros of this hotel is the location, which is close to the airport and shopping centres. Also plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby. All in all, we will not stay here again in the future."
"Location is good but not recomended since i lost my stuff and they did nothing.
Aircon not cool.
Never back to this hotel"
"Don't be persuaded by the heavily discounted room rate. This is definitely NOT a four star hotel.  It has some serious smells and hygiene issues. As others have said, ""you get what you pay for!"" Also, abysmal wifi connectivity. 
Though to be fair, the staff are very helpful and the location is relatively central to shopping areas and close to the airport for a quick exit."
"Don't prefer if you have better option,
bad rooms
unclean rooms
window opens to wall
bad toilet and lavabo"
Location is good and priced fairly low. But the food is awful but overpriced. Breakfast was edible but was disappointed with lunch and dinner menu every time.
"The description stated exactly that it was a one night stay. not 7 hour room. i have crosschecked with another hotel. management didnt gave a solution, wasted my time, never refund, deflected blame. very bad 
and unprofessional management (third party)."
"Bedrock is the place to arrive in Bali, if you just want to rest a few hours between your stay or waiting to check into another place. Bedrock has clean facilities and comfortable beds. They have a great spa and special rates for guests, we spend hours in the spa each visit and you will not be disappointed. They rates are amazing and most bookings have breakfasts included. So check out the Bedrock it is close to airport and a great place to rest up."
Read the reviews on the bedrock and they seemed very mixed but it was near where I wanted to be so I booked a night and stayed five for the price it was very good value the room was very spacious and had all the mod cons so really couldn’t complain about anything much buffet breakfast a nice clean pool hot shower good air con houseking every day Check in fast and knowledgeable also price matched which I was happy about so all in all would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.
"i like service and fasility from hotel. very near from kuta beach and all menu in our breakfast very good and clean. 
from security until room boy very nice. 
absolutely my traveling at Bedrock Hotel is very awesome.."
We were right in Kuta but away from the hustle and bustle of the chaos. Just a 5 min walk to the quiet beach away from all the resorts and chaos of tourists on a beach.  Breakfast was great and the pool was very nice. Pool located directly in the middle of the hotel which isn't the best if you're looking to take sun for hours but it's was very nice and quiet. The room fabulous and comfortable for such a great price! We couldn't get out of bed it just sucked you in. It was so nice with the balcony over looking the city and not too far away you could see the beautiful ocean. Balcony doors were a special addition to the room. We could have them wide open which brought so much sunlight to the room. Staff was great! Very friendly and ready to help at anytime. We wanted to extend one extra night and they gave us the same room and exact price as we bought it on the app Agoda. Very easy to work with and always smiling. They really seem to enjoy their. I would definitely go back to this hotel.
Hotel staff would let me put any food orders on my room tab so I had to pay for all room service in cash which really let down the whole experience as that’s one of the luxuries of staying in a hotel! Also the lunch/ dinner menu was very limited. Other than that bedrock hotel was a great place to stay.
"We (two elderly ladies) spend 2x2 nights in Bedrock hotel.It was all over great.
From the minute we first arrived the staff was friendly and very helpful, the hotel was always clean, the breakfast good with a nice selection and the lovely pool a blessing in the heat. The location  is excellent, about 600 meters from  Lippomall several nice restaurants  and the beach within easy walking distance.Taxis always available about 50 meters from the hotel.
Althought close to the airport  we never heard any noise, it was all over very quite.Will recommend to anybody"
"Had a very nice stay at the Bedrock Hotel. Definitely recommend adding the buffet breakfast with your stay as I was very impressed with the variety of food every morning and very happy that there is a proper coffee machine available! The rooms were very nice, although my room on the first floor for the second half of my stay was quite noisy in the mornings as it was directly above the lobby.
Otherwise very happy with the rooms and made good use of the gym during my stay. Would definitely stay here again!"
"Me and my boyfriend booked two nights here. This is extremely extended our expectation. Very friendly staffs and even the security staff will be there and greet u all the time! Hotel room is clean and right enough for us two with two bottles of free mineral water per day. Hotel even have a small swimming pool. Location is good. Cheap massage and motor rental is just nearby. 5-10mins to Kuta beach or Lippo mall. You can also find a few local restaurants nearby. Compare to the price, this will definitely be one of the best choice!"
"This is a quite new hotel, the staff are very friendly, the design is stylish including some details. 
Breakfast was buffet and selections are quite good. 
It's not at the central of Kuta, you walk 20 mins north to discovery mall and in traffic taxi charge 50k to reach the central Kuta area.  But still recommends if you don't want to stay in central Kuta all the time. To airport is convenient and close. There are some spas and good restaurants around. A new shopping mall Lippo Mall is about 300 meters away."
"Location is so good only 5 minutes from Airport and near kuta beach, many place for eat or just shopping around. Next to hotel is bike rent.
What else? Pool is too small, breakfast is not bad, room is standard.
Overall its good experience to stay for only 1-2 days if you have limited time in Bali."
"Amazingly nice for the price and location. We needed to transit in Bali for one night only. So we booked a hotel that's close to the airport. We were impressed specially for the price we paid. 
The hotel is so clean and new, bed and pillows were so comfortable. Located 3-5 minutes by car from the airport (but on the way to the airport some roads were closed and the traffic was re-route, took us about 15 minutes to the airport)."
"Me and my husband was going to Bali. We booked for 4 nights in this hotel. My first impression for this hotel, it’s quite beautiful and luxury looks from outside. The staff also was very friendly and very humble. My review for room, everything is okay, clean and beautiful but it’s not a big room like in the picture. The bathroom also was clean. But the water from shower is quite smelly, so i need to let shower go on about 3 minutes to let go the smells. In addition, the hotel also near with rent bike shop, so it’s easy for you guys to rent a bike. The hotel also was near with city. So far everything is okay."
"Clean, convenient and great value. Just a short stopover as arrived late, Bedrock ticked all the boxes. Food available 24hrs and reasonable quality and price. Will stay again."
"The Bedrock hotel was fantastic value as the hotel was modern and well equipped. Located close to the airport and plenty of shops, this is an ideal place to stay if you're going to the airport early the next day."
The hotel is situated near the airport. You can walk from the airport without any problem to Bedrock Hotel.   This hotel is 5 minutes from the beach walk.  Rooms are ok and quite  clean but  air condintions  I think is the main problem.  Avoid  314 room number.  That room is opposite  the housekeeping  room. It's always noisy.  Breakfast was above basic. You can get some  Indonesian boring cusine. Mostly Nasi Goreng which everyday they preapred in different way. (funny).  If you are bored of eating  every day  fried  noodles and rice  you can always get some omelette and  boiled eggs if you ask for. I saw some fruits and indonesian saussage but I did'nt  try.  Coffe is fine and good. Nearby area is  calm and safe.
"We arrived in Bali in the middle of the night and had to fly to other destination the next day. This hotel couldn't be more perfect for that. 
If i could add something for future improvement, the housekeeping was a bit frustrating (literally took them an hour ) to check on available extension and came back to say 'no'. And the swimming pool location is a bit unsual, to say the least. well, at least for me who won't caught dead swimming in the middle of hotel lobby."
"Convenient location, new rooms with amenities and ample breakfast options. Staff are nice or for that matter too nice and some staff are not experienced to deal with difficult situations (no action from frontdesk when my next door (room 512) guest kept smoking late night and early morning on 2nd October  in the non-smoking room that filled my room with strong smoke smell through the adjoining door. Staff simply said couldn't stop him from smoking instead of calling the guest and telling him to stop and even fining). Despite that experience, I think Bedrock is a good value for money. Also, request management to have a strict policy for rule breakers."
"A really great deal! Even with a 4-year-old child in tow, we found the location close enough for walking to find food, beach, shopping, massage etc... It's nice and quiet not on the main strip of Kuta and very close to airport. The walk to the main Kuta Beach is a bit far but you can take a cheap taxi ride there. We found it easier to walk along the wide path along the ocean rather than in the narrow sidewalks of town. With a decent breakfast included, very comfortable bed and room, this was an excellent deal. Staff was very nice and helpful.  Pool is small but ok for cooling off.  Would stay there again."
"We got a good price for 2 nights there. The only thing that I think Bedrock should improve is the buffet breakfast, or maybe Indonesian food is not our taste."
"It's on the edge of Kuta, u gotta walk a distance to get to the beach. However, right outside the hotel is a myriad of restaurants and El Toro is right beside it. Local cuisine at its doorstep is VERY cheap, could get ayam penyet for $1.80. The staff are friendly, and service you request it is delivered promptly. Although hotel is not big, but facilities are impressive. They have a spa, a small pool, a small gym and you can also have shisha at the bar. If you are on a budget, this is an excellent choice. You can rent a bike across the road for 100 000rupiah a day."
"Near Airport, Jerman Beach, Lippo Mall Kuta, Waterboom, Etc. 
Hotel Quite Good, room big and clean.
Bathroom its Ok. If you want feel a different kuta, less indonesian people please come here. 
Breakfast ok. But need more various at menu. 
Overall Good and satisfied. :)"
