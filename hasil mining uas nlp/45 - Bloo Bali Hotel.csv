"Sadly I was staying for one night only for the transit before my next travel to my next destination. This hotel is worth to visit.
The staff, facility, cleanliness, and many other element are just good. and well they have a big swimming pool and my room was upgraded to the Swimming pool view. That's terrific! 
I love this place so much and of course I already think to come back to stay here again for one more time."
"Stay here 6 days 5 nights with very affdorable price in agoda!
Booked a king size room 421 if not mistaken.
Really want to room move but they dont have any king size on different side. I enjoy my overall stay here but not the noise every night until 1AM from live music next door of the hotel. 
They supposed to anticipate this one with other side of room in a king size bedroom.
I am pretty light-sleeper, so it means a lot for me."
"It's very close to city, you can go anywhere easily, near restaurants and salon. Room was very clean with helpful staff. Definitely going to stay here again if i'm going back to Bali."
"what a lovely place, the staff are so kind, the hotel is clean and the pool was great. the place is in the center of kuta, so you're very close to pantai kuta etc. we'll comeback for sure"
"One of the best hotel we stayed in Bali. The room was big, the staffs are attentive to our requests, the facilities are great. Location is great, near restaurants and coffee shops and Krisna Oleh Oleh (Souvenir Shop). We will definitely book again when we visit Bali again."
The location of the hotel was excellent! Plenty of restaurants near the hotel as well. Check-in was smooth and easy. The room was true to the photos. Staffs were polite and friendly. Would love to come back here again when I'm in Kuta.
"Nice staff, Room is always clean and huge, really worth the price, strategic location."
"I stayed here for 3 nights, overall everything is good enough in this hotel. But the 1 thing that I don’t like is the water, the water is from sumurbor that makes"
"Best location.. a lot parking space . Good staff and fast response.. a lot of food and restaurant near hotel..
Keep good ambience.. and performance..
Increase cleanliness of corridor and room terrace..."
Location is great! Value for money is very good. Clean and comfortable. Easy to reach.
"This hotel although looks ""just' okay' in the outside, but for me it's just awesome in the inside. The room is bigger than any other budget hotel.  The room is also clean and also has a desk to use as a work desk. Oh I also like a  long couch near the window (since when budget hotel has a couch).
The location of the hotel also near many restaurants, warung, cafe, and food court. So. it's just perfect!"
Food heaven around hotel. Staff really friendly. Clean. Neae with airport
"Surrounded by many restaurants and good food in general. Also good location, only a few minutes drive away from tourist attractions
Spacious rooms, well decorated and maintained. Very homey"
"I stayed solo at a room for 4 pax. The price was very affordable and the room is very spacious. Will consider to stay here again when Im in Bali with tight budget.
Locationwise - 8.5 out of 10."
"clean.
hot water.
cool ac.
what else"
"Definitely will come back again to stay at Bloo. Kamar tidur & kamar mandinya luas, the staff are so friendly.."
Excellent service.. good location.. increase cleanliness of corridor and room terrace.. keep good atmosphere and good performance..
"Hotel is very accessible to numerous minimart, massage place. Its a whole street of delicious and affordable food. 
Best place to stay"
"I like to stay here,  all the staffs really nice and friendly"
"I book this hotel for 1 night only because of the location and not far from airport.  For 3 star hotel, the room is big, quite old, quite clean but worth the price. Many restaurant around and at night many ""angkringan"" pop up. The location is also good"
"surprisingly good for this kind of rate. Clean, spacious room, comfortable bed. Location is also a huge advantage of this hotel, many restaurants, warung and cafe are around the hotel."
Thank you everyone.. See you next week. I booked another one for transit going to airport..
I booked 5 hotels in my trip to bali and really this was the best in everything
"Definitely a good location, easily accessible to other location and variety of food nearby"
Dah gabisa kata” the best
good price & quality for budget hotel...but sometime the price become very expensive
"Convenience, distance to airport is moderate, about 30 minutes."
"I love this place. My 2nd stayed and it was still
The same even in Corona Situation only this time they don’t have restaurant but it’s not a big deal because you could find many restaurants nearby by foot as well.
Will always come back to this place as my favorite hotel"
Twin room will be more quiet at night
Nice place to stay
"The hotel is very spacios and clean. The bathroom floor is too slippery, the water feels a bit oily. But the rest is good. Good location near supermarket, drug store, and best hawker food around the hotel. Will be back for sure. Thx"
The staff is so friendly and helpful. Thanks!
"Recommended Hotel ! Clean, cheap and feels like home"
Nice to stay
Still clean n good location
"the location is excellent, easy to access and near many shops and cafes. near to seminyak and kuta /legian beach. The room is spacious and clean. But the hotel need more concern about the bathroom cause the floor in shower room a bit slippery.  The price is absolutely worthed."
Sangat menyenangkan menginap disini
3 times stayed here and definitely will come back again
Very good hotel
"Really satisfied with this hotel during my stay in Bali. The location is great with food options nearby. 
Wished that there is a gym in the hotel and bath tub in the room. 
Overall, would recommended this hotel! Great price, good staff and great location!"
"Like the other hotel on Dewi Sri street, blOo offered great location. It has big room with great price. The room was good enough for business traveler like me."
Reasonable price for such a nice hotel. Highly recommended 😀
Clean and easy to get out and about hotel. Friendly staff. Kids enjoyed the pool
"Value for money : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Location : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Cleanliness : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Staff : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
We’ll be back for sure!"
Very clean

Great location
Will come again bloooo
highly recommend this hotel with cheap price. And the staffs are all nice.
"So far suka inap disini krn kamar bersih, ga bau, dkt pusat kota dan makanan. Overall okay lah inap sini. Tp problem muncul dng karyawan di hari2 terakhir. Worse than i thought. Say sorry aja kaga. Hadeuh banget deh..jd bikin illfeel n bad memories"
Nice place to stay and affodable price.
"Good location, affordable price during high season"
"i chose twin bed room, i was shock when i saw the room really big and comfy!"
Don't take breakfast.. dangerous for small children in above floors because walls are short..no shower bidet in toilet...big rooms.. clean swimming pool.. polite staff...car parking.. good location
"Near cafe n restaurants. Big room n clean but sound proof room not good, u can hear sound from outside"
"Pros:
1- big and comfortable bed & pillow
2- room big enough to perform muslim prayer
3- complete amenities
4- location is walkable to find bali food
Cons-
1- the balcony is very dirty like no one clean this side ever 
2- the water is a bit oily. Be careful when u take shower. Very slippery floor."
One of the best hotel in Bali. Trust me
"+ : The location is strategic, many restaurant nearby. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room big enough. 
I have a problem in the shower because the water is clogged, but can be fixed in 1 hour. 
The last, from our room there is live music from the restaurant in front of the hotel, it is quite loud every day until 12 at night starting around 8"
"Friendly staff and good swimming pool
Good location - Close to Ikea and Papaya mart and Grand lucky mart and local restaurants and Ice cream shop 👍
Minimalism facility 
No shampoo and conditioner and soap prepared, but there is liquid wash(?) dispenser in shower and bath room
No antibug screen - better buy an electric mosquito repellent 
x2 bath towels only , no facial towel and hand towel
Pool towel available at front desk
No drying rack and not able to use balcony fence for hang up swimming gears
Good value for money"
"The receptionist said there was a glitch when I booked my room. However there was no communication at all from the property that say that the room I booked was unavailable. The receptionist said that Agoda didn’t give my contact number or email to the property. Hence, they gave me 2 rooms on the top floor n free breakfast for my kids (after I complained about the incident).. 
There was no towel in one of the room. Just realized on the next day."
I always love to stayed here if I have some appointments in Kuta area. Love the room spaces
"Good location,big room,cheap,and reccomended"
"Location is good, along a street with restaurants and shops selling pastries ideal to gift others. Also near Sunset Way which is one of the rare multi-lane road for easier access to attractions. Room itself is rather clean but there are ants in the room, especially the toilet where there are many. Restaurant is totally empty other than for breakfast and there are flies flying around."
Nice and clean place for a cheap hotel
Everything in this hotel work as an order but it was school holiday and the hotel were packed and sometimes you can still hear the noise through corridor till at night which is annoying especially when you want to have good night sleep.
Will come again
"Plus: affordable price in prime location with large room size
Minus: a bit noisy at night due to next to cafe/resto with live music, room need to be maintain and clean properly"
"For short stay is ok, but the facilities are minimum and the hotel are in need of renovations n maintenance.
The balcony door was rusty and it keep banging to room and also the towel colors are worn out, the pillow & the pillow sheet need to be renew.
But generally, it's ok."
Near many kind of restaurant or warung or traditional food and cheap off clurse
It's the best location you will ever had
"I work online and I really struggled during my stay here for 6 days to do any kind of work at all on my computer.
The WiFi was so slow. Tried to phone the reception about this but they didn't pick up, when I used my normal line, they picked my phone call up. I couldn't even open my Google calendar for a simple check. 
Normally, when I don't get proper access to WiFi, I'd use my 4G (with a local SIM), and I didn't get enough coverage and speed in the room too. It was so bad I had to keep on going out every single day to work. Considering this, no value to money at all.
Other than that, the housekeeping team was thorough."
Hotel is conveniently located within 3km of kuta beach with limited parking lots so might be hard to get a lot during peak season. Check in was smooth and fuss free. The room is decently sized at 300 sq ft but room was very basic. Housekeeping wasn't up to scratch as the room was left unkept even with the 'make up room' tag on the door. Only upon request did they send someone to tidy the room. Breakfast wasn't very good but service was at least fairly efficient. The pool's filtration system probably wasn't working as the water was murky and green in colour. Overall the hotel looks newly refurbished but maintenance was generally sub par.
"Don’t rely on Wi-Fi  or reception for phone, non existent. Room cleaning second rate & late"
Thankyou
"This place is compact and comfy. For the price I paid, this is in a great locale with lots of eateries around. It has amenities like a restaurant, bar and swimming pool too."
"Recommended place to stay! The family room was awesome. Large room space, large bathroom space. And the great thing for smokers, they have balcony"
overall is a nice place to stay. value for money. very humble & polite staff.
"Hotel bagus bersih kamar luas. Tempat strategis banyak tempat makan, minimarket."
"Lokasinya sangat strategis, banyak tempat makan juga di sekitar hotel. Hotel bagus bersih kamar luasss. Puas menginap di bloo"
"the room is clean and nice, the price are good, near to kute and there's a lot of store near the hotel, the staff r nice, but too bad the hotel was actually near to a club so it was really noisy at night"
At $15 night with large room.cool aircon. Nice pool. Bargain. Need transport
The location is near to shop lot kike indo mart/kopi kenangan/resto and easy to find ojek /public transportation.
"The best location in Bali. You can find anything you are looking for in Bali within walking distance. The room is clean, spacious and the ammenities are good. The staffs are nice and helpful. Overall, a great hotel."
"Second time here. I love because this hotel is clean, large room and good location."
It's a pleasure stayed at Bloo Bali Hotel because it's clean and modern. I hope Bloo Bali Hotel will keep maintaining the cleanliness and quality. I'll be back soon :)

"So Clean, good facilities, worth of money . The pool is nice"
What a great place
Nice place at city beach. Clean
the hotel was so clean and also had a great staff
"The room is spacious and clean. However, no hair dryer. I’m kinda suspicious with the drinking bottled water. Reasonable price for breakfast and dinner buffet. Need fee minutes walk to go to the night markets and beachwalk though. Few restaurants nearby but overall it’s a great place and great service."

Nearby to restaurants
"Location :best

Cheaaap"
Must visit hotel... Good location. Easy access.
Love the decorations... and helpful workers. Love the vibes.
Staffs are all kind and helpful. The room is huge for a budget hotel. Really enjoyed our stay.
For now we think that Bloo hotel is the best budget hotel in Bali. Big room big bed big toilet. Easy to park. Very recommended. Will visit again next time to Bali. 10/10. Thank you
"Great deal hotel with spacy and clean room, strategic location across main road"
"i have bad experience here, even i already ask to change room and get the new one but still has a poor aircon, staff not friendly, towel seems old and not good, 
good swimming pool, a lot of foreigner stays here
i dont wanna stay here anymore. thanks"
"pemilihan dengan tanpa sarapan adalah pilihan yang baik dengan posisi hotel yang sangat dekat di mana pun, termasuk dekat dengan Kuta Selatan maupun ke pintu tol Benoa ke Nusa Dua. Dekat dengan SBBP (Sate Babi Bawah Pohon) dan sangat baik ke arah Ubud. AC yang dingin dengan kamar yang sangat luas adalah hal yang sangat baik dan saya akan kembali lagi ke hotel ini. saya tidur dengan kualitas yg baik dan merencanakan trip dengan istriku dengan sangat baik.
the choice without breakfast is a good choice with the hotel's position being very close to anywhere, including close to South Kuta and to the Benoa tollgate to Nusa Dua.  Close to SBBP (Sate Babi Bawah Pohon) and very good towards Ubud.  Air conditioning in good conditions, with a very spacious room is a valuable and I will come back to this hotel. i slept very well and planned a trip with my wife to zero mistake."
All good except the flooring in the shower room. Please change the vinyl floor. It is too slippery
"The rooms are big & ok, but their breakfast are bad"
"The room was clean, the price was cheap than other with swimmingpool facility. Highly recommendation."
Great little family hotel very clean & comfy
Love the place . Best hotel in bali . Cheap & clean .
