"This is in the perfect location, down a road just off the main road. Very quite, clean and the staff go above and beyond. The pool is amazing!  There is a convenience store right across the road. We were also able to store one of our bags here for the month while we travelled around Bali."
"Went to Bali for a two day trip. My objective was to explore the place on an economical way yet not compromising on comfort. Transera provided me all of that
Positive points about the property:
1. Value for money
As an Indian i found this property really less expensive, at this price we generally get lodge. The hotel provided all the basic amenities at very less price.
2. Ideal location
Property was near the airport and near beaches and some happening clubs. So no transportation cost if you want to hit clubs and ⛱️.
3. Center point for pick up
The tourist companies were offering services to pick u up from the hotel so accessibility never was a problem. It was surrounded by 24 hours marts.
4. Spectacular ambience
The property has a nice ambience, nice outdoor swimming pool, rooms with balcony, spacious rooms, kettle , dental kit. 
Services
They were awesome, i had to leave early, they provided me with packed breakfast. They were fast and prompt in their actions. Though language is an issue so advice is to use a translator.
Things that can be improved
If you are looking for variety of food, you will be disappointed. If they upgrade their menu, it would add one more star to their feedback.
Limited rooms 
The rooms in this property is limited"
"Excellent location, and very clean. Staff were amazing, always available if we needed anything. The pool was wonderful. We stayed here with our two young kids, and would definitely stay here again. Very close to restaurants and the beach."
"We stayed here for 2 nights and everything was great. The staffs were handy and very friendly, they helped us with scooter rental and taxi service as well. It’s kinda peaceful place to stay, just off the art market street around 3-5 minutes so you can stay away from the big crowds a little bit. I preferred to walk from here to Kuta beach, just 12 minutes .you don’t really need a scooter at all if you wanna explore the centre of Legian and Kuta beach. The only problem was the smell of the toilet. Overall it’s a good place"
"This hotel exceed the value of money, it's in the center of the town Kuta,night life here is hectic and yes the traffic in night is chaos too but despite this the staff, breakfast and amenities here is top notch! 5 Star!"
"The pool was awesome, the rooms great. Even better was Enny shop across the road. Ask them for anything you need and no problem."
"This hotel is beautiful. Big rooms. Comfy beds. Clean. I love the balcony, I can hear the birds and trees swaying it’s those sounds I was missing about bali. Pls bring a travel adaptor as they only have the local plug in. Wifi is not good so I was on data, which is fine. Don’t use the minimart across the street it’s more expensive, try the shop next to it. Pool is beautiful too. Staff is lovely. There is a kettle, coffee and tea in room, and also a fridge which is so helpful. I love this hotel and I will be back. Thank you Transera 🤍"
"the hotel provides a relaxing place to stay, and their staff were so accomodating ad helpful, and the location is within everything you need .... perfect for a week-long stay."
"Stayed for 3 nights.  We were given  the room in the second floor. The room was spacious, clean and nice.  The hotel would clean your room daily giving us new clean fresh towel everyday. We were using a car to travel around Bali, although parking was small, it can be helped by the friendly staff. This hotel should be on top of my list because its cheap, clean and in the middle of legian/kuta 👍🏼"
"Room is very clean, staff were kind and very close to airport."
"Very very nice the location in the central of tourism area , and easy to going anywhere place by walking"
"Very strategic!!! near bali bomb monument and also kuta beach and beachwalk mall.
but the hygiene could be improved, but it's appropriate according to the cheap price."
"Nice room with big bathroom, just up the road is a lovely restaurant called ground zero. We only stayed 1 night, but we did walk to beach in about 15 min and lots of restaurants just a couple mins away. Nice staff, nice pool. 
They also sorted out transport for us the next day!
We reccomend!"
"We liked our stay at kamini, nice pool, friendly staff, all around a very pleasent stay. Location is also very nice."
"Love stayed here. The location is near bom bali monument. 
The room is clean but i found a bunch of ciggaretes at the bottom of wastafel. 
The rest is okaay"
Perfect location. Near to everything.
"Clean and cozy rooms with a balcony  , a proper swimming pool. My only concern was rice/noodles for breakfast but this is normal here."
The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
I giving review because of the location otherwise I would not giving any because do not have a chance to visit Bali as the pandemic strike. Will try again next 2 years inshaAllah
"I recommend this hotel for the price. 
You can’t complain I’ll be back. Only one thing is that no movie channels. Thanks for looking after me the team atTransera hotel."
"pertahanin harga dan kualitasnya ya, the best venue at bali"
"I was pleasantly surprised to find out how peaceful and serene this place was even if it’s so close and accessible to pubs, clubs, restaurants and shops.  A 10 min walk away from the beach and world renowned 🌅 sunsets"
The location is awesome
Hotel and staff was great
"It's good but not like the pics and i was coming from other hotel which was so great so when i review this hotel i feel that i am unfair with it because the previous hotel was in lower price but was more great than this one ,, so it is good hotel but not like pictures"
Best LARGE ROOM and PRIVATE ❤❤❤🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️😫 i love
"The place is worth with the price, location in the center and very stalrategic, clean and friendly. But, need improvement for the breakfast."
Transera Kamini is located in a really great location. And yet it was not noisy and felt like an escape from the busyness of Jln Legian.
Quiet spot but great value for money. Staff are excellent.
"Nice hotel, but would need a little refresh.... The location is great at walking distance from the beach and still close to the airport, so you can still enjoy a party out and get your flight chilled. Pool is great. Good value for your money"
Great hotel and staff also location was amazing
"Very nice place to stay in kuta, the room are clean and tidy the only things it's the shower they need to clean it a bit more, we find hair from the precedent customer.. And the water had a smell of sulfur... The staff it's lovely ! And the swiming pool very clean !"
I was really happy with our stay. Paid less than $70aud for 2 nights and the room was really clean and no bugs or mozzies. It would be perfect if it's near the beach though.
"Very friendly staff. 
Bare bones hotel. 
Basic hot breakfast. 
New water delivered each day. 
Toilets flush. 
Water is hot most of the time. 
Wi fi worked in one room - not the other. 
Door latch didn’t work
Balcony door didn’t lock
No lift
But hey … Worth the budget price. 
Would stay again. Kids were happy."
Strategic location and big room! Very near to Bom Atoment Bali and Beachwalk mall
Good place to stay. Recommended! And very near to legian street n kuta beach thats the point 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"Great choice for budget travelling, they have swiming pool, and good service."
It's good but not like the pictures
"Large room, large bathroom, Good staf"
"Good room for people on the budget. Value for money. For the money I paid I expected the worst room, but I couldn’t  complain."
"Quite ok. Staffs are very friendly, but the blanket need to be washed"
Its worth it between prive and quality. Recommended
"The Hotel was cosy and nice. Only that I dislike is their breakfast. Not much varieties. Suggest to have more varieties so can choose for People stay more than 4 days. 
Overall was good"
Nice staycation
You get what you pay for. Good hotel to bump in after a long day spent outside and great location.
Masyuuukkk..
Perhaps my luck isn’t good that time. The water pressure is low. Somehow it is kind of out to date hotel. Saw pieces of furnitures has worn out.
"I dont know maybe because i solo travel and got a corner room, so i feel creepy and dark."
Breakfast wasn’t good and wifi as well
"Originally I planned on staying for one month but after checking in I realized  the place is not suitable for long term stay. It could be a great place if they fixed a small details:
- walls in dire need of new paint
- room size is decent but there is no desk and chair. You can only sit on the bed while eating, working on laptop etc
- breakfast is a joke. You need to order the day before what you want and what time. Quality is mediocre at best and the portion is smaller that my cat eats for lunch.
All in all, place has potential, the staff is wonderful, bed is comfortable, location is good (if you like Legian/Kuta), room size is decent, place is quiet but unless they fix these issues I will not return."
Good location
Can't expect much. Value for money. Don't imagine with pictures and dream like merriot or etc range. But worth for money been paid. Initially offered smaller room with no balcony n single mattress in bad condition. Upon asking it was changed.
"Nice room, big room, cheap also. Nearest was nice, no bored"
"But the room is not clean enough, the aircon was not good, it’s really hot.."
"The room's bathroom was not that clean and broken equipments. Although, the room was big and decent. Hotel wifi was slow. Breakfast was below okay. Place is near to nice places though."
"I’m a discreet widowed mother with 2 small boys, currently in the middle of a one month stay at Kamini. Accommodation is good , but we have been very upset numerous times as staff does not respect required social & physical distancing. I chose this hotel because of the more upscale amenities -like a room phone for communication with front desk. Unfortunately several of the male staff have touched my children and excessively engaged with them after we asked for personal boundaries. One in particular repeatedly disturbs us when we are alone. I have lost my nerve and told them with emotion to stop. Two workers have eagerly followed and teased my 8 yr old with unacceptable familiarity, beyond the “friendly Balinese” style. (We have been in Bali since January). One had his face close my child to see what he was writing in his school book. He also placed both hands on my child’s shoulders without consent. Another put his hand on my child’s waist, and my kid actually said: “pls don’t touch me.”
  I have seen several Indonesian guests come and go. One was a woman alone with 3 small children. We did not witnessed the staff approach her or her children at all, much less with indiscretion. They were treated with respect and in compliance with the hotel’s distancing policies. I am especially perplexed because today we were rinsing off sand in beach wear at the outdoor shower.. My 10 yr old was “keeping guard” because we have come to expect their untimely advances, especially when the hotel is empty as it is now. My son alerted me that “he’s coming he’s coming!”  The 3 of us huddled in the corner with our backs to him as he repeatedly said “excuse me, excuse me.” I said loudly: “No! I prefer not to speak now.” He continued to approach us until I  demanded he leave and use the hotel phone to communicate.
  The female receptionist also entered  my room without knocking as I was resting in bed just after check in.  We asked to be moved upstairs and thankfully they DID.  The upsta"
"Hi
Nice location
No lift
Poor service"
"Cleanlines : 4/10
Fasilities : 4/10
Staff : 6/10
Locatoin : 6/10"
"Never ask for a service such as laundry  , they refuse to give you back your clothes  if you don't have the cash at the moment , then they keep your clothes . terrible way to treate people ,like criminals."
Cheap if travelling on a budget. But some things shown can be misinterpreted. When they say breakfast is included. It means A meal during breakfast time is included. I was probably just unlucky with my room as I received an older unit. Couldn't move because it was full.
Agoda and Transera hotel owed me money for outsourcing my request for wheelchair. After three successive emails to making such request yet both Agoda and Transera failed to inform me. I wouldn't be staying there had I knew the answer.
"Breakfast was horrible...
There was no restaurant and they served the breakfast in the room.
Room has smoking smell and the doors are sliding which seems not safe"
Great hotel
Close to everywhre
"The room had a bed and tv. The walls had flaking paint due to moisture and the same in the bathroom. The bathroom looked grimy with leaking water pipe und the basin and also a toilet leaking water onto the bathroom floor. The soap suds on the  shower glass was not cleaned off in a very long time. It just gave an unclean feeling, overall a terrible experience and not up to standard. Glad that we only had to stay one night."
"Toilet smelly like shit even i just entering the room, not even using it. The smell come from the sewage toilet bowl i guess. 
Dirty hotel, there is lizard and frog outside my room, and also got lizard inside the room.
Facilites not good enough, the walkaway at the swimming pool look old and not safe.
No lift or elevator, hard if your room at higher place thinking to going down and bring the luggage."
2 rooms missing their things. 1 new box ciggarate and 1 bottle vape flavour.. We regret on this matter. Also the bathroom dirty and curtain got bloods.
"The worst ever experience of staying in hotel. Very old hotel, poorly maintained, lacks basic facilities, no kitchen available in hotel,  breakfast is arranged from street vendor opposite to it, highly discourtious and ill mannered staff. Not suitable for families."
"Couldn’t last 10 minutes in this hotel, 
Floor full of ants, bed with cockroaches and filthy and dirty hotel. Never stay here again. I had to lose my 2 nights booking money paid but couldn’t stay in that filthy place."
"No satellite tv as advertised and old man wetting his pants infront of me in lobby… misguided by staff trying to contact Agoda , who were no help…."
"Very nice location if you want to be near Legian area where there are a lot of bars, restaurants, and stores. Quite far to the beach but manageable. Breakfast is just ordinary nothing special so i recommend to just eat outside for fussy ones. the room is spacious but a bit disappointed because of the cracks inside the room; the picture looks nicer."
We absolutely love our room. It is a little bit crowded outside since it close to Legian street yet it close to the restaurants and cafes. The breakfast was kinda below my expectation
"We had book 3 Room for 3 night , this is the same complaint as per below :

1. Air-conditioning inside the room ,filled with incorrect location,Lying in the bed, totaly cannot feel the cool air . Is hot at the night. 2. Water Heater is Unstable ; Suddenly cold suddenly hot; 3.Because the aircon is not cold, so we had inform counter we no need room service and we keep the aircon open until we back. But once we back hotel , someone had go inside our room and close all the power supply, our room like sona .they didn't get our approve just simple go inside our room , this position we cannot except. 4.Hotel include breakfast, but the hotel restaurant is without aircon or fan. their breakfast is only 2 bread with butter + coffee or tea only ."
Closer to Night Clubs (Legian  Street). Nice pool. There are two buildings in hotel. Pool view building is quite good view. Calm and serene environment. Breakfast is good.
"It is not a five star, but for his cost this Hotel is very good, location is perfect, 3 minutes walk to the Kuta central Street, laundry, massage, two supermarkets, warung and tatoo salon are Just across the Street from Hotel entrance.
When we were there, there stayed Russia tourists whether were drinking, shouting and screaming, but nothing was bad from the Hotel side."
"Very good view from hotel. I got room with 1 kind bed and 1 small bed. Suitable for family that has 3 persons.
The room is quite big. It has open-air bathroom with hot shower and bathtube.
 The staffs are very nice. Breakfast are good test and served to our room in the morning."
"Good location and massive clean room, comfortable bed, breakfast is great for not much more and until 11am which is good, no hot water though as machine always broken, and in room safe you have to ask at reception as they only have 3 for the whole hotel, and non are bolted down so pretty pointless"
"Only had 1 night here & arrived last after our flight. Everything was great for what we payed except the shower was cold. Didn't worry to much about it thou. Nice pool & comfortable bed. Even had blackout curtains.
Ok place & fantastic location is u wanted to hit the main part of kuta to party.  Room was quite, couldn't hear any of the clubs."
"Very good location, if you like night parties and affordable place, then this is for you. Once we arrive we requested to change for 2 single bed in a room, and they easily grant our request. The staff are friendly and accommodating."
"Everything was great. 
Spacious room.
Comfortable bed.
Good location. Even located at the middle of Club area, suprising its quiet. I had a good sleep during my 3 nights stay.
Friendly staff."
"Sangat tidak nyaman karma staff hotel selalu membuat tidak nyaman, pagi2 masih tidur sudah di tlp in untuk cek out dan sangat tidak profesional system kerjanya."
"The water boiler in my room was very dirty. The breakfast was still okay. Anyway, the staffs are nice."
Very big room and places for your stuff. The service is good and on time. Very cozy and loved was there.
"The rooms are looking well, but they wasn't very clean. 
Towels and bedlinen was dirty too.
Breakfast is poor: just some toast with butter and marmalade, a cup of tea and some slices of fruit.
Beside the Hotel, they build up a new hotel, so you always having the noise of the construction work. 
They only good think, the hotel is very closed to the Kuta Party area with Skygarden, Engineroom,..."
"value for money, good location , and overall ok"
"very close to the night club, walking distance to beach and very nice hotel ambience"
"big room, good selection of cable tv and the staff is super duper helpful"
Value for money.
Lovely rooms and clean
Everything was nice and good only the breakfast was nearly nothing.
No hot water no tv channels no in room safe no were to hang your clothes no safety deposit box .
AC wasn't working well. Not sufficient lights for the room. No toiletry kit in washroom.
"Nice place, worth money you pay for it."
"I was satisfied, excellent."
"I stayed for a month their, so when I tell you the hotel staff was great I really mean it. They were very kind and polite, they go the extra mile to take care of your needs, and they were on time with breakfast.  As we get to breakfast there’s only about 3 options you can choose but for the most part it was decent. The location brings the hotel alive because it’s only a short walk to the main road, where everything is happening. You have the night life, the beach, food and restaurants, and of course shopping. Also food delivery almost forgot . My overall experience was good and would stay their again."
"clean, good facilities,"
"The room, towels, bed everything smells like mud. Shower don't work properly, it takes ages to shower. Breakfast is not good. Only good thing about the hotel is their staff are nice.. apart from that, the hotel seriously needs renovation."
"I got a discount so only paid about $25 a night for the superior room which was good value.
Staff are very accommodating and friendly.
Nice pool but a bit too much chlorine and the party music perhaps a bit loud in the daytime"
"Good,but need to improve room,the shower room door lock broken and limited socket at bed area."
"+ Location, room size, staff, not far from the beach, many restaurants within walking distance 
- cleanliness, no cupboard, no table, dated structure"
"for us everything was fine in this hotel but the towels were gray and very old. In addition, for some reason there was no hand soap, in principle, we had a good rest there"
Good hotel for vacation
"Staff was friendly and warm welcome, breakfast​ was terrible, ac is hot move to another​ room cause ac issue new room was old and have a mold with bad smell and toilet cant flush"
"I liked the balcony, your in the heart of things and it was a very professional check in experience. Great sense of privacy even though I had a great balcony. Huge room. Lovely big bathroom."
"Staffs are very friendly, good location convenient for you basics, they clean your room everyday so it's very comfy to get rest  from a whole day tour."
Nice pool. Clean and comfortable
good place and good staff
Friendly and helpful staff. Excellent location 2 minutes walk from Poppies 2. Easy 10 minute walk to beach. Will stay again.
Sayangnya sarapan nya masih alacarte
I got the ground floor patio unit which made my trip. However if you got the level 2-3 rooms. It will be a hike up after your already tired day trip to your room. This hotel is also not recognised in grab which is a down side as you would need to always call or text the rider/driver directions. Overall if you get the ground floor then this hotel is great.
Maybe one day can repeat again here
hotel was nice but the facilities is poor...there is hanger in the room but no place to hang the clothes with the hanger so i don't know why they put them on the room.
"Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. The rooms are in a terrible state The bathroom stinks, paint peeling off the walls, staff unresponsive and terrible  attitude, sheets and bed linen smells towels grubby.broken furniture and side tables.Stains everywhereTv not operational with advertised channels Internet very  slow balcony door rattled due to frame detached from the  wall
Only redeeming feature is the location"
"Nearby Kuta beach, easy to access to any attraction places."
gak worth it banget
The street is full of bars and pubs with free entry
good
Good
Lied to
"-Location was good in the heart of Kuta, 
-The bathroom smelt like a mans toilet, stale urine. 
-The place needs a make over! Looks very different to the pictures shown on the page when looking for a place to stay."
