"Do not deceive with the stars when it comes to grandmas plus. They proved the mis conception of 3 stars hotel is wrong. Their staff is 5 stars service. They are honest and hardworking. 
They ensure the room are kept cleaned even for my 6 nights of stay. 
Cafe Dua sisi staffs always professional. Ensure the food ordered correctly and served beautifully. 
The staff at the lobby always alert and friendly. 
Just tell them what you need and they try their best to assit.
I ask for a tiny screw driver. Even not available, they try to find way to help me.
I told them the mosquito issues. They even Whatsapps me the next morning to check on me when I was too sleepy that night. 
(Which I also thought to contact them as well) 
They took the pro active steps. They are beyond my expectations. 
The rooms are comfortable and bed is for a heavy gal like me. 
Not a 3 stars… their service and sincerity is beyond any five stars hotel. Felt their warmth …
Will be better if there is a slope to allow the baggage to roll up from the drop off point to the lobby."
"Stay only for 1 night at this hotel, very satisfied with the service, room and facilities. And I got best price from Agoda only 110k rupiah. The receiption staff very warm and friendly. I came to the Hotel at 01 PM and the check-in time is 03 PM.  But the staff to give me the romm at 02 PM so I didn't need to wait more long time. The room very neat and clean, from the bedsheet, toilet, shower room. They provide 2 bottled water as compliment. They also have safe deposit box so I can store my laptop and valuable items when I went outside to enjoy Bali. I did not choose room with breakfast, but for additional breakfast is very cheap with price 35k++ rupiah with set menu main course, choice coffee or tea, choice of fruit juice, slices of fresh fruit, toast and jam. When check out time have conversation with hotel Manager Mr. Joko, He very warm and nice, He help to take my luggage to my rented car at the parking area. My wife tried the De Nyuh spa, she very enjoy the spa time, the spa price is also affodable. The Hotel also have small swimming pool, but I haven't try the pool due to my activity mostly outside the hotel. Keep the good work and service Grandmas Plus  Seminyak..2 thumbs up 👍👍"
"I stayed at GrandMas for like 5 days and it's been a great place to stay. The staffs are just so friendly and helpful (they always do their best to met my requests, and always greet me everytime while giving a warm smile, isn't that great?), the food are tasty, it's near to the beach, near to Mexicola (lol) and altough the room isn't that big, it still spacious, comfortable, clean and just GREAT for me. Oh, and the front desk staffs, they are like standby for like 24 hours. You can also rent a motorbike via the hotel, and they also provided with some activities that you might enjoy. It's also near a minimart and Circle K, also the ATM (like BCA or Commonwealth if i'm not mistakenly remember). I would love to come again in the future and I will definitely recommend this place to all the people that I know for sure. Thank you for the great service GrandMas Hotel, I wishing for the best!"
"Location: It is just a walking diatance to seminyak beach. Seriously 1 min distance. 
Parking: just right in front of the hotel , bigger parking lot is also provided not far from the hotel.
Bed: we booked 2 twin beds. It is comfortable, pilllows are thick not my preference. It hurt my neck so I brought mine in. 
Bathroom: small, but it has everything yiu need. Shower head kind of clogged, please consider to clean it to remove the dirt that stuck in the shower head.
Bedroom: small, but its just perfect for us. We brought spray, it is helpful enough to spray the rooom manually. 
Minus:
Close to smoking area. I saw some towels were out on the floor bloking the door so the smoke didnt gt into the room. I did the same.
I suggest smokers can only smoke at the loby? Well, they still smoke near the lift.
50% I will come back to this hotel due to the smoke."
"This is 2nd time we've stayed here and extended our stay by 5 days right now. Excellent value, very clean, beds comfy, sheets super white and clean, and staff so friendly and helpful with everything, great food and love the live music till 11pm each night"
"I had a very great experienced staying at Grandmas Seminyak Hotel for 7D6N. I would love to share my personal experienced, there was an incident where my room had a little problem with the Air conditioned. After i had made a report about it, they really took a fast action to solve the problem. They had replace me to the another room. Then, they even send me a special gift (mini teddy bear) with apologize card. The manager (I guess) also very friendly and so sweet. She had offer me for a free drinks & a plate of snacks as for their appologize about the incident. As for that, of coz their appology accepted. I’m really impressed with the services and I would like to give a huge congratulations to all the staff! Surely I will come again & stay here if i come back to Bali. I love you Grandmas Seminyak Hotel! Well done! 😘"
The staff are very welcoming and the service is like a 5-star hotel without the high price. My AC had issues and they went over and above to make sure I was comfortable and happy during repairs. All the staff and assistant manager were outstanding. The location is near the beach and shops as well. I plan to stay here again in the future!
"We had a great stay at Grandmas. The staff were soo friendly and kind - the names I managed to catch were Sara, Leni,  Era but every person we interacted with was so lovely. The room turn downs were great. The restaurant attached was brill - we had breakfast every day (included with stay), lunch 2 or 3 times and dinner twice. As well as cocktails. Just brilliant. Music every night was awesome too. Location of hotel was great, v short walk to beach or a shop for supplies and also some other restaurants. Amazing!"
"Grandmas Plus Hotel is very clean, looks new and tidy in and out!  It is located at strategic location surrounding by restaurants and Mini Mart! The drinks are cheap there in the Mini Mart, walk few more stops, there are some cheaper massage along the road, besides there are so much restaurants, bars and desert ice cream shops there too! ❤️ Guess what, we could walk to the beach just about 3 minutes, 300 meters distance! It is so convenient! The hotel is valuable, and the staff are very helpful and friendly! Specially thanks to Davi and Juni for the hotel and also some other staff I forgot to ask their names, they all are very polite and given the high rated services to us! 🎀✨ We will definitely return to this hotel or to their branches around Bali, and wish they could remain this high spirit of outstanding service! 😍👍🏻"
"Staff was amazing especially Era, Juni,  Djoko ,Sanjaya  and the room was clean stay was wonderful, breakfast was perfect."
"Everything about this hotel just perfect, location, cleaness, and staff. Even thought we just facing the pandemic, but they are deliver every aspect just what we need."
"I find this hotel very valuable for your money. I love how friendly towards the guests.  The room is quite small but very clean. Location is very strategic bc it’s close  to the beach, beautiful and stunning view. They also have german books, Yuna is very helpful thanks to her i can manage my travel this time. The only thing i didnt like was the motorbike rental, because it could have been so much better. But overall i enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would def come back soon!"
"It was very nice. The stuff was always very friendly and helpful, the room was small, clean, everyday they made the bed, water on the room. I was very satisfied as a solo female traveler! :)"
"This is not my first time to stay at Grandmas, whether the one close to the airport or in Seminyak, and I always know what to expect. Great hospitality from the staff, especially Ibu Ani, along with the other staff like Rista, Era, Juni, Putra, Arta Sara and Yuna. 
For what its worth, the place is very comfy. With welcome drink, tea and coffee in the room. and extra water if you want. The great thing with this place is that even though it's a budget place, but it has hair dryer.  My lady said, it's awesome!!! 
It's very close to the Seminyak Beach, just 5 mins walk, you can either run or jog in the morning, or enjoy sunset at the beach. Clubs and Restaurants are also around, it gets packed during the weekend. 
They also have their own restaurant, so if you don't want to be bother to go around, they have range of great food with affordable price.
For me, it's 10 out of 10 for a budget hotel.
Will come here again and will always become one of my favorite budget hotels. Very recommended!!!"
"It’s amazing hotel with amazing staff specially sara she give check out early and help me to safe money full night instead 
Actually I’ve booked 3 nights but I extended to 6 nights due I feel too comfortable with clean hotel and very brilliant costumer service from all staff especially sara"
"The room was tiny but in some sense it’s fit for all your belongings as they have hidden storage to keep all ur stuff even ur big luggage! Don’t ask for the facility as they have everything we need! And you can always go for walk to main streets. If you have young children don’t forget to put in the note reservation, req for the quiet room as the live music play every night until 11pm. They moved us to the quiet room after our 2nd nights and sent us little cutie bunny for our child as their apology. Very appreciate that! Beside that, everything was super great!!! Thank you!!!"
"The staff were extremely friendly, offered us ear plugs as their restaurant played live music till 11pm (didn’t bother us anyway as we were out), room was clean, generally quiet area, short 5-10min walk to food places
We paid 87k for a breakfast set, was not bad but not spectacular. Overall 10/10 stay!"
"If you’re on a budget but want a location close to the beach that’s clean and comfortable with a 5 star staff then this is your place!  I’ve been staying here for many years and it just keeps getting better!
Spa is wonderful too!  Thank you!!"
"Great location so close to the beach! Good surf spot for beginners, close to money changer, message and some cafes and restaurants. The staff were amazing very friendly, breakfast was basic but only 35k. The lunch highly recommended. Ani was wonderful I had an issue with noise outside when they were cleaning and I was teaching online, they moved my room and even gave me a complimentary lunch. Great value for money ! Shower wasn’t so strong and not much hot water but otherwise highly recommended !"
The staff was over the top friendly and helpful and we felt very welcome. They arranged everything for us at any time. But in general from the cleaning stuff to reception everyone was super kind. Also the location is nice only few meters to the beach and far enough from the clubs but still reachable :)
"Very very nice hotel. So clean. Rooms are small but very comfortable. And unique design. Manager Ibu Ani and other staff are very welcoming and helpful. Feels like you are spesial guest. And price are really affordable. There are swimming pool also and nice beach just 200 meters from there. TV has many channels even some russian channels. Bed sheets are new, so nice to sleep there. Just if you need a silent room ask them to give you room far from the street. Cos i got room very close to the street and there was sound from motorbikes but still it's not really bother me. Thank you) for sure will stay there again."
"Having fun with my soccer team during stay, relaxing on the pool while listening to live band, 3 min walking distance to d beach and lovely staff , what a wonderful vacation."
"The staff was amazingly helpful and always smiling at you. Anything I needed they were right there with. The rooms were small as expected, but storage was thoughtful, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. A/c works great, hot water and a working TV & fridge. Can’t beat the location. I would stay again for sure!"
"Grandmas Seminyak was the best experience I had in Bali. Not only they deliver on what’s promised, but exceed expectations! Customer service is to a T and they treat their guests like family! I stayed in the hotel long-term for almost a month in June and could not fault it with anything.
I needed more pillows, blanket, you ask they provide. 
In addition to all that, they also provide a forum to engage clients in all sorts of activities and I had the pleasure of participating in a few of them!
Ani conducted a 121 workshop on how to make the traditional balinese offerings from scratch! 
Sentana was patient enough with me to show me how to weave a farmers hat, now that’s a challenge! 
And for the final workshop with Leni and Deby we did the traditional bracelets! They were kind enough to let me not only make one for myself, but also two additional ones for my family that were coming to Bali the next day! 
Big shout out to Ani for making my Grandmas experience an absolute success! 
Goes without saying the hotel Spa is indeed the best one in Seminyak, and I have tried loads! If you go to the spa, ask for Alit, she’s got the hands of an angel! 
Will be definitely staying again when i come back to Bali! Close to the beach and restaurants and bars, and very strategically located! Before i left in July, they started  having live music every night in their restaurant, what a delight!  
Thank you the Grandmas team!! You’ll be missed!"
5 mins Walking to Samayek beach.  Nice and clean and very friendly price❤️
"Great people = great place = great time!!
Comfortable clean and affordable place.. staff always ready to help with big smile and pure good heart!!"
"Fantastic hotel, spotless room and bathroom, linens, AC, hot water, a wonderful restaurant and a truly great staff and security out front who will help with scooter parking. Walk to the beach or rent scooters nearby. Seminyak is a busy place (June 2022) with lots of traffic (and tourism isn’t even back fully) but a fun and aocial beach scene. The hotel bar is limited - only local arak liquor for drinks.  But there are fridges in the rooms and plenty of local bars and restaurants. Enjoy!"
"Awesome 4 nights stay in this facility. Room size is comfortable for 2 pax, clean, & chic decor. More importantly very strategically located and just 300m from beach. Staffs (Yuna) very friendly & hospitable. Very affordable. Highly recommended to those planning to be in Seminyak."
"The location is great and walking distance to the Seminyak beach.  Close to  many shops selling souvenirs, clothing and plenty of good restaurants.  We like this hotel because the staff is super friendly and all out to help you with any questions.  We will come back to stay in this hotel if we return to Bali again."
"Good  hotel well located , walking distance to the beach and cool sunset spot  good value for money and very welcoming staff . I recommend 💯!"
"If I can give more than 5 stars I would !

Best of , specially Mrs Ani , Ms Yuna , Rista , Era and all of them , they gave me a bday surprise that I never imagine 😂😂 , thank you so much c matur suksmee  , this place is one of  hotel in Seminyak"
"Good hotel at good price.  Restaurant attached to hotel, very reasonable.   Staff very friendly, took care of any small problems very quickly.
Short walk to beach.  Everything very neat and clean throughout the hotel."
"For a day or two, it's a nice affordable place to stay. Although I preferred their Legian property. But the hotel restaurant is pretty good with live music and the rooms were clean and tidy."
"When I told front desk staff for 1 night extend,  they also asked me, if i have any trouble at my room? I told the water pressure is low, they sent technician quickly… and text me the next day for ask already fixed? I told, not yet. They sent technician again, and the next morning they give me a cute doll for apology… how sweet ❤️"
"Just a great konsept.
5 Star hotel for 3 star price.
I will go there agaln"
"Ideal location , very friendly and helpful staff , spas , local shopping , beach and cafés at walkable distance . Nice place to stay 👍"
"Stayed for last one night in Bali, we choosed Grand Mas Seminyak. As we always stayed at another Grand Mas properties. Very well recommended to be honest. Check in process by staffs were so fast and not complicated. Terrace and the pool, lobby area and restaurant were amazingly maintained and green. Staffs also helpful, from the receptionist, waiter and waiters, as well as the room attendant, security and public area. Even this was a budget hotel, we really appreciated and would love to come back for the next time for sure. REALLY RECOMMENDED.  LOVE THIS HOTEL!"
"For the price, Grandmas Hotel offers great rooms with everything we need, excellent service, and good location near Seminyak Beach! There are also a number of mini marts nearby, so it’s convenient. We would stay here again! The only thing to note is that it’s some way from the busy stretch of roads in Seminyak where all the cafes and shops are located, but we had a car and didn’t mind the short drive."
"Located about 250m from the Seminyak beach, this is a great stay. Comfy room, friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast and great location. Highly recommended!"
"Good location with walking distance to the beach. Room is clean, counter staff is friendly and helpful. Something to note is that this is an eco friendly hotel that uses solar panels for water heating. We have to shower in cold water after the maintenance staff told us that solar panels unable to generate enough power to heat up water tank due to rainy days during our stay."
"This is a great option for staying in Seminyak, a lovely clean hotel with cosy rooms and very friendly staff. Perfect location for walking to the beach and restaurants :)"
In the prime location of Seminyak. Walkable distance from the cool Seminyak beach. Very economical rooms. Comfortable stay. Very helpful staff. Attached restaurant is awesome. Worth your money
Affordable accomodation with great service. Room and towel very clean. Location very strategic and near to the beach. Great cafe with live music
"I liked life music . Very close to beach .  Staff is helpful. I feel comfortable, safe and relaxed there. 
A little renovation around the pool would be good . 
 Bed was comfortable."

It is very good for holiday. Near beach and also has a good restaurant. Every night they have singer to present many English songs. The cleaning staff clear room everyday. Totally is wonderfull
"A nice stay either you want to go for a stay cation or travel. Staffs are really nice and helpful in my period of stay. Access is easy to everywhere, close to pretty much every famous beaches, beach clubs and nice cafes. They also provide a rental service for bike in the hotel so you dont have to go through the trouble looking for rental service in your area. But if u need a car, unfortunately you have to go and search for yourself."
"The staff is super friendly. They will help you with smile. The room is clean and you got a nice view from 3rd floor. Very recommended if you are looking for nice, clean and budget hotel. This hotel is the best!"

Very friendly and helpful staff. Prompt service and very courteous people. One of the staff (named Lina) tied a sacred thread also for good luck.
"This hotel’s service is really goooood👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 The room is very clean, hotel’s staff very nice and friendly (also very helpful)  location near seminyak and double six beach. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family:)"

"The most satisfying of this hotel is the friendly staff. Really appreciate their kindess and their help with my baggage. I also really love the restaurant. They provide various menu of tasty food with reasonable price (cheapest among other hotel in this area). The staf are friendly as well. Thank you grandmas for making my holiday fun and enjoyable. 
I'd be happy to come back some other day."
"Would definitely stay here again! The rooms are cozy, clean and the A/C blows cold. Everything we needed during our stay. Staff is superb."
"Pros:
Great value - I paid $15 per night
Location - 3 mins walk to beach.
Amongst lots of shopping and eating options.
Small, but well appointed modern rooms.
Ultra nice bed linen and softer comfort bed.
Optional breakfast had good price and variety.
All staff so friendly and helpful.
Cons:
the pool is really only a plunge pool for < 4 people. Its not a lounge around the pool situation."
It is close to beach just 5 min walking. Location is really good to all necessary places. Rooms are good and clean. You can rent motorbike at the hote only
"The staff are very helpful and warm. Is at a strategic location and they have spa in the hotel at reasonable price. Breakfast is super duper yummy! Although there are a few small black ants(i think 3 night stays i saw only 10-12 in total) in the room (on the table beside the bed and in the toilet), everything is super great!"
"Great pool? you got it. Friendly staffs? you got it. Beaches? Sushi? Bar? Night-club? CVS? Sunset? right, you got those too! amazing, amazing location quite but not too far from nightlife area. oh and Great, great super Spa!"
"We stayed for 5 days! The staff were nice, room are clean, facilities ok for budget hotel. And the location near beach, just took 3-5 minutes walking"
"With less than 200k IDR/night, I was able to get pampered by the hotel. The wifi was strong, the AC was powerful, the bed was great, I had a table for my work. There was just a little issue with the hot water in the shower, other than that, it’s great"
"I will give 6 or even 10 stars if I could. The hotel services are impeccable. The staff will acknowledge each and everyone, no matter how many times you pass by them. I'm really amazed. All the staff here are very professional and take pride in their jobs. I’m so happy. Thank you so much."

"i had a wonderful stay here in grandmas hotel, clean room, plenty of natural light in room, friendly staff, perfect location only few minute walk from seminyak beach, definitely will stay here again when coming to bali"
"Gotta give the 5 star to front office team, a man that assist me during the check in is super friendly (apologies for not remembering his name) but all the front office team I met is super nice, well done ! Thank you Ni Luh Putu Muliani and the team for such a good service."
The room including the bathroom is not big but compact. Just perfect for all the duties. Clean and comfort.  Breakfast is good.  Staffs are friendly.
I found the hotel deserving of its high rating.  It is true it is not the quietest hotel at night but this is due to its popularity being a  bustling hub of activity that did not stop me from getting a good night of sleep.
"It was fine for me as a solo traveler, but would be tight for two. The two twin beds take up 95% of the room. the bathroom is small as well. But the room is very clean and well maintained, and the staff efficient and helpful. Very good for the price."
"Had nice time staying here. The room was clean, friendly staffs, the location and budget was spot on. 
Sure will stay here again next time I visit seminyak area."
"The location, service, staff and the eatery place next to it (dua sisi), everything is amazing. Era was very friendly"
I stayed here for 3 nights and the property is amazing in all respects. Wish there was a small cupboard in the room...besides that the property was too good to be true
"Really great value for the money. Just a quick 2 min walk to the beach and there are a handful of restaurants on this Main Street. 
Rooms are a little tight but we were using it just to sleep so no big deal. Breakfast was good, nothing special. The restaurant does do live music at night but depending on where you’re staying you can’t really hear it. Didn’t bother us. 
Would highly recommend to the budget solo or couple travelers! 
Peace out grandma!"
"Value for Money was great. Staff very friendly. Rooms , yes small-ish, but Can not beat Loacation so close to beach, shops and Restaurants. No noise in my room, they offer free ear plugs though LOL
Clean Bed/Bath. Would come again if I am on a budget."
I stayed here for my 21st birthday with my friends- the facilities were great and the staff were so friendly. The best part I would say is the location; such a good choice and GREAT value for money
I extended my stay twice. The staff is amazing. A great budget-friendly hotel with a connected restaurant and spa.
"Staff were so welcoming & friendly, location fantastic really close to bars & restaurants & very short walk to the beach. Room was bigger than i expected & was very clean. Pool area also very nice & clean. Only fault would be the shower wasnt great & could do with a new shower head"
"I stay here for two weeks, and it was nice. The room, staff, food, and location were perfect.
5 minutes walk to Seminyak beach I can see the sunset every evening. I would stay here again."
"Grandmas is nice for solo traveler. Bedroom is comfy with good facilities. But if you share room is not ok cos bedroom is not large.
Staff is friendly. Location is great  just 3 minutes walk by my short leg. Lol
The minus are pool is small and there's no big mirror at room."
"The staff very helpful, the room also very clean, strong wifi, location also very good, highly recommended"
"All is in excellent condition,will be back again next time"
"Staycation with my Lil family was amazing, love with the room so comfortable, friendly staff and good cleanlines"
"Good location, 3 minutes to the beach. Nice cozy place for non fussy travelers as the rooms are tiny but sufficient for sleep - get up and go. Has good spa but was fully booked n has good restaurant with live music."
The hotel was in a good location.. walking distance to the beach.The pool was tiny and the restaurant had a very gud vibe and food was delicious.. must try dish nasi ayam betutu. staff very friendly. Only con is the room is very tiny for 2 person. very little arm space ( one feels very restricted)and no ventilation.
"All the staff are very nice, they greet us nicely. The room is clean and bathroom was very clean too"
"A pleasant stay, always, at Grandmas. Room is clean and nice. Location is perfect, very  close  to the beach."
"The room was clean, cozy even the room was quite small, but it was good enough for us"
"Enjoyed 9 days here, very close to beach, friendly staff, many stores, options nearby.  Room was pleasant to hangout in."
"Everything is great! Good service, very clean and comfortable!"
"The staff was awesome, really!! The rooms are a bit small and none have balconies. They're very clean though. Nice restaurant and bar with live music every night."
"Staff here was helpful and friendly.. 
The room was clean.. complete facilities in the room such hairdryer, mini bar,  kettle..
All just beyond my expectations.."

The facilities good and the staff is perfect especially front are so helpful and friendly. Give two thumbs up for Era and Rista 👍🏻👍🏻
Staff is very friendly and good. Place is very nice and near to Seminyak beach.
"The biggest positive for this hotel is its prime location in the Seminyak area near to the beach. The rooms and bathrooms are clean albeit a bit on the smaller size. The staff is professional and the restaurant is also of good quality with live music during the evenings. Overall, a great budget stay."
It's a very good hotel with a pool and restaurant to go along with it. Good and helpful staff. We were only there for a day so couldn't view the surrounding areas but nonetheless the hotel was overall great
I'll miss the staff here. The room's always kept clean and they provide personalised service
"I've stayed in this hotel many times and Grandmas Plus Seminyak always delivers exceptional service, great cleanliness as well as great guest service. especially the service and hospitality which delivered by Bu Ani and her team never cease to make me feel at home, Bali's hospitality at its finest for sure. all in all, great stay and worth the money."
"Nice hotel with nice staff and good location!
Mr. Djoko and all staff are very friendly and helpful.
Thank you Grandmas Plus Hotel Seminyak 💕"
"For solo traveler, I would suggest to stay in Grandmas seminyak, location wise it's close to seminyak, petitenget area and near to double six beach. Price was superb affodable and staff were polite and great service."
"Simple, friendly, good food, nightly live music, good location. Top value for those on a tight budget and yet has all the facilities !"
Friendly staff and very helpful...room are so clean and cozy...i ll Be back to stay there soon;)i hope
"Have always stayed here pre-Covid as the location is great, room is cosy (basic but functional) and the live band at the restaurant is nice. Glad to see that it is back in action! Only gripe is that the furnishing is a little worn out and not as well maintained. Would love to see these fixed. Will be back!"
"Honestly from outside its not really nice.  They building need painting /maintenance.  Surprise me inside the room super duper clean.  With the price I paid absolutly excelent.  Pak Joko is nice, he really try his best to make guest stay comfortable.  The staff also very friendly and full of smile.  The spa is good. Thankyou."
Small and cozy room without any windows. Very clean and nice bathroom with hot water. Welcoming and very nice staff at the reception and restaurant. Small swimming pool to relax and enjoy your self. Good budget hotel to stay in this area.
Reasonable price and excellent service. Kudos to Sara and Ani for helping me thru my checkout.
"Near beach , the staff helpfull, and the GM very helfull and kind , good hotel, we would come again to stay at Grand mas seminyak, thank you"
This hotel is amazing and located a short walk from Double Six beach. The food is amazing. The breakfast is so good! Walking distance to a yoga studio. At night there is a live singer in the restaurant. Staff is amazing and quick to respond. I extended my stay.
Always stay at this property and always satisfied. The staffs are great. Very helpful and always smile. Keep up the good work Guys :)
Clean and friendly staff. E
