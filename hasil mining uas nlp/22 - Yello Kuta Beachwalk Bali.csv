"I have to start with the tour company this hotel partners up with. If you stay here this is a absolute must!!! MR GADING and his Son work right outside this hotel n after being ripped off by one of the other drivers, these guys showed me bali from a different view. Honest, respectful, spoke english and never worried about time. they care about the experience. contact him 0812 391 8575. 
The hotel is simple and clean, incorporated into the mall is great. the mall has everything you need. a 5 min walk and you are at the beach. you can wonder around and have everything you need close by. The staff were super friendly with everything and most are still practicing their english so they try to make conversation with you. i thought that was great. rooms are clean, ac is cold, funky decor but overall a great bang for the buck."
"Its the best hotel you can get around kuta beach. It is a very very new hotel.
Value for money.
Its in the mall itself. 
It will be great if there is a mini fridge as the weather is quite humid there.
About 3mins away fron the beach.
Staff are very helpful and friendly.
Free PS5 for you to play while waiting at the lobby.
Simply The Best!!!"
"I have so many good things to say about this hotel! Firstly, checking in was a breeze and staff were extraordinarily chirp and friendly. We stayed at the deluxe room and it was larger than I had in mind from seeing the online pictures. It had everything you need, really. They made good use of every inch of space. For the price we paid and its prime location, I don't feel like you can get a better deal. The buffet breakfast offered more variety than we were expecting. There's a free-to-play PS5 in the lobby and we had fun playing some video games, and there's also a foosball table. What's more, the staff does this dance routine at breakfast which we found entertaining to watch as they seem to be thoroughly embarrassed, but having fun. It brightened up our day. The only thing I would nitpick about is the parking, since they share parking lot with Beachwalk Mall. Parking especially for motorcycle is difficult and cramped, and we had to go all the way round. However, the hotel stamps your parking ticket and the parking's free. There is no swimming pool at the hotel, but the beach is a short walk away. Another thing is, they play loud retro video game music at breakfast which we found to be a questionable choice. With all this in mind, we would still come back to stay here again when we are in the area."
The hotel is literally inside the mall but not noisy and minutes away from the beach. Very clean facilities and great staff. See you again!
"The location is well placed and convenient. The room is super comfy and clean.  You can shop around and find delicious food nearby since its located in a mall. If you need to buy dairy or drinking water, there's market under the mall. Overall, it is very recommended and bang for your buck for its convenience."
"The location is inside the mall easy to.find food and everything you need 
The room is clean and smell fresh lime.only the problem of water flow from the sink and no electricity near the electric kettle. Over all the hotel is great. I hope they can fix it soon."
"so comfortable due to its location, near to kuta beach and beachwalk with lots of restaurants and stores to shop."
"The location is superb,  it's right in front of the beach! And it's also connected to the mall so it's easy to buy snacks or drinking water because there's a supermarket in the basement.  The room was also very clean and new. Note that there's no refrigerator. I didn't need one so it wasn't a problem. And if you want to use hairdyer you have to call the room service first. Otherwise everything else was great. Will def stay here again. Oh, and there's a PS5 at the lobby too! It's free to use."
"Hi , salam dari malaysia . Hotel ini memang best dari semua aspek especially friendly staff and room yang sangat cantik . all the food also yummy . tq all staff Yello Hotel till meet u again 🥰"
"Cheap rates, clean room, awesome staff!"
"Best biliknya, cantik.. baru.. wangi.. plus walking distant je dgn shopping street.. attach dgn shopping mall beachwalk.. sebelah je hotel aloft.. will come again.."
Good location as the hotel is connected to the shopping center. Breakfast spread is good even for vegetarians. Downside will be the room is small and sound proofing not so good for the corridor.
"The location is great and it’s very very clean. The staff are super friendly and extremely helpful. If you want a fridge in your room, be sure to book a Deluxe Room as the Yello Room doesn’t have one. If you like a pool, there is none, but you’re happy without a pool, this place is perfect."
"I was booked for 3 nights. The location is very strategic, very close to beachwalk mall where we can get every stuff & food easily . Kuta beach is also a walking distance. The staff was also friendly & helpful.  The breakfast was also good."
"Hassle-free, affordable hotel located beside Kuta Beachwalk Mall, 400m away from Kuta beach. Friendly staff and clean rooms. Took the rooms without breakfast as we don’t usually eat in the morning. On our last day, we decided to have breakfast at the hotel. The choices were limited but definitely enough to my liking! The soto soup and porridge were the best!!! Will definitely stay here again the next time I’m in Kuta!"
"Best budget friendly place to stay at Kuta, well maintained, friendly staff, beautiful view, and best location for shopping and its inside beachwalk mall, enjoyed our stay..!"
"We are traveller with 3 kids, so we booked family room with interconnection door. But after we stayed, then decided to stay longer time cos the cleanliness of the room and ease access to Beachwalk mall. Highly recommended to stay on this property"
Comes with family elwith 2 teen kids. Ordered family package of connecting doors. Enjoy the space and still feels like all together altho 2 rooms. The only downside is the rooms dont have small fridge.
"Nice place to stay, near right to shopping mall. Near to kuta beach u may go and walk. The slack part was thw aircond were little bit warm. Overall nice place👍"
We were staying there for half a day cuz of our flight. It was a pleasant stay. I would stay again if i have gotta visit Kuta.
"It's a practical hotel, strategically located next to Beach Walk Mall.  Neat and clean facility, good service too.  We have been stayed there twice, in March 2022 and late April 2022 during the Ramadhan.  They provide choice of sahur menu including the takjil.  The room service menus is average 50k, with the good taste, it's cheaper than having the meal in the neighboring Mall"
"Very good to stay with family , very Clean room , a humble Staff , good taste for breakfast , near beach kuta"
"Best hotel in Kuta area, great staff members, clean and safe. Highly recommended."
"Location in Beachwalk Mall, staff very friendly. Everything is superb."
"with modern design & easy access to shops and f&b, nice room but the aircond blow directly to the bed."
"Locare inside the mall. So my wife really enjoy staying here, neither my wallet"
Great location. Connected to the mall. Beach Access. Easy for manual wheelchair user.
"Love this hotel , connected to the mall and will be so popular as time goes by"
"Location is just behind beachwalk mall ( just need to walk through the mall ) but is bad point too cause u need to walk about 5 mins to the beach . Room clean and cozy , aircorn was super power . Food was fine but no complain just very typical Indonesian food . Need to walk abit for good massage like 15 mins away ."
"Overall the hotel and rooms are clean and well maintained.  Breakfast menu is standard, with fried rice as main dish with some options such as porridge, bread and toast.  It's strategically located in mall complex so find halal food is easy.  We stayed there for 3 nights and happy to comeback"
"This hotel has great location, great cleanliness, good facilities n the staff very helpfull."
Staff is helpful and friendly. Easy to access the Kuta Beachwalk Mall. Value for money.
"Great location, new hotel , staff are awesome friendly price"
"First time stay in Yello Kuta Beachwalk Hotel, where Kuta Beachwalk Mal is just step ahead. Staff was friendly. Breakfast is good. Can’t wait to stay again in this hotel for next visit."
"Good location, staff, room, and near mall"
"Room is clean and the crews are friendly. However, there is no hot water on the water dispenser so take note."
"If you are travel with kids n want to go to the mall you can stay in this place. They got family room perfect for kids. 
Since they don't have a pool, you can play with your kids to the beach in front of the hotel. 
They got PS5 at the lobby so ya can play.
Overall this place is simply, modern, clean. Love it !"
Staff sangat ramah & hotelnya nyaman + bersih
If you want to do some shopping & have a good time in Kuta..the Yello Hotel is the answer..adjacent with Beachwalk shopping mall & walking distance from Kuta Beach
"Kamar bersih, breakfast dgn harga segitu worth it bgt, pelayanan staff yg ramah"
value for money and great location
Pelayanan baik
"3 stars hotel but 5 star location n rooms. Newest budget hotel in Kuta Bali which located inside Beachwalk 2 mall. You can walk directly to the mall, n very close to Kuta Beach too in front of the mall. Shops are very close n reachable by foot. Very clean n deluxe room look so spacious too (although it's not that spacious in real size). Breakfast is standard but taste is good. Definitely will back next time. thank u Yello Hotel"
"Tha staff here were very nice, very dependable"
"Hotel attached to shopping, superb bedroom , great food, friendly staff and location in the heart of kuta"
"We choose this hotel not only because its location but also white background and attractive design, simple but also colorful. I got sunrise view window+garden view, we love it. :D
Ofcourse beside all the goodness there is also some minor things such as thinwall (not soundproof), hot water is limited (need to wait for small water heater to heat the water).
I'm hoping hotels could lower the price."
Best location in town
Best and affordable hotel near kuta beach
Too convenient! Just above the best mall in Kuta! must stay!
Good location and it is  aunique and beautiful hotel
"Best location, very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent value in Bali."
"overall wonderful.... friendly staff, very clean, young at heart, and ease of access from and to everywhere, availability of a refrigerator in the room will be much appreciated."
I've to several hotels located in a mall or plaza. Yello is definitely one of my favorite.
"Room is so nice and strategic. Also staff very nice, and super clean room. Just they don't provide small fridge and hairdryer unfortunately. but so far so good..."
"Excellent location situated inside Kuta Beachwalk, believe it would be excellent for young families. Close to Kuta beach which is just through the shopping mall and across the road. Staff were super friendly and helpful with my weird requests. Hairdryers need to be ordered from Housekeeping and need to be returned within a few hours."
"Room is tidy, breakfast is good. Also pretty cheap for its location"
"Good service, nice hotel great location"
Very recomended to stay here with children 👍
"Staffs are friendly. Location is awesome.  Downside is hair dryer needs to be ‘rented’ and might not have availability sometimes. On second day, we have also found a cockroach in one of the room’s toilet. Another room found a centipede in theirs too. However the staff acted fast to remove them and sprayed the repellent."
"Good location, clean and fast response. I will be back again."
Good place to stay at kuta. Near beach and mall. It has modern style. There is playstation 5 to play at lobby.
"Great location, confort room, great staff"
"Good spot and location ,."
Amazing place to stay in Bali in front of the beach and very close with the mall. I love it!
"Booked for 2 nights and decided to extend 1 night. New hotel, the room is very clean and bright. But no hairdryer and refrigerator."
Everthig is fine
"New Hotel, very clean and excellent location situated inside the mall, no pool, no refrigerator, no hair dryer, so bring your own 😀 Very friendly staff 👍"
Walk distance to Mall Kuta Beachwalk and to Kuta Beach
"With member’s rates, this is the to go to budget hotel to stay if you were planning to spend most of your time outside the hotel.
Would definitely come back again."
"Great location with no facilities, but you got a big ocean for just a minute walk"
Everything is perfect. Just need to bring your own personal amenities.
Good location and value for money
Really friendly staff!
"Near kuta beach, mall, resto"
"Located in Beachwalk Mall in front of Kuta Beach, i can easily reach the beach by crossing and grab some food in the mall.
However i was distrubed by the noise from the hallway , i think the room is not soundproof,  i can also hear the sound from the other room.
But everything was great, i would love to stay in this hotel on my next visit."
"The good things is the location is right in the mall and the hotel is clean, 
The bad side is no facility and if the mall close you have to walk around the mall cos the hotel located behind the mall… and the mall security so strict even it’s rainy they well not allow you pass trough to the mall… and the hotel flour not a ceramic even they clean your room it’s still felt like dust in there… no shower cap gals, and hair dryer only for 2 hours/days"
Locate in the department store  which comfortable to shop
"Nice hotel, clean room, vary tv channel, nice area (closed to Kuta beach walk Mall), easy to find local meals... 
The room quite spacy for a couple..."
"It's a good place but the amenities are limited, i would suggest NOT getting the breakfast because it's disappointing (trust me) but the location is great and it's clean. Definitely would recommend to those searching for a budget place in a good location."
"If you love Kuta beach and a mall person with limited budget, this is the best hotel for you to stay."
Everything was sparkling clean! Unfortunately the aircond was really hooooot! & it was leaking throughout the night..
"So close to the Mall, like it !!"
"Everytime we travel to Denpasar, we always take a chance to stay in this hotel for couple of days."
Great staff and very handy location
Back in India (Kolkata Holday Inn Express). Even you watch few events from your room. Though can't hear sound. 😜
"so far so good to whom seek hotel with best location in Kuta area, so close to the Kuta beach, and also in mall area."
"We stayed 1 night at yello and we’re happy with this hotel. We chose connecting room and it’s quite spacious for us. The room is clean, and i love with the cleanliness of their bedsheets. Although it’s budget hotel but it’s comfortable for us.
We will recommend this hotel definitely."
"No refrigerator in the room !!! Must have, specially in bali"
"The location is pretty strategic with max secure, value for money, new properties, good hospitality, need improvement in room cleanliness"
Good location good price and easy to go anywhere
"Room is clean, staff friendly, the hotel is above the shopping mall makes everything easier to find a meal for the little one
very very affordable price, only one thing i dont like...the hotel is at the back, had to walk approximately more less 500 m to the beach."
"We just stayed for one night in family room (2 room with connecting door). The hotel is located in the Beachwalk shopping complex. It is very convenient. 
The room is very clean (because newly open), not to big but spacious enough for 4 people. The amenities are pretty basic, you have to ask if you need. 
However, the room is not sound proof, the noise from the door can be heard clearly. I believe because there is a gap between the floor and the door horizontally and vertically."
Recommend 👍👍
Highly recommended for solo travellers
Should be your base hotel in Bali .
"Pros Clean, Modern and friendly staff. Good concept - all things has yellow
Cons need to borrow hairdryer. Small room compare to others in the area."
The hotel is located inside a mall so it's convenient for shopping. I wish there is a pool though.
Connected to beach walk mall
"Room is clean but having no fridge is a bit odd to me, facilities not having a pool or gym sucks for this price-point but it is a fantastic location being a few steps from the best mall in Bali."
Don’t confuse yourself with tons of other hotels. This location should be your base in Bali. Excellent location. Clean hotel. Walking distance to many attractions.
Felt comfortable there very secure
Very good and very strategic place to stay
Location in the big shoping mall and in front of kuta beach
"The only downside is the TV. For God’s sake, use other provider other than nom*den! My TV won’t turn off! And everytime it turns on, the super annoying yello video comes on!"
"Location is at Kuta Centre above the mall. Hotel is budget facility and small room that is reflected in its price. Hotel is quite new, but there is already sign of tear ie. our sink has a large crack. The rest of interior is quite new"
"Hotel is attached to Kuta Beachwalk Mall and very convenient if you are into shopping. The Beach is just across the Mall. 
Well positioned and value for money. Extremely recommended if you are looking for simple fare hotel."
Enjoyed our stay. Small rooms but definitely fits the purpose and needs.
"A suit accomodation for those who cant live without mall vibes. Many f&b choices, beach accross the street, friendly n helpfull staff"
Good Service
"Located near to Oasis Gate at Beachwalk Mall. Super convenient place if you don't mind the rooms a bit small and lack of facilities - but since it was just for night's rest, it should be ok. Do note that hairdryers are not available in each room - you will have to call front desk and they will promptly loan you a piece for 2 hrs (and you have to return) - so it was a bit troublesome. Aircon in room also didn't work very well but called the repairman and they came promptly to fix it. Other than that, good location and I'll consider to stay again."
Boutique room with location near shopping
"not too expensive, not cheap either"
Hotel location was good but room size was too small according to the money
"It's a brand new hotel, colorfull, funky, young teen ambience, room is compact... we traveling with 2 teens and got room with connecting door
The room doesnt have fridge, so we cant keep our drink cold, this hotel is located in the far back of the mall.. although this is a beachfront mall, but it is actually quite far to walk to the beach..but it is still ok
Staff are great, and friendly, internet is fast, airport is like 30minutes away, please expect Bali trafficjam, as this mall is located in a one way street in a busy area, so trafficjam can be a pain if you take car in Bali
The famous Kuta beach is just across this mall, this is one of the best beach in Bali, the beach is very flat and wide, with big wave for beginners surfer and safe for small children
Our room is facing to the central stage in the mall, it can be a bit loud during live music, but the mall close at 10pm.. and most of the time we came back to hotel late evening, so not so much a problem
One thing they need to improve is the TV !!!
The are using internet TV provider with teribble service, it often freeze, required restart so many times, it has disney+, youtube but it can never be played.. it keeps loading and loading and gives you frustation and ruin the day.. I hope they can replace this provider and improve it
But overall, it is a good stay, good hotel, good staff, recommended for budget traveller"
"Easy to find a restaurant, next to the beach, inside the shopping mall"
You cannot go to garden area unless you're room is in the 1st floor. No heldesk phone. Washroom quite small. Great location
"Overall the place is nice, but it's a bit difficult to find the hotel especially if u come by motorcycle.  The staffs are helpful, the facilities are nice."
"Location very strategic, just one step ahead to beachwalk mall. Room looks new and modern, a bit small escpecially for family trip. Breakfast need to improve"
"For the price , i think room should be bigger and  provide more facility. Need new towel. Bed is to hard, ac making wistling sound, i can hear people closing door and talk from corridor and next door room . This hotel dont have chiller, no hairdryer. Location is super"
"This is a good transit hotel with clean rooms, but no pool. Next door to shopping mall and eateries which is a plus."
