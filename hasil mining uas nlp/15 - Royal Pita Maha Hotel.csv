"My fiance and I stayed 2 days here as an engagement gift to ourselves. It was perfect. Utter privacy and an wonderful room and pool area overlooking the Ubud jungle ravine. We felt totally spoiled with all those extras like fluffly bathrobes, a fresh fruit bowl and all the room service would could ask for. Would recommend for couples wanting a private getaway."
"I absolutely love this place. The hotel staff were so welcoming. Upon arrival we were given welcome drinks at the beautiful restaurant overlooking the valley. The view from the room was fantastic, overlooking a the river and we even caught a glimpse of the waterfall after rain. Room was clean and housekeeping even checked with us in the evening if we needed anything else. I could not recommend this place enough!! ❤️❤️❤️"
"Very good place to relax despite the number of steps u have to walk, u will be very fit by the end of your stay, very clean, not a sound to be heard except nature, it was a beautiful stay"
"One stop luxury vacation. Every details count in your room. You can enjoy luxury villas with big private pool, jacuzzi, spa quality amenities, natural sound and hill view. The resort also have own natural spring pool, rainforest, river, lagoon, spa, and waterfall. That was amazing when you feel a luxurious resort in the middle of ubud hill forest. All food was very good, restaurant with rare view (must try: thousand candle dinner..!!). This hotel owned by royal family of ubud kingdom, so no wonder we can feel all ubud culture everywhere and they serve you like a royal families member :). Note: For best view, you can ask villa number 140-150"
"The bed in the room is comfortable, the staff are wonderful and the facilities are good. I really like this hotel, I think I will visit again"
The resort is breathtaking. The rooms are very nice and well maintained. The staff are all very friendly and welcoming. We did have an issue with the refrigerator which was fixed immediately once we mentioned it. The buffet breakfast is phenomenal. Very happy with our stay here.
Absolutley amazing stay at royal pita maha the hotel grounds are to die for could not recommend enough you would pay 4x the price at any other place
"close to nature, very Calm, huge property, excellent privacy, friendly staff. Very nice experience overall, wanna go there again, want to spend more time around the river. keep one entire day to explore in & around the property as its huge and beautiful."
"You’ll get peacefull place to rest.
Staff were great. All was so helpfull.
Food were so so, but they always try to give you the best.
Best thing is you stay surrounded by nature, including bugs and mosquito, with the sound of the river, and that makes me want to go back to this place again.
Perfect 👍"
I am stay at with my wife its best resort here very best royal villa like a heaven peaceful place and very biggest resort and all well maintained i love it
"It was a beautiful stay and unbelievably amazing view from royal pool villa, very private."
Villa with the best view over Ayung river in Ubud. Excellent sunset spot whilst having a dip and sip
"Exceptional grounds full of beautiful architecture, history, art, and nature. It’s incredible the efforts that were put to preserve the nature of the grounds and embed a hotel so harmoniously.  A waterfall on the hotel grounds, a holy spring , the Ayung River right there on your walks of the grounds. You get so much more than what you pay for!"
What a beautiful unique hotel to stay in. This place is mesmerizing and one to be remembered for sure.
Best resort ever i really like it very amazing pool villa i really enjoy with my gf very biggest size i spend best time here i like it
This place is perfect as a super natural yet luxurious hide away from the typical busy Bali tourist area. Love it!
The Royal Pita Maha was my favorite villa I ever visited before the covid-19 hit. I stayed for 4D3N. The price was lower than in normal non-pandemic situation. I understood that the villa must adjust some services because of the covid-19 but I think lowering food quality was not an option since I was hoping that I could use in-dining room service to keep me stay in the villa all days avoiding the crowd. I hope the best in this situation and hope everything will be back to normal asap. Good luck and many thanks!
"We absolutely loved our stay at Royal Pita Maha Hotel.
Staff were friendly, from reception to room service to breakfast.
Our villa was overlooking the forest, we couldn’t fault any during our stay here.
Thank you for the room decoration for my husband’s birthday.
We look forward for our stay here again!"
"Down the hill you can go untill Ayung river bank. Nice spot. They also have small waterfall  with pools decorated naturally. Healing and refreshing indeed.
One thing to consider, meal are quite bland, anyway you can order gofood"
"We love the authenticity of this 15 year old resort with the attention to details in the architecture, fit out and how it is incorporated into nature."
"Perfect service, great food! Employees are  polite and helpful. Besides, it’s the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed that, it’s such a palace. I really want To Go Back :)"
Most impressed with the caring and friendly staffs. The stay is exceptional and totally worth my money and time!
"The villa was really affordable  and came with a shuttle to downtown ubud!  The private pool is also pretty deep.  I’m 5’6 and it goes up to my neck. 
It also a nice location if you want to be close to the monkey forest and the rice fields.  The only downside is you need to insert your room key in this slot for the electricity to work, so I couldn’t charge my power bank while I was out."
This resort was extremely beautiful and unique. The view from the pool is stunning and the facilities are one-of-a-kind. The yoga in the morning is fantastic.
Superb location with each villa looking over either the jungle or river (for villas located near Ayung River) depending on the type you book. Cleanliness can be improved as the pillows/ bedsheets smelled a little mouldy (probably due to the location of the resort and Covid-19).  The facilities were a little rundown and could use some touch-up but overall the fantastic location and service quality by the staff made up for it.
"I love everything at Royal Pita Maha.
The place feels like in heaven and escape from your stressful society!
Also great place for have a wedding reception with spectacular view from the hotel.
Strongly recommend to stay here."
"Jungle ""after"" your curtain. Felt the heart of Ubud - the view from your bed, material and room detail also hotel location - highest you can get at Ubud."
Every little detail here is exceptional
Wifi is a bit slow in our room but everything else is perfect
"this place is very beautiful, with friendly staff service.  we spent our honeymoon in this place very comfortably. Don't forget to try the spa."
"if you wanna avoid crowd and enjoy peace and serenity, you've cone to the right place"
"Property is amazing, rooms are big with big pools & breathtaking views. However the breakfast is very ordinary like 3 star hotel and amenities in the room are pretty ordinary. TVs are very old. These negatives are not big enough to skip this hotel. 
location- If you want to stay inside the property then it is very good else it is 15-20 mins away from ubud center."
The still look great although some part feels old and need to get renew especially the wooden parts. The restaurant provides generous portion of breakfast and the quality was not bad at all.
"hopefully, all the facilities will be operational so that we could enjoy the fantastic experience"
"Our villa is quite spacious. A quiet and  secluded unit but the stairs.is very steep and slipery during rainiy season. Nevertheless the facilities is superb, if not during pandemic, it would be awesome with the spa facilities near Ayung river."
Totally amazing
"The resort gives you a different experience with activities and views.
It has an original balinese ambiance but you have to be ready to be accompanied with lizards which is common in the island.
The breakfast was very basic
The food in general was alright"
"Lovely Hotel with spectacular views and large terrain to explore.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Quiet location.
Will visit again!"
Really enjoy the hotel and the view
"This place is the best option if you are traveling as a couple. Best private villa with pool, quiet and nice staffs. The villas are in the woods, so you might have to bear with some bugs, lizards. The breakfasts did not have many menus, but overall, we did not regret staying at this place."
Amazing room and view
"Hi, The Royal Pita Maha was excellent, I really love the set up for me. Even though the resort a bit down to the hill, if anyone planning to stay in resort I’d recommend this resort or best place for honeymoon couples. They provides all kind of service, floating breakfast in your own pool Villa, honeymoon candlelight dinner, SPA, honeymoon set up. The breakfast location & view marvellous.  Overall I enjoyed my stay in pita Maha."
we loved it
"It was such a memorable stay , will never forget. 
But a lot of renovation and updating needed , it lacks maintenance. It's such a big property and needs strength to explore but worth the efforts. 
My sincere request to the management to please take care of such a beautiful property. 
Flush in the bathroom was very problematic,  and got water with low setting burnt me very much that lasted for 6 days."
"Totally recommend the property and services by Agoda!
The property Villas are huge and spacious and the staff at the property pampers like you a King! Amazing view and surrounding areas with private pool in the Villa itself."
The hotel had a very good view however it was kind of run down. There was a urine smell in the toilet and the staff were not as helpful and friendly as the other bali hotels staff
"Excellent view from any spots, green & peaceful ambience inside and outside. A lot more to discover!"
"Great view of nature, huge insects..."
"Good resort, very traditional type, however it could be quite dark and creepy to some people outside the room  in the evening :) You could find a very nice pool alongside Ayung river and can have a relaxed and quiet day all day long."
The water warmer not working properly. Room cleaning service was late. However the royal spa room was huge and the spa was excellent.
"Recommended for those who loves nature and aren’t afraid of creepy crawlies and late night loud frog/cricket sound as it’s value for money based on the size and private pool. Loads of nature friends so better close off all doors and windows at night if you wanna sleep soundly and itch free.
Staff were all friendly and professional but unfortunately their support ends at 11pm daily (yes, no in room supper nor receptionist if you need anything).
We were told that for the private pool villa, there’s a limit of 200lites hot water before it will run out and you will need to wait 45mins for it to refill. However, initially we were successful in filling up the super huge bath tub w hot water and left for dinner (that took around 2 hours), however when we came back around 10:30pm, there wasn’t any hot water and we had to shower w cold water (and it was raining heavily).
Went to check out the holy pool and lagoon and gosh it’s unswimmable as it’s filled w water insects swimming around. Only the main pool looks more legit. There wasn’t any staff around to support even though they mentioned there will be people around till 6pm daily.
Breakfast wasn’t that great too as we found ants scrolling around the syrup sauces, though there was a pleasant surprise for the chef to cook us eggs Benedict even though it wasn’t in the menu.
Overall it was a good first time experience for me and my gf to live close to Mother Nature thanks mainly to the stunning morning pool view we got."
"Many animals inside Vila so i cant sleep will ..! 
Design Vila it is Very beautiful and the atmosphere of nature lives you
Breakfast 7/10 
For me I can't come again 
** last day after call manger give new vila actually it is beautiful"
wifi need to be improved
"Not highly recommended for 2 big reasons. First of all, there are too many bugs in the room. When I first checked-in and introduced to my first villa, it was full of ants. Ants are just crawling everywhere, and I was so frustrated that bugs are crawling on bed and my stuffs. At last, the hotel seems to privately located and very hard to use gojeck or grab food services. 
If you are not that sensitive about bugs and location, this hotel might be okay. But if you dont, reconsider your option. Cause those reasons almost about to ruin my honeymoon."
"To whom who really love nature life maybe this resort is good choice.
Not value for money (overpriced) if compare with what you can get during you stay in hotel
Need more maintenance, furniture need to be change to new (too oldie)
Not much things you can get except the good view from ur big window room.
The light too dark"
"The hotel is full of bugs even inside the villa, the bedsheets weren't clean and full of bugs,
Breakfast options very limited and not so tasty!"
We could not sleep as night as there was creatures in our room! When we complained they just looked  at us shocked.
"This is one of the best hotel villas that we've ever stayed at. The price is a splurge for my husband and I. We booked at another hotel for 5 nights in Ubud, then came over for the last 3 nights of our stay. Very worthwhile and memorable. 
Unfortunately my husband arrived sick during our check in. The hotel staff didn't hesitate and handled the situation with great attention. We had a Doctor from the clinic make a house call and they checked us in early. The doctors services were very good and he got better within 2 days. The staff called to check on him, sent up porridge, and asked after him in a very genuine way.
Lovely large rooms and views too die for.
Will stay here again next time we are in Bali. Also, for friends with the budget would not hesitate to recommend it.
Many thanks Royal Pita Maha!"
"we stayed at the royal pita maha for one week and it was a most relaxing stay.  the pool villa was beautiful.  it was immaculately clean, the outlook was breathtaking and the bed was absolutely huge and extremely comfortable.  the grounds of the royal pita maha are spectacular - the gardens, lagoon and healing pools as well as the many spots to stop and have a drink or just take in your surrounds. breakfast was fantastic and they honestly have the best danish pastries ever!  the staff were so professional and welcoming and we were always greeted with a smile.  they did everything possible to make you feel at home and were happy to have a chat!  we cannot say enough about how wonderful our stay was and highly recommend the royal pita maha!"
"The best place I’ve ever stayed in. Best hospitality. Our Royal Pool Villa was bigger than expected. It‘s very open. It’s beautiful. It’s tranquil, both the resort and villa. The view overlooking the valley was breathtaking. The pool was huge. Breakfast was decently good and the view from breakfast area was overwhelming. The entire place is very cooling in the morning, approx 18°C and gets a little hotter in the afternoon but remains at about 25°C which is still cooler than other parts of Bali. The little gifts from the resort was a beautiful added touch to our experience at Royal Pita Maha. Everything about this resort is just amazing and I‘d never switch accommodations whenever I go to Bali again. This place has left my partner and I in awe. 
Do note that this place requires a lot of stair walking. From the lobby to the villas, to the riverside, to the yoga bale, to the main pool, lagoon pool, and holy pool, and many areas of the resort."
"although the villa that we stayed in could use a very minor facelift, this was more than made up by the incredible view and grounds. the staff was also very helpful and happy to chat with us when we were waiting for transport or transfers. additionally although we only ate breakfast there, our dining experience was wonderful with good food attentive service and again wonderful views. i highly recommend this hotel and on behalf of my fiance and i we would like to thank the staff of royal pita maha for a wonderful experience in ubud. we look forward to visiting again in the near future."
"We're lucky to live in the top level villa with new equipments, the swimming pool is big, private and with a great valley view. The decor is very traditional baliness style and we just love it! Walking around the valley is quite relax and feel like in the forest. One of your great experience is to have breakfast at the organic restaurant side by Ayung river, you can even see the rafting people, so excited! All in all, Royal Pita Maha is the most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in Bali, definitely will come back again."
"The best Hotel you could ever imagine.
Location is in the forest.
We have stayed at this hotel for the Past 4-years & it never fails to disappoint.
Returning this year after touring Europe the Royal Pita Maha was the place to whind down & relax before going back to Sydney.
The Healing Villas are huge & private. The pool is your own & filled with clear cool water.
The view over the grounds from the top pavilion where breakfast is served is spectacular.
The staff are attentive & service the villa daily, & respect your privacy.
My wife has made me promise to take her there every year for 7-days for the rest of her life.
We will continue to go every year.
Need I say more?"
"This is a truly beautiful hotel with breathtaking views. It’s really what dreams are made of. The staff were lovely and the service amazing. 
What I would perhaps advise guests is to check if there is a wedding booked during your stay at the hotel, as there was this wedding party one night with terrible music and people screaming, it was like staying next to a uni club during a school disco night... I will definitely stay at Royal Pita Maha again but I will make sure there is no wedding party booked the week I’m going if possible.
Thank you for an overall great experience!"
Words and pictures cannot describe how breathtaking Royal Pita Maha is. It is worth every penny to experience the resort for even just one night. We had a private villa with pool and it was pure opulence. Every view was magnificent! Must try the food at the Organic House. Every where you look there is beauty. Royal Pita Maha is an enchantimanal place telling a beautiful story with every detail you see.
"i have no word to discribe the experience!Royal pita maha's flamboyant, luxurious, exotic, spiritual touch makes everything so perfect! It is one of a kind. It holds up the bar of its peer resorts!It offers affordable luxury！ Great thanks to Royal Pita Maha! The breakfast should be buffet,seriously! And the staff are not happy! Manager,please, treat them better!"
"This was our second time at The royal pita maha, the first time was amazing and the second time didn't let us down. The staff is always friendly and accommodating, and the resort itself is breath taking. The one thing that was disappointing was that they didnt seem to realize we were there for the second time nor did they let us have a late checkout even though we requested it early in the morning. Aside from that the stay was very nice."
"The Royal Pita Maha is an amazing hotel, in a beautiful valley.  We enjoyed our week there and the food, staff and spa were fantastic. 
We did have to move mid-way through our holiday due to building work at the spa, thankfully the hotel found us a new villa that was even better than our first."
"The Royal Pita Maha is a beautiful property in an excellent location. We had a pool villa with a great private pool and gorgeous views of the river, valley, and surrounding jungle. The staff was excellent and the food was good. We are very satisfied and recommend the hotel."
"My wife and I stayed in Royal Pita Maha for 3 nights.  The hotel is just located in a valley and is like a natural garden.  Ayung river pass by the hotel.  There is a restaurant side by Ayung river.  You can enjoy breakfast there by listening to natural voices and breathing nice.  The villas are hanging on the hill and face down to the valley.  The private pool is a real swimming pool with the size of 20m2.  The villa is built at traditional Balinese style, so the equipments are old.   if you look for a modern resort, it may not perfect one.  If you chase natural and peaceful things, it's right here."
"a great place to retreat and relax. view of the valley was indeed breathtaking, something that is not available at other hotels along the kedewatan / sayan area. we stayed at the pool vila that is higher than the restaurant and lobby, so we have full privacy during our stay. there were people white water rafting along the river front of the royal pita maha, so their noise may disturb villas closer to the river. luckily that wasn't the case for us. breakfast was ok. this hotel is a must stay if you're visiting this area."
"What a Place!
We had visited the Hotel for Lunch last year whilst in Ubud & said that we would stay this year.
After the main stream of Seminyak we were in heavan. 
The privacy & appointment of the Villa was second to none. We had a huge private pool & a fantastic sunken bath. The outdoor garden shower was an amazing feature that we used over & over. My wife & I did not want to leave the Villa.
The staff & managment were friendly & every request was met promply & with a smile.
The resort is focused on privacy & water.
Swimming in our own private fresh-water pool was an experiance never to be forgotten. The natural springs that feed into the pools & the sounding sounds of the river winding its way around our villa were like a dream. We felt as if we were in a scene from a Tarzan movie. 
I can not say a negative point about anything to do
with this resort. 
We are looking to returning again next year!
If you want privacy, ambiance & a romantic setting look no further than the Royal Pitta Maha.  Loved it!"
"Royal Pita Maha is a gem of a find.  The location and setting cannot be beat, with all rooms overlooking the steep hillside and into the valley.  The private infinity pool perched on the steep hill gave us a completely unblocked view and made us feel like royalty.  The organic restaurant by the river was also special - food was good and the sound of the river rushing past made it so much more relaxing.  While the rooms are indeed on the expensive side, we were definitely not disappointed with what we got.  We are already planning our next trip back. =)"
"Myself and my husband stayed at the Royal Pita Maha for 3 nights recently . Our daughters wedding was held there which was organised by Botanical weddings. 
We could not fault anything , it was a magical occasion and a beautiful hotel to stay in when visiting Ubud."
"Royal Pita Maha met all our expectations. The villas are luxurious, the grounds lovely, the views breathtaking and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. On top of that the service from the spa made the whole package memorable."
The Royal Pita Maha is superb with their amazing decors and location in the valley surrounded by the jungle. We enjoyed the pool and the villa facilities. We like the balinese style. The staff were attentive and welcoming.
"Went to Royal Mita Maha for a honeymoon. Greeted by staff upon arrival and they provided assistance for check-in and baggage transfer to room almost instantly. Staff was very prompt in any queries made, and assisted with the arrangements for our itinerary and transport requirements. Definitely a great location to consider for couples deciding to reside in the Ubud area."
good
"Everything is perfect, worth every penny, we got the room with the best view, thank you so much,,, beautiful landscape and environment, excellent service, would love to come back for a longer stay… amazing  experience at Royal Pita Maha❤️❤️❤️"
"The resort is one of the most old place in the vicinity. Very famous and luxe. The hotel is a bit out of tech though, for example internet was so slow and cut/off seems it has modem issue.   Some area of the villa needs improvement such as windows, ceiling or faucets. If windows were can be closed properly if will save a lot of energy as well as preventing the insects coming inside the villa. Apart from above, our infinite pool villa, and scene were amazing and so unique. All in all was a acceptable experience. Aah, one more thing the cost of hotel services such as service charge or the cost of food and beverages were toooo high."
"Even only for one night this is a must,  The pool villa is the best.  Best view in Bali"
the villa places in the forest. We can sleep with birds humming and sound of river. That's great experience for us.
One of my favourite places in Bali. Love this place.
Opted for a villa for my honeymoon and it couldnt have been better. Feels like living in heaven and the angel staff treating you like gods.
Too good to stay here
Excellent
1st time staying at such a location with awesome ambience. Till today can't forget the experience of being in the pool and just looking over the awesome view.
Awesome location and hotel. Recommended
very good
Good
"We absolutely loved staying here for our honeymoon. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel special, and the entire hotel property was absolutely beautiful. We felt very relaxed upon leaving - a perfect stay."
nice and beautiful hotel.. i will come again
This stunning property is quality built with gorgeous villas. The staff are wonderful. We had a wonderful time
"I have been once before some time ago and wanted to come again, and it didn't disappoint. Staff are super friendly, food is very good. The Spa is fantastic and would recommend booking. The set up is so well done and relaxing. Its a place to relax and do very little if that's what you want or venture out if you wish also. A morning plunge in your own private pool is a must and what a way to start the day. I'm going back again and wish I had stayed longer"
Amazing hotel
"Best location and view is amazing, but food is okay, rest is all good"
"The best moment in Bali, experience its calmness. Wake up in the morning and find yourself in the most grateful state of being alive. Awaken by birds' chirping and stunning views."
Big
Yes
nmice
Food was crap too.
"The resort is surrounded by such beautiful nature. The staff are super accommodating. Every day they exceeded our expectations. 
The villa was simply perfect with an amazing infinity pool (villa 118). 
I was afraid given the surroundings that I would most certainly encounter mosquitos but this was no problem at all. 
It was a daily exercise for us to walk from villa to lobby.. so many steps but certainly would keep you fit! Would love to return."
"Excellent option for adventurous travelers seeking Royal luxury. Stayed at the Royal Pool Villa which I highly recommend, exactly as pictured with stunning views towards the jungle! Resort is planted in the vegetation which comes with bugs, geckos and other wonderful creatures. If adverse to insects, you may wanna stay away from Ubud. The resorts gardening, surrounding landscape, room architecture with heavy marbles and the common pool options are on another level. Truly unique experience. Minor negative is the food which is nothing special, but breakfast is rich."
Wonderful!
"Great  resort  ,  spacious villas  with generous infinity pool and breathtaking views  ! I have stayed in Bali in several resorts in the same price range but these one is  by far the best , the resort itself is a great experience"
"View is fantastic. You can see one side of whole jungle from riverside to the top of mountain. Buffet has not much various but very delicious. Especially egg chef’s omelet was the best. I asked to put some chili and salt. Since it is in the middle of jungle, there are many bugs. However, It is worth to stay there."
Peaceful and quiet; it was an excellent stay
Loved our Balinese villa and pool and enjoyed the communal pools. Didn’t try the spa but looked lovely . Restaurants slightly disappointing. All staff were wonderful and hellful
"The first villa [jacuzzi Villa]  that we have stayed was very spacious. the only drawback was it was far away from the Lobby and one should track up and down which takes at least 5 to 10 minutes walk. If you have knee problem please avoid this place. On the first day we found a toad in the room. Subsequently, on the second day we found a cobra entering drainage system of our villa. We contacted the Manager and we were  given a different room with a stunning view."
Book a healing villa and enjoy the paradise..
There were mouses everywhere . Not recommended at all
"Awesome view at the room, nothing but panoramic views of the forrest with private inifinte pool.
Great staff. Good room service food. Only 20minutes to Ubud center with free shuttle service.
Only down side - abit far from some tourist spots, 2 hours drive to Jimbaran for dinner"
"Great view, nice location and stuff"
Great place loved the pool villa better than the healing villa to be honest. the restaurant next to the river is the best. great french toast. the spa services are amazing worth the price!! Everyone friendly and it was easy to get to town.
Like most hotels in Bali the service was superb. Staff is always very attentive and friendly. The villas have just amazing views. As all the villas are with private pool you get the privacy you are looking for. Take the time to explore the grounds as there are many scenic places for pictures. Few examples is the Holy Pool and the cafe by the river.
"Perfect for relaxation in a natural environment , staff extremely friendly and helpful to customers and kids !!"
"The hotel is filled with the nature and every time we walked inside the hotel premises, we felt like we are in the forest with good aroma of trees and flowers.
As the hotel site is very huge, you can enjoy just walking inside the hotel seeing waterfalls and rivers with greenery.
The villa is something like you can feel the Bali traditional style and also luxurious and spacious with dedicated infinity pool and bathtub.
The Staff are very friendly and assist anything that you would need there.
Probably this is one of the best hotels in Ubud and will definitely come back here.
Highly recommended!!"
Great place to Destress
"This is a great place for holiday. A nice view with spring for enjoying. It is a peaceful place with very professional massage service. A must try when you are going to Ubud!! Highly recommended!! 
Just one thing, too many insects (ants and mosquitos). Good breakfast, but not recommend to order food in the hotel, you can have much better choice in Ubud center not far."
In july 2018 we stayed for 2 nites at Royal Pool villa. Excellent views and facilities but hilly and no buggies. You have to walk in sometimes slippery steps and pathways.  Not recommended for unfit or elder folks.
