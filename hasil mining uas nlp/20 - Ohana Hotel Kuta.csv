"The room was really clean, the aircon is really good and fresh. I decided to just put my legs and lean my body in the bed, instead of going out."
"Very value for money at less than SGD30/night with breakfast. Only stayed one night. The room and overall hotel was clean, it’s relatively new. Breakfast was ala cart, I had nasi goreng with fried egg, it was so so. Location was at the heart of Kuta. Plenty of food options nearby. 10-15 mins distance to the airport."
"Ohana Kuta is excellent for Honeymooners, where is comfortable wide rooms with all required facilitation needs. Friendly staff all day. 10-15 min. Walk from the beach, I strongly recommend it for a real relaxation💚"
staff is very friendly and helpful. everyday they will clean our room and change everything. the room is super comfy especially the bed haha. there’s no view but that’s not a problem. the important thing is it’s comfortable for me to stay there. there’s a mart in front and a nasi goreng stall beside the hotel.
"Everything was perfect. Good location, nice staff, we stayed for 2 nights and they cleaned up the room while we are out."
I absolutely love Ohana great location beautiful friendly staff 😊 a hidden gem I stay every time in Bali aircon works perfect nice showers with good water pressure and comfy clean rooms great value for money
The best hotel I've stay in Kuta area. Everything is walking distance. Easy to find halal foods. I will definately come back  in future if I come to Bali.
Breakfast was alright. Staff is friendly and helpful. Room got upgraded to deluxe upon arrival but it's all good. Price is cheap for 2 rooms and 5d4n stay. Worth it!
"Stayed here for 3 nights really amazed by how good the facilities were in this hotel and it is located conveniently to Kuta night life and beach which is 5 min bike ride and 11 min walk,  great staff swimming pool clean rooms will definitely come back when am in this area"
This hotel is in a great location not too far from the beach. It's a little tired and the breakfast now compared to pre COVID is pretty rubbish however when you look at value for money and location the hotel is excellent. I've stayed here many times just because I've stayed in many other hotels around Kuta and Sanor and on price and value the other hotels cannot compete.

The hotel location make it perfect to explore Kuta and Bali. The staff very friendly and helpfull. The hotel always clean.

"Everything was good and superb 
Located in centre of Kuta. 
Only the wifi very slow and bad. But overall is good, very recommended 😍"
"Really nice hotel with everything you’d want and need for your stay. 
Only negative was we booked a double months in advance and when we checked in they only had two single bed rooms available. We were upgraded but disappointed with us booking in advance. 
Staff were lovely around the hotel and the rooms are really nice. Loved how close it was to markets and main Kuta (only stayed here one night before travelling on)
We would stay again."

Limited option from hotel menu... You don't have choice
All great with a good price✌️
"Staff all so helpful and lovely 
Clean great location

Staffs are accommodating. You dont need to remind them to clean your room. And the place is accessible.
"Good place, good service, super clean"
The room is nice... The staf is good... Very patient with customer... Its only if they can do something about the smoking smell from outside coming to inside our room...
"Good location,alot of food places and minimard.
But maybe the management must be provide good park area(its to small).

"It's a very good hotel, close to Kuta Beach. Very nice staff, has swimming pool, rooms are spacious and comfortable. Deserve to stay there."
"I really liked this hotel. Good staff, Cleaning every day, decent hotel restaurant and a small but nice poolside. The only minus would be the wifi, it was not good at all, wifi went off and on all the time, other than that. I'm happy with the stay in ""Ohana hotel kuta"""
Worth the money
It’s a good hotel with a very strategic location. I love walking around the hotel because there are lots of place to hangout and it’s not that far from Kita beach. I also loved the facilities in this hotel. Good place to stay overall
loved the location amongest the local area. good size room and nice little hotel
"Except for the Shower everything was great, Great staff, great location."
"One of the cleanest hotels we have stayed at in a while in Bali.
Staff were warm and welcoming.
Only down side was the breakfast, it became boring after 3 days of same option but for the low cost charged, can’t complain.
Very close to airport if needing a room for an early flight. Very few options close by if wanting to eat out somewhere different."
Good job guys!
"Service was great, breakfast not much choices. They offer eggs but won’t give it to you unless you ask. Swimming pool located in the middle of the hotel, only way to go back room,  which is bit lack of privacy."
Centrally located. Everrything very close.
VERY GOOD !
Room a bit tiny and the breakfast is so so only. Indeed its worth the price
"Spent 5 nights, right in the heart of Kuta. Loved the people, a little bit far from the beach(700m) but surrounded by GREAT food stalls and right in the middle of all the shopping streets so even walking to the beach was actually fun"
"Hotel is relatively new and in good conditions.
Although we requested for large bed and the hotel management acknowledged and confirmed 3 weeks prior check-in, but when we arrived it wasn't available and had to stay in a room with two twin bed.
Breakfast is also very limited to eggs, toasted bread and potatoes as far western food is concerned and few asian dishes.
There was no sausage, bacon or even ham available.
Nevertheless it is a good option for people traveling on a low budget."
Nothing to complain with its price
Nice staff. They give me free room upgrade
"It's a very good hotel, close to Kuta Beach. Very nice staff, has swimming pool, rooms are spacious and comfortable. Deserve to stay there."

"This hotel has comfiest linen, you might wake up late because its softiness, one thing that missing probably just the price but considerating its 4 star hotel so its ok, recommended guyss"
"everything was good.
only internet did not work almost half of day"
"Hotelnya nyaman, kebersihannya ok, dekat dengan minimarket. AC aman dinginnnn."
best Location..
Super clean and helpful friendly staff
"I spent 2 nights at Ohana Hotel with Extra Bed. The location is quite good but not too close to Kuta Beach, it’s require 10-15 minutes walk to Kuta Beach. 
The room is quite big to accomodate extra bed. With the price I got through Agoda, it’s really affordable."
Overall great. Only downside was the azan (morning muslim prayer call) which woke us. Otherwise great stay!
"Very nice staff, clean hotel, good location and close to Kuta Beach."
I wish if you look after the AC condition. It is normal. And the breakfast is very less and limited. I will come back soon. Thanks a lot...
"Facilities are top notch , kuta beach is 14 minutes walk and 5 minutes by bike, wifi is excellent pool is good, cleaning service is great. Amenities are modern rooms are spacious."
Fantastic pool on a hot day.
"I travel with children and choose family room. The room is big, quite clean. The location is also strategic.. I just dont recommen the breakfast, maybe they can make the dish better than this."
Professional Staff
"It's a nice clean reliable place 
In the midst of chaotic kuta"
"+ Good location, many food stores around, a few minute walking to Kuta Center and beach.
+ Well-equiped room and well-trained staff
+ Nice view through window
- On the other hand, breakfast is limited of choices."
Breakfast should buffet don't alacarte
"Need to complete the toiletries, also slippers will be good"
This hotel is comfy yet clean. But litte bit issue with the bathroom. Very helpful staff
"The home was cozy and clean, reccomended place to stay if you're in Kuta"
"Value for money, clean, lots of shops around...limited parking at front
Very small lift
Staff friendly but don't expect an early morning wake up call. We requested for 5:30am wake up call but no joy, lucky our alarm saved our flight :)"
"Stayed for two nights. Bed was comfy and the shower was hot and powerful. Although small, the rooms were clean. 
The only let down was the breakfast. We ate  elsewhere."
"I got a real bargain deal and thought, I could use a few days close to the seaside. The hotel was clean, room and bed were ok (though only seeing a wall when looking out of the window) and staff was friendly. But the area was very underwhelming. My room was on the ground floor, just a few steps away from the swimming pool and the restaurant. From 6 in the morning on it was constantly noisy. And at 4:45am an Imam, probably from a nearby mosque, called to prayer and woke me up. Only when I slept with earplugs I was able to sleep. That being said, Kuta is definitely not my favourite place on Bali and even though it's only a 10 minutes walk to the beach and I found some nice places with decent Wifi and great food, I wouldn't come here again."
Breakfast only have two choices iso buffee
Hotel Ohanna was a very good stay for me and my family. We enjoyed everything and the service and staff are really courteous. However just one improvement can be made during the breakfast instead of personal service they should have buffet as the staff at the restaurant is limited and can’t manage.
"*Cleaning could have been better for a three star , Lots if stains on the bathroom and moulds , not that a visitor would be happy... If that's what they could afford I would better go to a better hotel for a better price 
*Food was fine but options could have been still more
*Pool was in the middle of the Hotel(No privacy) making it a showcase for almost all of the rooms"
"Spacious room and bathroom,  very clean,  and traditional food stalls are in walking distance"
Location far from beach. Only 1 family room on each level. We had to stay on different level cos we book 2 family rooms. Cleanliness needs to improve. Choice of breakfast are very limited. No buffet breakfast.
Didn’t keep the promise said will upgrade my room but didn’t do it
We all enjoyed well. Only during the breakfast they should make it buffet style as the servers can’t manage personal service.
"Pros
-The staff were kind and were willing to help.
-The room was clean and so the other facilities.
Cons
-Coffee would have been better... (powder instant coffee was just not what I had expect..).. other foods were fine. 
-The motorcycle we rented through the hotel had really old back tire and we got a flat tire almost right away... (we had paid to rent it for one day, had plans and all that, but...) Had to get help from a random nearby hotel to call someone to fix it. The owner had us take care of it ourselves and the day was just ruined. I'm not saying the hotel was fully responsible, but since we rented it from there having trust about the quality, not even considering other options, I feel like they should also make sure that the motorcycles are safe and well maintained. We could have easily got into an accident.. (It was the back tire and so we didn't notice it earlier.. the front one, we took pictures and all that, and it was new..)"
"Close to airport and Kuta beach.
Recommended for budget travellers"
Walking distance at the next traffic light.
They promised upgrade my room but didn’t do it
"The room is so small. No sign of ka'bah. We were asking for take away breakfast n they only gave 2 water for 3 of us, no juice at all. Only bread with egg not even butter..."
Halal food not eounght
"THE HOTEL PROVIDED A SMALL PORTION OF POOR BREAKFAST, TOTALLY CAN'T EAT ENOUGH, IF YOU NEED ADD ON BREAKFAST YOU NEED PAID EXTRA.  SERVICE SUPER POOR.  IF GIVEN US POOR BREAKFAST LIKE THIS, I THINK BETTER NO NEED GIVE BREAKFAST TO CUSTOMER."
"This place was a perfect if one is looking for quieter location.  We were poolside, so there was noise traffic, when people were coming and going with their suitcases.  The pool was lovely, but the food at the restaurant needs some work, expensive for what it was, and it wasn't very good.  Apart from that the place was fine."
Bit of a walk to western food restaurants
You get what you pay for. Break fast is nice. Service is good.staff are polite
It was ok for the money I paid.
low quality of facility
"We spent x 2 nights, and in comparison to other hotels of similar values the breakfast wasn’t buffet , there was a
Set menu and you could only pick and have one serving, also found the staff not as helpful as other similar hotels.  Will most likely not be staying here again."
"Very loud and poor (intermittent) wifi. Staff were friendly, however."
poor of education for saffs and workers
"*One hotel receptionist (Putri) was a nice person & Night shift restaurant team, house keeping were nice also. 
-But, the other Receptionist & other Morning team restaurant, hemm..!!
-No breakfast buffet."
For a real review of this property in an upcoming video sub to my YT channel. BryceAllwin
"Very bad, the booked room is different to what they give."
"This hotel has been my preference whenever I land in Bali for business. Its close to airport, close to the Kuta madness, with a gorgeous pool area, friendly staff, some pretty nice rooms and completely affordable..
I don't normally leave reviews, but I felt I had to leave one after my last stay at the Ohana. Again, the staff was exceptional, courteous and always smiles. It truly felt like home. 
Again, the hotel is next to everything. Breakfast was excellent. The food overall was amazing. 
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in Bali for holiday or business. Definitely worth it."
"I stay 5 night at Ohana Hotel and its my first time to Bali Kuta. So far this is my first choice in Bali for the next trip cause their friendly staff, guest service and cleanliness. Everytime when they walk passed us they greeted us like we been treated like a big boss. Food there was delicious, every breakfast I asked for omelette cheese. The pool just infront of my room where you can just open your door and run out and jump to the pool. Overall my stay there was really awesome and wonderful. Keep up the good work Ohana staffs."
"Always a pleasure staying at the Ohana Hotel. My family and I have frequently spent our holidays here. Great value for money. The staff are especially accomodating, friendly & treat you just like their name suggests (OHANA) 'Family'. Rooms are immaculate and cleaned daily. Located only a stones throw away from Kuta Square, Markets, Kuta Beach, Waterbom Park, Discovery Mall & numerous restaurants on main strip of Jl Kartika Plaza. You won't be disappointed. Book now, kick back, relax & enjoy your holiday! Thank you Ohana Hotel - can't wait for the next holiday."
