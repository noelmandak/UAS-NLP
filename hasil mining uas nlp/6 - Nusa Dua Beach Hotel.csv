"Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is a truly fantastic resort, offering guests the perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and stunning natural beauty. From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the breathtaking views of the crystal-clear waters of the Indian Ocean and the lush tropical gardens surrounding the property.
The rooms at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa are spacious, elegantly decorated, and equipped with all the modern amenities one could need. The beds are incredibly comfortable, and the views from the balconies are simply breathtaking. The resort also features several excellent dining options, serving delicious local and international cuisine.
What sets Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa apart, however, is the level of service provided by the staff. They are always willing to go above and beyond to make sure that guests have a truly memorable experience. From arranging activities and excursions to helping with recommendations for local restaurants and shops, the staff truly makes guests feel like royalty.
The resort's spa is a true highlight, offering a range of relaxing and rejuvenating treatments using natural ingredients. The facilities are top-notch, and the therapists are highly skilled, making for an incredibly pampering experience.
In conclusion, I would highly recommend Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing beach holiday in Bali. The combination of stunning natural beauty, comfortable accommodations, excellent service, and first-class spa facilities make this resort a truly exceptional place to stay. I cannot wait to visit again in the future!"
"I’m glad I choose this hotel for our Bali trip with family and family’s friends. Beautiful location, beautiful hotel with classic Balinese touch. It may not be a sparkling new trendy hotel but it definitely has everything we want to have for this holiday. I fully recommend this hotel for its value for money, location, private beach, very comfy beds, evening event of dinner with fire dance or Barong dance, and many more! It could be exceptional if they improve daily variation for the breakfast. The daily breakfast menu is okay, the coffee is good, wide variety of menu, it’s just that the menu stayed the same during our stays, and there is no fresh meat option (beef, poultry, etc), the breakfast meat are all processed meat (smoked chicken, salami, etc). However, we came to Bali to enjoy meals outside so it’s not a big problem for us. Plus this hotel has every other aspects check positively in our list, hence, don’t make the breakfast review hold you back from booking this hotel."
"Everything perfect from, area, location, hospitality, room, service, staf, you get more value from what you pay. We stay in Club palace room we got big room with terrace & nice view garden. We had free Breakfast, afternoon tea & cocktail hours included from the price room we paid. Is really pleasure & pleasant to get that. Certainly we will recommended with everybody want to have best hotel to stay in Bali. Book this hotel, enjoy all service  & comfort to experience."
"We lived everything here . Very beautiful resort and super friendly staff . Stunning and clean beach . You can walk wall along the see passing all neighboring resorts . 
The only inconvenience that there no local restaurants around besides the overpriced once at the resorts . But still can take a can and drive to the main town . Still would come back here again . Thank you"
Really enjoyed our stay in the club lagoon. The free breakfast and tea time was very nice. The resort is on the beach which is beautiful. Staff were very kind and attentive. The resort is older but it has a palace feel to it. Only downside (in my opinion) is that the drinks on the resort are VERY expensive compared to elsewhere. Example: Large Bintangs are about 105 idr but you can buy these for about 40 idr down the street at the convenient store. Food was very good and so are the hotel amenities. Would recommend staying here!
"We stay for 6nights in Nusadua beach resort & spa. First we booked for 3nights in deluxe club palace room & we extand for more 3nights in suite club palace room. The hotel, the room, the staf, the equipment, the sanitary, the interior, the garden all is perfectly done with Balinese design room, building, garden all the serenity put together in this hotel. Feel amazing relax & the hospitality from the staf really make us feel  want to comeback to this hotel. Book your holiday & stay in Nusadua beach resort & spa."
"Photos do NO JUSTICE! Everything about this hotel is beyond my expectation, it's a classic and authentically Balinese resort, with huge land and complete facilities
The room is super clean dan fuctional, with decent size and super beautiful view. We stayed at Deluxe Room Garden View (the cheapest), and we already got superb big and beautiful garden with pond!
The facilities super complete, the swimming pool with sands, basketball court, fitness centre, tennis court, etc
The hotel is super calm and quiet, (not like the other hotel at Nusa Dua which usually loud and noisy and crowded), so i really recommend here for healing
The breakfast also quite decent, lot of variation. Super good compared with the other hotel at Nusa Dua
SUPER SURPRISED AND DEFINITELY WILL COME BACK. Become one of my best 3 hotel at Nusa Dua. See you again soon!"
"Our 1st trip to Bali started at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa. It did not disappoint. We had an amazing time here for 6 days, starting with the breakfast buffet which was delicious. We then headed to the amazing pools inc water aerobics which was so much fun, the ocean was lovely & warm and quite clean. The restaurants were very nice (1 was closed). I loved the Balinese beach ladies who have a beachside cabana set up for massages - heavenly indeed . The gardens are just beautiful, and the resort is very good for families with so many facilities for kids. We will be back again next year 🌸"
"Very peaceful place, calm with nice view and scenery. The kids enjoyed the pool, room and kid’s club, with nice and warm hearted staff. The staff provided the complimentary birthday celebration for my 4 yo son😍 we really happy with the stays and overall are good 👍🏼"
"Nice hotel, very large property with many facilities, nice staff, nice room upgrade, beautiful private beach, one of the best location in Nusa Dua. Not saying the breakfast is bad, it does have wide variety but it’s kinda plain when there isn’t new meat menu (chicken/beef, etc).  Just improve the breakfast and everything will be perfect."
"This is a wonderful hotel that is so close to the beach and has several activities that you can participate. There are several pools, a wonderful spa, fitness center, game room, and great dining options. The employees are very kind and thoughtful. This is great for people that want a more traditional-local style hotel instead of a modern ambiance. We also appreciated the level of safety including the testing of the tsunami alarm, the signs throughout the hotel, and easy access. Very recommended and great price!"
"This was our first destination when we got to Bali. Hotel is very large, staff very kind and helpful. The breakfast buffet was large, but could have better quality of food (especially fruits). Rooms were clean, spacious and beds comfortable. Spa is amazing, especially the pool, which offers lots of shade and tranquility.
The beach isn't private, but the sun chairs are, which is nice. You can also get some shade. Beach overall was nice and clean. There is a pathway along the coastline, so it is very convenient for walks.
The restaurants at the hotel are okay-ish, but absolutely overpriced."
"Room itself is not fancy, but clean. 
Pools, surrounding area, restaurants are beautiful. Lanscape around is spectacular both day and nigth."
"Besides the convenience stay with great facilities, the staff were so friendly and nice that they tried to serve the complimentary birthday celebration for my son🥰 overall is satisfied and recommended stay with kids especially 😍 my kids really enjoyed the kid’s club activities there🤩"
Stayed 4 nights at this hotel. Breakfast had a great range to choose from and the pool and private beach were great. There is a walk way which allows you to walk along the beach front to visit all the other resorts in the area. There were quite a number of guests that were on a 5 day Luxury Escapes package including food and free cocktails 3-6pm. This would have been great value however we did not see this when we were booking our trip. Staff were very helpful and the Romantic Dinner organised for the Saturday night was a great success.
"Very huge resort with clean beaches and above all, no dogs at beach area. Adorable birds and squirrels moving around at breakfast place. Beautiful sunrise, very very kind staff specially Pa Diana and Bu Puri. Thanks for making our stay a wonderful one. Enjoyed every bit of it. Thanks to Agoda for very special offer."
This hotel is just the best. With impeccable service and super friendly staff we were treated exceptionally well. The palace club may cost a little more but it is worth every cent. The room was perfect for our needs with the most comprehensive range of toiletries we have come across in our travels. The gardens are lovely and the Balinese style adds the finishing touch.
"Amazing value for money! Huge rooms - great facilities - clean beach - very friendly and helpful staff - good food - and quiet! What more can one ask for in Bali! 
Unfortunately - even though the hotel has a capacity of 500+ rooms, only 20 were occupied. Very sad from a business perspective. 
So please do consider this hotel - it's fantastic and maybe you can help the staff by making sure they stay employed."
for a large resort there is no place better with amazing balinese architecture great facilities friendly helpful staff who will always guide you in the best way.  the food is great along with the entire atmosphere
"This hotel was quite big, with 4 pools, several restaurants and right by kuta beach (white sand)! lots of activities to do or just chill and relax. The spa is expensive. They have a free hourly shuttle bus to Bali collection mall. This mall is a bit overpriced but has many restaurants. We went one night to an Indonesian resto and they dropped us back for free as the shuttle bus is only until 6 pm.  From the Bali collection, you can walk to Jalan Pantai Meniyat, which is a shopping street and market (nice to walk even at night). If you ask, many of the massage/resto will drop you back after you avail them."
"The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is a classic.  The rooms are slightly dated but very clean and comfortable.  It is in a great location,  the staff were wonderful,  the beach and pool are beautiful and the breakfast was delicious.  We will definitely be back."
Great value 5 star hotel on a beautiful beach and the gym and spa facilities are great. Restaurants are a bit overpriced for Bali standards (although pretty par for the course in Nusa Dua) and the Nusa Dua area is totally dead at the moment but can't fault them for that. Enjoyed our stay
"This is a great hotel. Facility and staff are excellent. Has private beach, pool, bars and great relaxing environment. Only thing I would recommend is more vegetarian  and gluten  free choices."
Our stay at Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa was wonderful in every aspect except the weather. If you can fix that we’ll give you a medal!
We loved our stay. Perfect for our family. Kids loved the pools and beach. The staff were so accommodating and helped us book drivers for excursions on a moments notice. It was my husbands birthday and we came back to a cake in our room. So impressed!
"Nice hotel, nice private beach. However they put deluxe room has bathtub in the agoda. So i check in at 3PM, and have to deal with the room changes, etc and able to rest in proper room at 8PM. So it’s a bit wasting time. Special thanks to mbak Puri, being so polite and kind solving the issue."
"Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa is a perfect place to stay especially if you’re on honeymoon because the location is private and you will feel safe to walk around within the area. The staffs also very helpful, no complaints on that. Overall I would love to come again and stay at this hotel."
"We enjoyed our stay for four nights.  Our teenagers thought it was boring as we had to shuttle to the shopping centre if we wanted to leave the resort.  The kids like the hustle and bustle of Legian and Kuta. This resort is much more suitable for older couples to relax and enjoy the facilities and beautiful landscaped gardens and beach. We loved the spa lap pool it was so nice to swim and rest afterwards on the pool day beds. Breakfast disappointing with no Asian food choices.  The rooms are a little tired, although the beds are luxurious, so comfortable. This resort is definitely worth staying at for a few days as it is beautiful."
Hotel is in great location.. room is clean.. food is good n value for money.. staff are firendly. Highly recommended
all the staff very helpful. amazing and hopefully can go back to Bali as soon as possible. thank you Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and spa team.. great to know all of you there
"What a lovely way to spent our last night in Bali. Clean beaches and immaculate gardens with no rubbish or plastic littered anywhere.  Also location has no burning rubbish smells like the rest of Indonesia. It was so nice to eat at the restaurants without anyone smoking. It’s no smoking area. Only smoking area at the bar area. People with allergies can feel comfortable they won’t be sick from people smoking. 
I will he love to visit again."
Wonderful resort on the beach. Great architecture. Excellent service
"Wonderful place, food and entertainment the best"
Hotel was built years ago but still well maintained. They can do better in room maintenance to fix some of the fittings. Overall we really enjoyed our stay in the hotel. Thank you for the hospitality.
"Everyone working at the hotel were extremely kind, helpful and polite. We felt welcomed. Great service. 
The room rates were great value for money.
They are trying their best to come out of the pandemic- rooms need some work to be done but nothing major. Would highly recommend."
"Everything about this place is amazing, beautiful beach, good music, clean rooms. Good food."
"Was just so awesome to stay here. The staff was courteous, food was delicious and even the location was just Wow"
Everything is amAzing here. Will de finally come back
Resort is exceptionally big and well maintained.  Having mutilple big swimming pools and other recreational activities.  Beach view is quiet scenic and very airy which is really pleasant.
"We had a super fun experience at this hotel. Super friendly staff! Very recommended for family holiday and for fun watersports experience! We extended our stay From 1 night to 3 nights. Although the rooms are a bit old but still clean. Would be excellent if they renovate the rooms because they have best location in nusadua, clean and calm sea."
Resort is a bit old and was operational only to 20 % capacity however well mantained with great facilities. It is part of itdc nusa dua between sofitel and westin. Great location great beach great facilities  at half the price of other resorts.
"One thing good is it's near to Bali International. Also, it is convenient to attend conference."
Location smack on the beach and service outstanding. Lost suitcase and staff helped me to get a hotel polo and amenities to help me thru. Even got flowers and a birthday cake presented for my special day at no charge. Made my day really special
"I really love this hotel, it's a 5 star property. I am damm sure everyone love this property for stay"
Very privatised beach and chill place for families and couple. Would love to visit again.
"Stayed for 2 nights with friends, having lotsa fun in Nusa Dua beach. Breakfast is good. Spacious room. We stayed during the pandemic so there aren't so many tourists like it used to be, and we're sure that the hotel is taking serious measurement for prevention. Thanks for taking care of us during our stay!"
"It was our honeymoon and the prepared the room very well, the hotel is very nice and clean and comfy the price is very perfect you get a great experience with a minimum value , the breakfast was delicious and contains lots of choices, the hotel was big and active where you can find many places to hang out between the beach the pool and verity of restaurants in there , we loved the place and will definitely come back again"
Nusa Dua Hotel and Spa is perfect for. peaceful time for a family to relax and recharge
"The location on a clean uncrowded beach is great. The beautiful grounds are very well maintained. The staff are all nice,   friendly and professional. The only drawback is there is not much entertainment in the evening, except for the Fire dance buffet and Kecak dance buffet twice a week."
Among the best place to stay
"Highly Recommended Best Resort, the staff are all warm and friendly. Beach and Pool and location are so nice. Worth your money. During this pandemic safety measures are strictly observed. Will surely be back."
"Nusa dua beach resort is awesome in every way. Great location, food, very friendly staff, and truly 5 star."
The hotel is massive! We had an excellent stay. Food can get quite pricey but you can always opt to explore the restaurants outside the hotel. Be sure to try the spa! Everything was great!
We had a great 4 nights there. Couldn't fault it in any way.
All are perfect. Kudos
Conveniently close to a nice small surf break. High quality place. But far from everything though. You get a bit tired of the same thing every day. Lots of fluffing around with bills for food and drinks. Great staff as always Balinese people are the friendliest people on this planet and make you happy with their big friendly smiles and welcoming greetings
beautiful bali charm with friendly staff and wonderful beach and facilities.
"Nice resort
Good spa
Delicious foods
Convenient and quick service"
Great for the price. All staff are very welcoming and helpful. Near the beach and great facilities. Options for complimentary buffet breakfast is ok. Will definitely book again when we get back in Bali.
"Very comfortable bed, very clean room, wifi good, swimming pool great, staff wonderful."
This beautiful hotel exceeded our expectations. lovely staff.lovely food and everywhere very clean. wonderful gardens.
"Will be back with family! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The food and room service is excellent, all the restaurants serve decent local and western food!"
"Fabulous hotel on a fabulous beach with fabulous staff, yes I was impressed, Room was good size overlooking the gardens it was immaculate and cleaned every day. Staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble. the beach is well kept plenty of beds and just what I wanted a relaxing time. I would definitely visit again"
"It was such a great place for a day escape, however, there was a little things that come out from my mind. I was definitely put a do not disturb sign in the evening on the door and the next morning i surprised that the roomboy rang the bell and i found out the sign changed. I thought a child or might be people did joke, but i guessed might be another staff (suspected only) i could see from hallway cctv if i want, but it was not bother me a lot. Anyway it was just a little probelm. We will come back in April and hope this not gonna happen since i love the ambience."
Nice ambience if you want some tranquility. However quite a distance to walk to nearby shops
Very friendly and helpful staff. Great location too.
"This hotel is an old 5star hotel but already got renovation. So the room is quite large and good maintance.
Have a private beach, cozy place for spend all day on the beach."
"If you are looking for resort in Nusa dua, this one will be the best. Compare to the other results, this one provide one of the best restaurant as well as the facility in the beach."
"Great hotel with access to the Nusa Dua beach. Excellent views and one can see Mount Gunung Agung on a clear day across the blue waters! Excellent service, and the breakfast is worth it! Highly recommended."
Looking forward to coming again
"Comfortable stay, beautiful balinese decor and big compound. Easy access to the beach and the Waterblow. Only setback the renovation is a bit old for the bathroom. Breakfast spread is good. Raja's Balinese restaurant serves very good and value for money fine dining meals."
Centrally located with best value for money. Very recommended hotel at Nusa Dua.
VERY GOOOOOOOOD
Looking for a hotel to relax and enjoy a resort environment? Nusa Dua is the place.
Place was very nice. Buffet was good 😍
Palace rooms are worth the upgrade
Great resort!
The hotel is near to the beach and full of natural vibes. Great they have a kids club for young children. The only thing we hope can be upgraded is the coffee and tea in room.
"Favourite hotel, we brought family as well as sibling too. Wonderful place and service."
"Old property but the staff and their hospitality makes up for it 2x 
ITS A MUST STAY HOTEL!"
"The people were super lovely and accommodating. Rooms were a bit small but have everything you need. If you’re up for just relaxing by the pool, this is the place for you."
"Didn’t expect much, as its an old hotel. Nonetheless, facilities are still properly managed. They’re understaffed, took sometime for them to attend to your needs"
"Old hotel but worth the money. Love the beach and sand. Complete facilities, pool bar has good deal drinks, restaurant by the beach is also cool.  Will come back"
Great long weekend stay. We will be back soon
Nusa Dua is for those who want to relax and hang around the hotel.
"Solo travel or family or couple has something for everyone. Currently not much open outside of hotel shops wise.
Swimming Pools beautiful"
Highly recommend this place
"I was pleasantly surprised. While the hotel is old, it was well maintained and had soul, so to speak. Beachfront area was very nice and the food at the buffet and restaurants are very good. Room was cozy and clean."
Lovely place
The hotel is quiet old. But pretty well maintanced. And of of the cheapest hotel with beach access in Nusa Dua.
Lovely place but our  room charge in this period so expensive
Lovely place but our  room charge in this period so expensive
"The breakfast, facilities, restaurants, beaches, swimming pools were excellent! But the room were old and they even didn’t made us change our room after our complaints for the bathroom, bed, and TV. I mean we stayed for 10days, at least they know how to treat guests!"
We were quite pleased with our stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. The hotel is well-maintained and the staff is extremely attentive and hard-working. The food is good and the location is quite good.
Nice hotel
"Great amenities and my requests were given. Perfect view of the room that was given to us. The only problem is during night time if you stayed at the beach side or pool side, mosquitoes will attack you. Literally attack you, like when we went back to our room I have more than 30 mosquito bites all over my body."
The hotel has something to offer for all family members. Great beach and spa too!
"We had a relaxing holiday, rooms need updating now, they’re a little tired. Breakfast was highly recommended. Would go back 😎"
"We had a nice stay here. Room was clean and nice. Balcony was big. Bathroom was also spacious. The gym was very good. 
Pool area was huge. Beach was clean and beautiful.
Breakfast was yummy  and WiFi works fine. 
Only thing we missed was the resort activities, which were cancelled because of the covid."
"Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa is perfectly located at the centre of the Nusa Dua beach with walking access to all the local hotels. The room is spacious and relatively clean, with a few missed spots. There are 5 restaurants on site but only 4 operating. I’d recommend walking to the Marriot or the Melia for food though. The resort was not very full, and until the last day, it was easy to find a poolside chair, however on high season that would be a difficult task as there aren’t enough chairs available for the size of this hotel. The SPA was a highlight for me. Totally worth checking out. I quite enjoyed the exfoliating coffee and lime treatment they offered which ended with a glorious milk bath! The downside… the staff! Never encountered such misinformed staff. Everyone you talked to shared different and contradictory information. On our last night we were informed that one of the restaurants on site was closed and they were actually operating! The staff cannot keep up with what’s happening in their own hotel!!! 😂 Very confusing. Shuttles to nearby attractions advertised on travel sites are not being offered anymore."
"Staff was wonderful , the room could do with an update, value for money"
"I would like to give compliments to F&B staffs led by Director Mr. Neil Firman to make sure customers are satisfied with food quality. Also deluxe room was quite clean and well organized. However, toilet amenities need to be improved."
It was a lovely stay . However for a 5 stars hotel we wonder how come there is no pork. Such a pity. Otherwise it was just awesome
Nice hotel with clean beach
This is a very good hotel with good facilities. But the staff and management needs improvement especially the front desk staff. I found them least helpful despite stayed there 3 times already. They show you are not very important to them.
"It’s a straight forward walk to the convention Centre, night or day. Safe and easy."
Over all the hotel is fine
"Spacious and serene, with private beach and friendly staff"
One of the best hotel in Nusa Dua 💗
"Room temperature is not controllable. WiFi is unusable (<0.50mbps download speed in rooms), so don't count on being able to have calls, stream media, or even access web pages easily. Facilities are quite dated, but staff are friendly and nice. Also well located so you can escape the nearby hotels and enjoy their bars and restaurants instead..."
The beachside restaurant is awesome!
In room facility such as electricity facilities need to improve. Rooms are very old fashion need to renovate. Pool facilities need to improve. Towel should provide until the pool close
"Nice room but the restaurant really not good for expensive prices . I couldn’t eat my meal at all  because it was horrible . They still charge the whole meal without any excuse.
We had the aircon broken , so we couldn’t turn it off from all the night . Wit was  absolutely freezing all night , after complaining we didn’t had any apologies or sort of compensation.  Staff and service not worst 5 stars at all ."
"Location is great advantage, room is old but well maintained"
"Hotel rooms are very much dated. Other than that, staff are super friendly and facilities are good."
"Hotel surrounding is so beautiful, good facilities.
Far from Gate of Haven, It took 3 hours to arrive there from Hotel. But hotel environment is quite and relax. 
Only one thing is coffee, sugar and creamer is only for 2 person to drink 1 time. Did not top up extra. I am the coffee lover and requires to request coffee and creamer."
"Clean room, friendly staff ,but breakfast always the same stuff."
"Good ambiance and classy. 
The staff were very friendly and the breakfast menu was not satisfying. 
Need some improvement on the varieties of breakfast menu. 
Thank you"
Location is perfect but the hotel seems not well refurbished after Covid 19 Pandemic.
The hotel is relatively old and the room is dark and humid. The staff is approachable and friendly.
