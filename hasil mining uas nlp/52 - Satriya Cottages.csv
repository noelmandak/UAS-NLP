It's been a while since I stayed here and I was glad to go back. The rooms are cleaned daily and are immaculate in presentation.  A/C super good. The bathroom of our twin could do with some maintenance as the partition between shower and toilet was unstable and coming away from its mounts. The breakfast is plentiful and tasty. Staff amazing as always. Several pools with the main pool having a swim up bar. Easy access to local stalls on Poppies II and Beachwalk shopping centre.  Highly recommended!
"Landing in Kuta after a long 24 hours of travelling to Bali... you really cant go wrong by coming straight to Satriya Cottages to rest and recharge your batteries. The rooms all overlook a huge gorgeous pool area, surrounded by immaculately kept gardens. The rooms were clean spacious and cool, and well appointed with everything we needed from a safe, a mini fridge, kettle and coffee, a closet, and a nice little balcony to enjoy the sunset from .  The location is perfect! You walk out the front entrance and youre right on Poppies II - and super close to the beach. Theres loads of great shopping around, and walking distance to the few eateries that managed to survive Covid lockdowns and stayed open. We spent our few days there surfing, chilling at the pool, and drinking at the pool bar, and then back to the beach to watch sunset. I would definitely stay here again as a first stop into Bali."
"Their price is really a value for money. Everyday they change our towels and clean the room and provide bottled water.
If you're planning to stay for weeks or months and doesn't have a busy itinerary, this hotel is for you. This is near the airport as well.
The everyday breakfast buffet is also a plus. I just hope they provide authentic indonesian breakfast as well and not just a western type of food like sausages.
When I go back to Bali, will definitely book this hotel again. I hope they don't change the way they treat the customers and how they provide facilities and amenities at an affordable price."
Located in poppies 2 near beach walk shopping centre and fat chow.was impressed by how quite and clean the hotel is arriving at 2am staff were very good rooms confirmed in no time bags taken to our rooms then welcome drinks.Thanks to all of the staff at Satriya for a good holiday
"This is the first time for a long time we have stayed at this hotel. The staff are so accommodating and friendly, breakfast is fresh and great value and location is central to many restaurants and walk to shopping mall and local beach. This hotel is one of the best values in Bali. Can’t wait to come back. Thank you Satriya for a great stay. Best wishes Suzi and Arthur"
"Lovey gardens open up to beautiful pool, and awesome rooms with traditional style bathrooms. 
Very close to the beach, market stalls, massage , right out the front. 
Restaurant/bar looking out onto busy poppies 2. 
Great breakfast"
"Satriya cottages was a very central location to the things we love in Kuta. It was a short stroll to the beach bars for Bintang, close to Beach Walk shopping mall and easy access to Poppies 1 and 2 for food, beer and market shopping.
Breakfast was adequate. There were eggs, rice, noodles, fruit and toast every morning. Bacon, chicken, sausages and fish were served occasionally. You could make a coffee or enjoy juice. 
The pool was refreshing, with a well serviced swim up bar. 
Rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious. 
The 90 degree bar was great for food or cold drinks at reasonable prices. You can sit here and watch poppies 2 with out being harassed to buy everything. 
Staff were all lovely."
"Satriya Cottages is a great place to stay in Kuta - close to the beach, and the Kuta-craziness, yet go through the gates and you're in calm tropical and well kept gardens.  Staff are friendly, helpful and all round amazing.  We love this venue and return time and again.  Thank you Satriya for yet another wonderful stay."
I was a solo traveller and had issues with my flights. the staff were very friendly and they provided a fantastic service.
Not the first time traveller but first time here  I would definitely stay here again staff were absolutely beautiful
Exceptional service. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Great location and facilities
"Great location 
Amazing breakfast 
Amazing service 
Wifi not working properly in new building 
Overall good stay . 
Good value for money"
"Satriya has been a favourite resort of ours for nearly 10 years.  We always enjoy our stay.  The staff are absolutely first class in all departments.  The Location is central to restaurants, shopping and the beach.  It's a great choice to stay there."
"close to beach, shops and restaurants.  very helpful and friendly staff and clean rooms and public areas.  Have stayed there for many years and just returned from a short 6 day break and it was perfect."
"Very nice place, staff very friendly, walking distance to to beach and shops."
"Very friendly staff, great location, a couple of min of walk to the beach.  A bunch of restaurants within a few min of walk."
"First time here, won't be the last.. we loved it here.. thankyou!!"
"Very Balinese, pool, some rooms, old style charm. Very quiet, manly older couples, but in the new part younger couples. New part is not Balinese , small rooms, doesn’t feel like same hotel.
Good breakfast, fantastic staff, only downside is too many stairs"
Best place to stay in Kuta!!!!
"Among all the hotels in their rate, i believe that this hotel is the best. The location is just perfect! Just next to the biggest mall in Kuta (beachwalk mall) buuut in the same time also very quite, calm and peaceful. The staff is wonderful, the room is spacious and what i like the most is the laundry service! It’s express but the price is very reasonable. Maybe the thing that need to improve is that the wifi is not the best, but if you don’t really need super speed wifi, then it’s ok. For sure we gonna back here if we come back to Kuta!"
"Love this little hotel tucked into the bend of Poppies 2. Quiet, peaceful, green, lovely staff, indo style, perfect little spot with great value"
Great location/ great staff and value for money
"Great, clean bed,  good location"
"Great stay at the Satriya Cottages  , staff very friendly and helpful , good breakfast.
All in all we enjoyed our stay.👍👍"
Do yourself a favour and book here
"I love staying here , great location , good staff , best pool , nice big rooms"
Full recomended
overall a good place to stay
"Good location ,services, pool, food, friendly staff.
Still Needs improvement in room aminities.
Tv not work properly (204), cable issue.
But staff very helpfull to fix it..."
"Good location, friendly staff. Quiet and peaceful."
"Beautiful grounds, fantastic pool and lovely staff. 
Couldn’t ask for more!"
Our regular accommodation
Lil bit expensive
"Clean, staff very nice, safe, location is very good."
Good for the money but weak WIFI signal in room.
"Good value, nice place, weak / no wifi in the room"
My family really enjoyed staying here. The staff were very helpful and polite. The grounds and rooms were clean. We enjoyed the friendly atmosphere in and around the pool.
likethis hotel will come back
We really enjoyed our stay at the Satriya
"Great hotel. Very clean. Breakfast included, but not a big choice"
"Very good location at Kuta beach, 100m from bigest shopping mall in Kuta and the beach"
"Rooms are spacious and clean. Bathroom can be improved. Too small and dated. Breakfast ok but lack of variety if staying for more than a few days.
Staff are very obliging and friendly."
"Having 18 year old kids this was a great place to stay - convenient to Legian Street without being too close (about a 10 minute walk, or 15 minute stagger :))  Bar and restaurant prices very reasonable, heaps of friendly staff to service all of our needs and the second quiter pool in front of building 4 was a massive bonus."
"This is a budget hotel and has some nice rooms and two pools.
It's close to Kuta beach and the main shopping mall on the beach.
Its not fancy at all so if you want something more upmarket you need to be looking at Bali Mandira, NusaDua, Cangu or Sanur. Personally Sanur has a great feel and is more like old bali, chilled and more relaxed."
"Now saying this only about 80% of the staff were like this.  The bar staff were more interested in talking to each other or on their phone to worry about selling beers.  We basically had to call them every time we wanted a beer.  Reception appeared like it was all to much even to just hold my key.  On arrival no room was ready and I was sent away until 2pm.  I returned and the room was still not ready but the person in their had not checked out.  I did get up graded to another room.  
The staff in general were not friendly like all other Bali Hotels who alway say hello and friendly.  It was like all these people were sent to this hotel as a punishment."
"All good, except that a lot mosquitoes in the room. Even after they spray, new mosquitoes appear."
The hotel is traditional architecture n aesthetics of balanise culture. However the amenities such as shower and Aircondtioning hardly work! It was a chore to bathe and room was hot n stuffy. The breakfast food was bland n same menu for days on. Overall a lukewarm place to stay.
Grat hotel with lovely garden and pool
"Rooms are reasonable, wifi basically doesn't work, no hot water.  Beds not really comfortable.  Wouldn't recommend breakfast option"
It’s the traditional Balinese construction/architecture which draws me to this hotel .. receptionist very pleasant and accommodating.. location about 10 min to Beach .. more lights in bathroom  as it can be dangerous for children/elderly folks .. overall a good stay …
"If u book a standard room.be prepared to be put.at the back of the hotel facing.the street.
The balcony.cannot even fit 2 chairs on as the air.con.unit is on there.
The balcony blind.is permanently fixed.so u cannot see anything.
Breakfast was poor only few fruit options.
The area.for.breakfast is only cooled by fans and.its like a.sweat box.
We.had been travelling.around.bali for.3.wks and only booked.in.this accommodation as we.was.meeting.a.friend.who was.staying.there..
Look around a lot more.value for money."
"Nice hotel with lovely pool.
Deluxe room recommanded. Has tot a lovely bathroom.
Close to Popjes Lane II and Beach Walk Mall."
"The staff were unfriendly which will prevent us going back to this hotel. Pool staff were terrible, no greeting and general unfriendliness was felt by all 6 people in our group. Management need to address it otherwise they will not have repeat guests."
"I have never left a really bad review for a place until today. The staff could care less about your experience here. The cleaning team literally left my door unlocked multiple times during my stay here. When I let them know, they just blew me off and refused to put me in contact with a manager.
Additionally, if you need internet access in your room, you will not get it. Everyday you will be told they are ""working on it"" which is their way of telling you it's not going to happen. 
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND STAFF IS AWFUL!"
"Whenever I visit Bali I most of the time stay at Satriya Cottages. I tried other resorts and hotels, but always return to Satriya. I gave up looking for anything better at that price range. 
The staff is friendly and talk English 
The rooms and premises are clean 
The pool is wonderful. They have two. The big one has a swim up bar. 
The location is 100m from beach and many eateries within walking distance. 
Right next door too cheap laundry services outside hotel. 
Breakfast is ok. 
Wonderful band playing every evening at main restaurant area. 
Kids they love this place. So fantastic for families. 
It’s become a family tradition returning to Satriya. Thank you to Mahdi and his team."
"We very much enjoyed our stay at Satriya Cottages , the hotel and grounds are just beautiful! The main pool was also great, very big and nicely set up, with a bar as well. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and nice with a comfortable bed. The staff clean your room daily and replace towels daily. Lots to choose from with the breakfast provided in the breakfast areas. Great location only 100 metres to Kuta beach, and shopping just outside resort. The whole hotel was very nicely maintained. We highly recommend Satriya Cottages, and would definitely stay here again."
"Satriya Cottages was a wonderful place to stay in Bali! It was very clean and comfortable, with excellent beds, air conditioning, and storage, and a great bathroom setup. The room had a really nice balcony as well, with high-quality furniture and a drying rack. The pool was awesome--they keep it very clean, and provide some floats for relaxing. The swim-up bar staff was very friendly, and the drinks were great. Wonderful location close to all the action in Kuta, but set back just enough to be peaceful and quiet despite being a short walk from all the action. Breakfast was what we would expect (eggs made to order, pancakes, an assortment of potatoes/meat/Indonesian food, etc.). I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!"
"Being on my own, I was relieved and delighted that the Satriya felt safe and welcoming.  I loved the location in Poppies Lane 2 ... felt like I was back in Bali in the 80s!   So much of Bali now is a little bit generic and allot of the new style of villa and modern hotels leave me a little uninspired.  All personal choices but for me, the Satriya was the best of both worlds, having the old-school-charm but also with modern and refreshed rooms.  Wayan and all the staff really looked after me and I will take my husband next time we go to Bali and it will be our 'go to' place when we want to stay in Kuta.  I loved scooting along the beach or up the lane to shop, spa, eat or see a band.  Loads of fun!"
"we loved the stay at satriya cottages.  the grounds are beautifully kept and the rooms very big and clean.  our towels were made up into different animals every morning.  a very nice touch.  breakfast was great.  the usual egg station, but a great variety of other foods, which changed every morning.  would definitely stay here again.  not the cheapest place in bali by a long shot, but when you are on holidays, what the heck.  central between poppies i and ii, so close to lots of restaurants, markets, etc.  two minute walk to the beach."
"This was our 3rd stay at Satriya Cottages.  We keep coming back because the location is so central and close for shopping, surfing, night clubs (but you can't hear them from this property) and restaurants.  It is suitable for all types of travellers whether you are single, young couples, families or older couples.  The hotel is situated in lovely tropical gardens, has 2 swimming pools.  The rooms are very clean, the beds comfortable - housekeeping is excellent here.  The staff are always cheerful, friendly and exceedingly helpful.  The restaurant/room service has good meals and the breakfast buffet is very good now they have extended the selection.  Overall I highly recommend this hotel for an enjoyable stay - this was our 3rd time."
"I am writing this to say Satriya Cottage provides really good service and the most important part to cleanliness. The staff is very prompt in maintaining tidiness and are regular in cleaning it everyday.
I would definitely reckon for people to stay here even if its a family stay or couple or solo. 
-Walk-able distance to all amenities
-Close to not so great Kuta beach (100 mts away)
-Food, massage, local stores all of it with just 25mts away.
-Couples would definitely enjoy the stay whether they wanna stay indoors or outdoors"
"We loved Satriya Cottages, you would never know you are in Kuta once you enter the hotel, peaceful & quiet.
We stayed in the back rooms near the smaller pool, great aircon & clean.
Tried room service & massage at the hotel and both great.
Plenty of restaurants at your door step right on poppies 2 and well as mini marts, shopping, beach, transport.
Laundry $1 a kg out the back gate"
"We have stayed at Satriya Cottages many times and always go back.  The rooms are great we stayed in the deluxe rooms they were so clean and were so big compare to other rooms.  The food is amazing as always,  pool was always clean and pool bar was great. the location is also good if you like the beach,  Kuta beach is across the road,  shopping, spas and dining all walking distance.  Cant wait to return."
"I went to Bali with my friend last May 7th to 11th and definitely made the right choice when I booked for Satriya. We originally booked for another hotel but we found out that that hotel had an issue so we canceled our booking and found out about Satriya in Agoda. When we arrived, we werer given welcome drinks which we found really sweet considering that we were both sweating when we first arrived at the hotel. The room we had was old but the beds and the furniture were well-maintained. We only hated the bathroom because, well, it was really old and the door was even rusty. But the garden and the pool, and the pool bar all have relaxing aura on them that we always look forward to coming home after our whole-day tours."
"Satriya cottages is very well located, close to both the beach and the nightlife of Kuta. The rooms are spacious and well furnished but the bathroom could be refreshed and more modern (we just had a bathtub with shower but no curtain...). The isolation between the rooms is not ideal, we had noisy neighbors which prevented us to sleep until late. The gardens and swimming pool are lovely, balinese style. Overall a very nice place with good value for money, I would go there again and hope for more respectful neighbors"
"The Satriya Cottages are Balinese architecture  with nice gardens  , we booked a superior room   on the 2nd   floor which was spacious  but basic with a balcony overlooking the nice lush gardens that surround the large pool,( standard  rooms are located at the back with smaller pool) . Hotel is close to the beach , local eateries and shopping. Breakfast was OK but could be improved, not many choices with bacon  on the menu only twice a week , bread & buns were stale during our stay. Would stay again but without paying for breakfast and eat outside. There are no lifts.
 Most of the staff were friendly."
"The satriya was better than i expected. Beautifull gardens. Nice pool area with updated furniture. Nice cocktails at the pool bar. Love that the food and beverage prices are nett no taxes. Makes it very affordable. Stayed in a standard room in the new block
at the back with its own breakfast area/bar/pool. Fantastic!! So nice not having to deal with kaos at breakfast. Lovely snd chilled. Back gate to go down the maize of lanes between poppies one and two. Love it there, such a fantastic location with a short cut access into the sheraton shopping centre from poppies 2."
"Have to say was really pleased chose Satriya Cottages. The room was little disappointing and needs decoration and smell of damp whole time but we never complained as was all fine. Staff were very friendly, pool was lovely and gardens made you feel so relaxed and miles from hustle and bustle of Katu. Massage services were also very good. Would recommend."
"i always stay at Satriya Cottages,the best i know the staff,every time i turn up they greet me with such friendship,the best it is real Balinese stile u think you are in Bali"
"when we were driving up poppies lane ii to satriya cottages i couldn’t help thinking: oh dear, this is going to be crammed and noisy and ugly… far from the truth, it´s an oasis. the entrance is already quite impressive, but the vegetation, the swimming-pool area and the set up make it a beautiful place. the room is very spacious, it is getting old and there are some signs of decay, but nothing put us off. breakfast has quite a lot of options, try the fresh watermelon juice!, while you have a look at the palm trees. it is located like a 5 minute walk from the beach and surrounded by all types of shops and restaurants. we met an aussie guy who comes there every year with his family for an entire month. that’s nowhere near my type of vacation… but i can see why."
"We stayed one night in the new addition of rooms in the back of the building since they were cheaper than the cottages. The rooms were really clean and had all the amenities you would need. Very nice and new bathroom with a great shower! 
There are 2 swimming pools on the property, one even has a swim up bar! The provided breakfast in the morning was a ton of food with lots of diversity - omelet bar, lots of pastries, fruit, eggs/sausage, and of course rice and noodles!
Great location across the street from Kuta beach and a short walk to Jl Legian, that is the center of Kuta nightlife.
One thing to note is that they only provide 2 very small bottles of water, so you need to make sure to buy your own drinking water!
Great value for the cost and great location for doing all things Kuta!"
"We are lucky to have stayed at Satriya Cottages for our holiday. Perfect location and very warm, hospitable staff ( special mention to Putu and Kadec). Higly recommend it to my friends and will definitely stay here again."
We Love Satriya Cottages. Perfect location. 2 minutes from kuta beach. Great pool. Delicious food. The staff are very nice.
Just returned from a 4 night stay at Satriya it was a excellent place to stay so relaxing and peacefully quiet once you step through the gates of Satriya but still in the heart of busy Kuta and Poppies II and a close walk to everything. Only negetive breaky a little boring. All Staff so helpful would stay again.
"Friendly staff, resident cats 😁 swim up bar, great location, walking distance from beach, shopping, transport, food, clubs etc. there is a laundry service in the rear lane that is very cheap, fast and good quality."
Near to beach and many eateries along the beach side. Hotel comes with the pool and friendly staff
"I have stayed here on numerous occasions and the staff, rooms and service is exceptional."
"Great value, close proximity to beach, shopping and dining,2 lovely swimming pools, great food"
"This hotel gives you value for your money. 
The location is good, it's 100m away from the beach. But it's not really beach front. There is a small alley that you have to pass through. It's ok if there is daylight because the stalls are open. But once its 7pm onwards, the shops close and there is not enough light in the alley. We usually use our phone so we wont stumble or fall. 
In terms of food, they give you value for money. We ordered room service for lunch and dinner. The food was yummy and the price was  just right. For breakfast, it was adequate. But for the price that youre paying and the convenience, its great. 
In terms of the pool, it is exactly like the pictures. However, I did not get to enjoy the pool so much because I was itching. I dont know if Im just allergic to something or what. My friend didnt have the same problem. 
The staff were absolute treasures. We arrived at 130PM and the room was not ready yet. The person at the reception asked if it was okay if they give us a different room that was ready. We really wanted to check in so we said yes. The room they gave us was our own cottage. They explained that we might be disappointed because what we booked was different from what they gave us. But we were already ok with the cottage. What was important was that it was in the ground floor. We actually didnt care about the view. They were suppose to give us a room in the 2nd floor with the balcony faving the pool. But for us, the ready room which was 10m away from the lobby and 20m away from the restaurant was good. 
Also, I would like to commend the staff who asked if we wanted to have them clean our room. On the 2nd day we were there, we just wanted to sleep. We were sleeping until about 1pm. The housekeeping staff knocked and asked us if we wanted housekeeping. Howevere, because we were so tired, we declined. After 10 minutes, the staff knocked again to give us new towels. I loved their attention to detail. Although we didnt ask for new towels,"
"Overall good experience but one needs to be aware that most rooms are not exactly cottages but part of a block. Also, there is another block /wing which used to be a different hotel at a lower standard, but is now part of Satriya. Our room was in that other wing, which had no view, far from the pool etc"
"Great hotel and best value for money. Pools are great and a good size, pool music is very good, buffet breakfast had plenty to choose from. The grounds are well maintained and the staff are friendly and funny. They have own money changer which was competitive with others. We used one of their contracted drivers to take us around (all day excursions for 5 pax) for reasonable fare. Shops, massage right out front. Beach short stroll at end of street, taxis are everywhere and cheap when they have their meter on, restaurants are close (there are some warungs tucked away behind the cottages…just go for a wander and you will find them). They have cheap laundry service (or you will find laundries just behind cottages out back). Overall I was very impressed and will stay again."
"Satriya Cottages is a well maintained clean and comfortable property.
It is close to Beach front Mall, beach, markets, restaurants, and good value."
"Very comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. Close to everything"
"Locally i have laundry service, beach, motor bike hire, beach, mall, cinemas, restaurants. Great location. Well looked after, clean rooms, plenty of hot water, and great price."
"Great location 
Friendly staff
Cheap drinks and food
Only drawback
Loud music around pool mostly doff doff played by staff
Will change if requested and lower a little but having there own party
If your looking for a affordable  party place  this is the place"
Poor internet... needs upgrading to meet todays modern needs.
"Satriya was excellent value,  a bit old, but good value. Staff were excellent. Breakfast good as was restaurante."
"Absolutely love Satriya Cottages. Staff, location and price."
"A very well run, Balinese family owned hotel, with great staff."
"A very well run, Balinese family owned hotel, with great staff."
"A very well run, Balinese family owned hotel, with great staff."
"Big Mall ,beach,eating places ,shopping places, Jalan kaki saja"
Beautiful place Kuta central without street noise.
"1st of all the booking not sure why have to make separately, booked 3 nights with 3 different booking numbers. During booking it said 2nd night with promotions rate but didn't get that rate!
We were traveled with 20kg luggage and stayed at 3rd floor, without lift! 
Too many stairs to reach every where, it is not suitable for disability people.
The sewage system has problem, stink smell when we flushed the toilet."
"Vere good place for beach,good area of Kuta"
Great location. Staff very friendly and helpful. Loved the 2nd pool right at the front of our room felt like own private pool. Breakfast could improve but that was a very minor detail. Everything else fabulous.
"The most disappointing thing about this hotel was the lack of staff interest.  On my second day at the hotel I had decided to stay by the  pool, but there were no clean pool towels, I was told it would be 5 min, however no towels all day.  On the third day I slept in, and I was reprimanded by two different staff members saying I was "" late for my breakfast"" I arrived at 10:10 and the service finishes at 10.30, most of the food had already been cleared.  My review in conclusion was the location is really good, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff were not as friendly or accommodating as I have experienced in other hotels in Bali."
"We have stayed here many times the rooms are big and clean, great pool with swim up bar and the staff have always been amazing!"
"We loved staying at Satriya with friends. They had stayed several times but our first. Loved the place very traditional and the pool was warm, pool bar great too. Laundry and spa on site very affordable. Breakfast fine pancakes, egg station, pastries, fruit, juice and tea/coffee all  you need. Rooms were spacious and clean. Would definitely recommend and we will stay again. Such good value for money"
"Rooms are large, clean and cool. 
2 pool bars,
Good food and service at the in-house restaurant. 
Quick access to everything once you pick landmarks 😂"
"Basic breakfast nice large rooms , air conditioned good location"
Fantastic location very close to everything but very quiet.  Stayed in one of the cottages and it was lovely.  Pool fantastic.  The staff were lovely too.  If you don't like climbing stairs make sure when booking that you request the older part of the cottages and not the new rooms.
"Very impressed with the service and the hotel, lovely staff ready to help at all hours, always happy and if there were any problems they where fixed before we could check again ! Great service for a great price! Took the stress out of first time holidaying and will book again !"
"We had a couple of nights here as other family members were staying here.  They actually were in the cottages and we got a room in the new section more of a hotel style.
The staff are very nice, breakfast is basic but good.
My only complaint would be that we unfortunately ended up in the room, where right outside was the dining area so from when they started to set up the tables in the mornings quite early 6.00am ish then we would be automatically woken up.  Such a shame they put rooms right in this area when building them but I understand that they need to get as many rooms in as possible.
Other than that the stay was very enjoyable."
"We loved our room in the new section with pool access.  Only stayed one night...it’s close to everything, including the airport. Pretty grounds, nice staff, great value.  Would stay here again."
"Our room was great, but it was one of the better rooms. Had to stay in a standard room for half day late checkout, not very nice, you get what you pay for. Grounds are great, pool great, location great. Breakfast is your standard eggs anyway you like with six different sides. nothing flash but does the job. This is the second time we have stayed here and will return again."
"Staff were friendly, all clean and lovely. However, two days out our trip the pool was off limits. One for a 50th and one for a wedding. One was the last day and we deliberately took a late plane to spend the last day at the pool. They should have advised us upon booking and not just on the day of the events. It was a disappointing finish with no pool facilities/bar etc. all afternoon and night for a wedding. We wouldn’t have booked an 11pm flight if we knew at 2pm there was no where to be. The tiny back pool had no ladders and was under repair."
On arrival I requested a ground floor room which they provided. First the door latch broke which they repaired. Then the shower handle fell off which they just sat on and told us not to put water on all the way. Then I slipped on water from the air conditioner which they fixed. We were not allowed to use pool with bar for 2 days. Once for a 50th birthday and then a wedding. The 90 degrees bar and restaurant on site had amazing food. Upon leaving they told me I had to pay an extra $150au as the room they put us in was “superior “ 👎
Nothing extraordinary but a pleasant place to stay with friendly staff. The Superior room are spacious but the facilities such as bathrooms need an overhaul. Reasonably quiet except for the occasional noisy stop-out coming back late at night. Pool area is good and breakfasts are reasonable..Would stay there again because of its central location near the beach...
Garden and position
"Great location and convenient to everything.....pool is lovely, rooms are spacious but wish we stayed in a bungalow as they looked really nice, restaurant food was always yummy and we had many meals there and the cocktails were delicious too....Staff were super friendly and we got a free airport transfer as we stayed longer than 3 nights....cute shops outside hotel and nice restaurants as well.....I would definitely stay here again"
"Great location in Kuta.2 minute walk to beach.has a swim up bar.breakfast is basic with what you need. Have stayed before on ground floor and loved it but this time was on third floor which we hated.,but they were fully  booked with no ground floor rooms .my 70 year old mum struggle with stair.i was ok first few times but it got harder and made you not want to constantly go out..rooms were great size.."
"the hotel is well located in a quiet little street but a few steps from the main street. It is a beautiful structure but it is divided into two zones, a very nice and typical first area, for what I have noticed also the rooms internally are interesting with a typical atmosphere. A senconda wing of the hotel where I was there is certainly more anonymous in particular the interior of the rooms. However they are quite large and comfortable with a relaxing balcony."
"Upside- value for money-some of the staff are awesome ( the men that cleaned the rooms made animals out of the towels and the kids loved it)- good pool area- satisfactorily breakfast 
Down side-after dinner the wifi was almost unusable (think dialup speed) never any knifes and forks on the breakfast tables - one of the staff at the pool bar could do with putting a smile on the dial 🙂
We would stay again"
"The cottages (61) are located at the end of a lane that is over the road from the Kuta beach. They are very quiet, set in a beautiful garden with a pool. There are a variety of units.   I stayed in a Superior Room overlooking the beautiful gardens. This was very spacious with terrace, bath, separate shower, air-conditioning fridge, tea and coffee making facilities and good wifi.  Breakfast was buffet style with a good variety. Staff were friendly and helpful. Highly recommended"
Friendly staff very helpful felt very welcomed
"The location is very quiet at night even if it is located in the business center, ideal for a very good vacation indeed. I’ll surely go back here soon!"
The superior room was huge and very nice. Great value for money. Great pool opened till 22:00. An amazing garden with traditional Balinese design. The restaurants offer good quality food at very low prices. Totally recommended!!!
"Loved this place. The rooms were great the staff were excellent, always going out of their way to help. Breakfast was buffet style with lots of options. Great location - markets just outside the door, restaurants too, and only a couple of hundred meters from the beach. I'd definitely stay here again."
"Loved this hotel. Our room was so clean. White sheets and towels every day. Beautiful staff and ground and pool area amazing. Only down side was breakfast, very average."
