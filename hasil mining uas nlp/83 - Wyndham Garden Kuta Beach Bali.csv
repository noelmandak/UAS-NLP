"Nice hotel. Modern room layout. Lighting abit dark with close curtain. No view as I'm staying on 2nd floor. Clean and comfortable bed. One problem, the toilet using sliding door. The gap between the door and the toilet is big, about 3cm gap so you can see your friend shit.. breakfast is fine... some dishes are good, some are not..."
"The location is really a prime just beachfront Kuta.
The hotel is good, the breakfast, the facilities, they develop it.
It could be elevated with the cleanliness of the bathroom, but else it value the money.
It's a really good choice for those who want to get in the location but don't want to pay the overprized hotel at same location.
Nice place to chill, they have good restaurant and cafe to chill the whole day.
Nice and friendly staffs"
Glad to stay on my last day in Bali. I have an early morning flight so location is good and near airport. Theres a nice sea view and its just opposite the hotel. A lot of food and mall is just walking distance from the property
"In front of beach.
Along the way to the hotel have mall, great restaurant, bar & cafe.
Very happening at night.
The breakfast is superb with variety of food. The hotel is clean have 3 pools. Will stay here again if coming to Bali."
"I had a spine problem so Wyndham bed is great for me. It was on the firm side and i love how the bed still feels new, and you can't feel the springs on your back. I had the best sleep and it's the best feeling after a long day at the beach. The FO staffs were especially helpful, friendly and also very accommodating during my stay. Definitely will come back again!"
"Hotel facing Kuta  beach .Very convenient and hotel staff very friendly .
Breakfast very good."
"if you want Kuta this is nice, very near to kuta beach, alot of resto around and mall is nearby. Good value for money"
"Nice view, quiet and cleaniness on top and give us very comfort sleep during 2 night stays. 
Only thing need to improved, probably safety and security and investing more on cleanliness water.
1) Safety and Security - Found need to improve because this is under prime location and since the Bali Bombing, security need to be in place across all the hotel and resort  and this resort is also should be included. 
2) Cleanliness Water - Since checking with staff there saying in progress of investing with chlorine water filtration because currently cannot boil directly from water tap. Overall cleanliness water to bath and brush teeth are OK except using the tap water to boil water."
"Best experience with great service, nice room, has large bed in room. Best location for shopping either to beach walk shopping center or Pasar Seni Kuta."
Located opp the Kuta beach this hotel is value for money - go for it!
Hotel with great value in the strategic location
"Good Locations & Rates, breakfast was ok and could be better with more choices. Room was ok and clean, still have area for improvement for the rooms. Will stay here again if the rates was still affordable....."
"Excellent location next to the beach, in general the hotel is very good, but they are still in maintenance procedures. Breakfast is adequate. The hotel staff is friendly, but most of them are under training. The rooms are clean, but the pillows need to be renewed"
"Perfect location, perfect, absolutely super amaizing crew… next time, straight to this hotel."
"good place with cheap price
and the breakfast is good 👍🏻👍🏻
the staff is very good 👍🏻 👍🏻
have a nice stay.."
The hotel is located at good locations whereby many amenities and food is nearby. Everything is in walking distance and the food nearby is good. Good pool view and near to the beach.
"Kuta beach just cross of the road, convenience store is next building. Walking distance to Legian area. Easy to catch grab or taxi."
Was pleasantly surprised by this hotel in terms of its location to Kuta beach along with the very affordable rates. You'd be hard pressed to find great lodging at an affordable price this close to Kuta beach!
Looking forward to stay at the new room
Cheers to front office officer Mr. NANA for his absolute genuine hospitality. Magnificent location with many shops in walking distance and the beach just opposite the hotel. The trip To nusa peninda was beyond out of our expectations ❤️ Surely will return soon
I love the breakfast
"Hotel Close to beach
I love it"
"Beach, marts and taxis are nearby. The staffs is very helpful"
"In the Kuta area, this hotel is right across the beach. It is beside a mall. It is relatively near to the airport.
The location is very accessible and getting around is not a problem. Due to the location, expect traffic as well. The free breakfast is a plus!
Rooms are big and clean. One star down because the aircon in our first room did not function and we had to move rooms. A lot of road work, renovation maintenance work around the hotel is still ongoing as well."
the best hotel with low budget in the best location 👍🏻👍🏻
location is great. close to beach and mall
"Superb king size bedroom , great food, friendly staff and location in the heart of kuta"
Good services. Nice and kind staff
"Book it as Mt last resort , great price , good room , could use some TLC ..but given location and what this region when thru all condition where acceptable...plus right in front of kata Beach and a very busy pedestrian life"
Great for the price and the staff is extremely helpful and very cheerful! My friend came down with a bleeding ulcer at 2am and the security guard on duty rushed to help us and made sure we made it to the closest hospital ASAP. Really a great place and a great price too. I would mostly certainly return here if I ever return to kuta. I believe it was recently renovated too!
Have Fun for all...
Have many pools and my rooms have  upgraded
Got a free upgrade during my stay! Thanks to the wonderful staff especially at the restaurant section.
"the bathroom was smelly of something but its ok because we just stay for one night but when we checked out we told the staff about that to fix it , I love this place is so close to the shopping Center we just only walk for 7-10 mins"
"- The shower was AWESOME! 
- The staff were very helpful and accommodating. 
- Great location - can't see the beach, but literally across the road. 
- They're renovating, but it didn't affect our stay. 
- The welcome drink is non-alcoholic (lol) but good coffee-to-go. 
- The rooftop pool was in another building, so a bit of a mission to get there, and there were trees blocking the view. 
- I thought it was a tad overpriced, but that's only because other accommodation in Bali is very cost-effective. Anywhere else in the world it would be great value. 
- Overall a good stay."
"It is a great location. The hotel is just right opposite the beach, and it just take 5 min walk to Beachwalk Shopping Mall.
You must also try their massage. They will come to your room and the price is reasonable ~ IDR240,000/HR"
"The location is top notch right in front of the Kuta Beach, but beware of the parking you might miss the hotel on the  first drive. 
The staff are nice, the room quite spacious and the bed is huge."
"Thank you for making our stay pleasant, we had a rough start but after changing rooms we had an amazing time here, a big thank you to all the Staff."
"Fairly good hotel with perfect location at the central of Kuta town. Walking distance to mall / convenience shops / beaches. Bathroom water pressure is strong. Only downside maybe is the light is abit dim to be my liking, but that's my personal preference. Cheers@!"
"The location is good, the price is reasonable"
"If you want hotel that located near kuta beach & value for money, so this hotel maybe fit for you."
Highly recommended
"Comfortable stay. However, some of the wing are closed hence one of the pool is closed too."
Very friendly staff and accommodative. A 4 star hotel that is poorly maintained which is why it's so cheap. Located right in front of Kuta Beach is the only reason why you would choose this place. Some rooms have poor AC systems and smelly toilet pipes but the staff was nice enough to move me.
It was value for money but the hotel is not exactly as the pictures show it's looking tired and needs some more work .the outside of the building is dated but looks like they have done so.e upgrades. The breakfast was not great not enough choices. The pool at the front is okay but the soft furnishings need replacing.  The staff are  pleasant . I was upgraded to a junior suite it was big but very small balcony.  The room itself was clean but there were parts of it overlooked and could have been cleaned. I'm not sure if I would stay again my overall experience was a 6 out of 10 . I think there are nicer places for the same price
"Good location, room and service..."
Easy access to beach and nearby to Kuta attraction.
lots of options throughout the local area.
"good location... at kuta beach,"
"when we were there, they were renovating different tower, so sad to see behind the curtain of our room there were filled with moles. food is alright"
"Overall the location, facilities and staff were good. Probably the staff need to be slightly friendlier? Do not get me wrong. They are friendly in general but they could do better especially when I asked for assistance on some things. Or maybe I am just too used to having very friendly hotel staff especially in Bali. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my staff here."
Lgs depan pantai kuta
The hotel is across the street from Kuta beach and only about 5 mins walk to the beachwalk mall. We walked all the way to Seminyak along the beach and took us about 30mins but obviously it didn’t feel like it! We got the room with king size bed by the pool. The room was not as clean as we would like but it was good for a short stay but won’t recommend for a long stay.
"I stayed 4 nights and the hotel was ok , not very exclusive, they might has just started the operation after pandemic , so few things needed to be updraged, such as cleaness, and few facilities."
"The hotel is still under construction, the room especially the bathroom seems dirty and old fashion, less estetic"
"Nice Location and Clean Hotel,Bed was comfy and room was spacious."
access to the local area
"Right in front of Kuta beach, value for money, not the best place to stay with childern, hard bed"
"The room smell really bad, the floor is dirty, the sheet is dirty and smell bad too, fix the door to the balcony, i don’t think it safe at night because you have connected balcony to the next room. Fix the shower, the hallway is low light and creepy."
"I would say it wasn't my best stay as there are many rooms for improvements. From air conditioning (coolness), hot water, up to room/furniture overall smell. Nothing fell short on the staff service as they were great. I truly hope for much improvements up ahead"
"Love the service, they provides water during stay. However, the room we stayed in needs some TLC. The shower head was old, the water came out unevenly and made it harder to shower, called the front desk, engineer came but he said they did not have the part to change and they would change it the next day, but never did. AC units was dripping water, condensation. He fixed and np after that. Restroom sink was stinky with no proper cover, just big holes. 
Love the people who work there. Very friendly and greeted us every time they saw us."
Nice budget friendly hotel.. one side was under construction. But the rooms good.
Great location. The room is good
Right by the beach
Very old hotel. Need major update. If the price below 600.000 rupiah per night then its worth it. Otherwise find a better hotel. The room was dirty especially the floor. The only good thing is it is right across from kuta beach.
"The pictures do not represent the state of hotel, there is a new section they are preparing and I think they stopped maintaining the old section a long time ago. Staff are very friendly, but there is only so much you can do when management stop investing in the hotel. Carpets are worn, paint peeling everywhere, damp in walls, tiles old and worn. Rooms poorly lit and wifi the worst, keeps dropping out every few minutes ...I could go on but would suggest go elsewhere  if you not in the new section. Sadly not up to  Wyndham brand expectation."
"We didn't sleep the two nights we stayed there and didn't know why.  As we were packing up to leave, we found the back of the curtains were covered with black mold.  We told the front desk and they told us to email management.  We did and got no response.   We sent messages in Agoda, no response.  It could have been a nice place to stay..."
"Front appears nice but back is a bunch of old apt complexes in that were combined to make a “hotel”.  Double triple verify location of your room. False advertising also, because the picture on the go to website is not the hotel you stay in. You actually stay in this place called the “garden” which is an old apartment building and looks nothing like the picture you see on the webpage."
Place was so dirty! Staff was great but the place I will never stay again only because it was dirty made me feel a little uncomfortable.
"Hotel very very old. They gave us a dirty room, the floor were very sticky and dusty. The view of the room also very bad. The hotel was nit crowded yet they gave us a very bad room wayyy back at the hotel with a very bad view of parking cars and walls. We complaint and the next day they d3cided to switch us to a beach front view which very nice view, but still the room was dirty. Dont know what the housekeeping is doing at the hotel. We only stayed there because it is right across from kuta beach and the price was fairly cheap around 600.000 rupiah. If the price was above 1 million rupiah it is not worth it. We stayed there basically only for its location"
But way too noisy. Do not bother buying breakfast. Not worth the money.
"Deluxe rooms are on back side of building Which is not clean enough . Executive rooms are on front side of building facing beach . I will
Not stay here again as feels unhygienic overall 
The strong point is location opp beach 
 Hotel organized nice new year party ."
"We checked in quite late. The room was not well cleaned especially in the bathroom. Aircon was not working properly so we requested to be fixed. Since it could not be fixed then we asked to move to another room. The replacement room had an aircon problem as well. So both of us could not sleep. Lucky we only stayed there for 1 night.
Location wise it is perfect."
"This hotel very narcism. When u're come from non Indonesian, you can get building A which view is sea view. But when you're Indonesian peoples you can placed at B building with travel tourists. In B building there's no security with poor view and old stuff placed. I will never go back to this hotel. NEVER!!!"
"I reserved a room for one night due to having an early morning flight and wanting to shower and rest before flying out while being close to the airport. The walls in the room were dirty, the wallpaper was peeling, the towels were all dirty, the toilet was disgusting, the remote for both the tv and AC were disgusting and saturated with stickiness, and to top it off there was no knob in the shower making it useless. Because I was only in the room for a few hours I bathed utilizing the water from the sink and my own towels that luckily I had with me. It also advertised that there was an airport shuttle but when I asked the front desk told me his friend would take me for 150,000 rupiah. The advertisement is very misleading and I felt dirty just being there."
The hotel is under renovation. Parking area is far away from lobby. Trainee staffs are nice and polite but other staff is not friendly
"There are 2 buildings of the Hotel and they allocated room to us in old backside unit. Door locks were crazy never worked in the first attempt. Wifi was just for the name never worked even after reporting to the authorities.  Breakfast is not vegetarian-friendly. 
Hard water damaging to hair and eyes. 
Stay away from this Hotel."
Need more effort to get parking lot because you must enter very narrow lane
Room was dirty and the air conditional was not working.
"stains all over the bed sheets, bathroom stinks an shower water smells and extremely salty. Safe box was broken, you could open it with a simple screw driver."
"1. Low Maintenance 
2. Low Quality of Service"
"Do Not trust the photoes, this hotel has been closed for 2yrs and just opened. The room is super dirty, shower and toilet is nightmare. My kids said, this hotel room is like prison. Exact expression. The door handle and shower tap is crashed and rusted!   I couldn't get refund after check in, so I moved to next hotel with another payment."
"This place is outdated, we had 7 rooms and all had problems. Either keycard machine is not working, AC not working, no water on sink, sticky floors,  sticky sheets, food is meh, drinks are even meh-er, pool is sketchy at best. All in all it was a horrible experience, please do yourself a favor and stay away. Also a tip—call or message hotels prior to staying somewhere new to ask about construction work done on property during time of visit."
"The Wyndham Garden Kuta Beach was well-located, and we had a great time exploring the vicinity's restaurants and shops. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We especially enjoyed the open outdoor lounge area and breakfast at the cafe. The view of the sunrise from the roof and ocean just across the way was lovely. The room itself was comfortable and clean. Unfortunately, there was some construction going on, so that got a bit noisy at around 8am and throughout the day. The swimming pools looked nice, but we didn't use them."
"Had a pleasant stay at Wyndham Garden Kuta. The staffs were very accommodating and room was comfy enough. On one of the day of our stay, we had to leave at 3.30am to catch the sunrise at Lovina and the hotel was very nice to pack us our breakfast box. I must say that I was very impressed with the breakfast box - was full for the day. 
If it weren't for the renovations I would have given Wyndham a 5-star for its value for money. But hey, its good that they're improving. Thank you for the pleasant hospitality Wyndham Garden Kuta!"
"Whyndam is a quite new hotel. Opposite Kuta beach. You have just to walk very little to reach the beach. 
The food was good. The staffs were nice and helpful. 
I booked twice. But each for only one day. First stay, my room bathroom door could not be locked since the lock was broken. 
The second stay also the same. But the lock was broken.  So maybe you can do a little check in advance to make sure everything work well before you enter the room. 
For transportation, you can rent motorbike across the street. They have one day rental basis. Meanwhile to reach to the airport, you can ask help from the rece"
"We stayed at the Wyndham Resort for 5 nights and would definitely stay again. The staff were fantastic and very accommodating. We had the poolside room over looking the beach. Rooms were clean and location was perfect. 
Didn't have the breakfast, but plenty of cafes and warungs to choose from."
"Will stay here again next time. Rooms were great and nice, clean, and the location of hotel is right opposite the beach. Staff were super friendly. Service was extremely efficient. Even after checking out a few days ago for Lembongan, they still allowed us to leave our baggage there when we came back from Lembongan. Made our last day in Kuta so much more convenient. Perfect choice!"
The ac of the room was not working and I had to change my room thrice during the stay the quality of the room was poor the biggest advantage is the location as the hotel is just opening on the Kuta beach guests can relax on the beach 🏖 whole day
"We stayed 2 days, a lovely hotel on the main beach road , we had the ocean view suite which had an amazing view, room was clean and bed was comfy, all the staffs were amazing, this is became my favorite spot in Kuta ... highly recommended."
Front desk is very helpful and knowledgeable about Bali. The SPA has a great view of the ocean and the room which opened to the pool made the stay wonderful. Just cross the street and you are on the beach. There is a convenience store to the right of the hotel
"+ bathroom, swimmingpool, room clean
+ staffs helpful
+ just few walks to Kuta Beach
+ welcome drink as complimentary
+ easy check-in & check-out
+ TV, AC, hot water well functioned
+ motorbike rental just in the front of the hotel
+ free concierge
+ close to mall
- still renovating area, so little bit uncomfy.
will stay here next time."
"Positive side :
1. staffs were very friendly
2. good location on the kuta beach road
3. breakfast was tasty
4. Check-out was fast and easy
5. Good room ammenities 
Negative sides:
1.  Lobby is too small and not AC-ed
2. Room floor is dusty
3. Swimming pool closed on the evening and very small.
4. Door leaf needs to be slammed when closing, otherwise it will be beeping. That's why if you are light sleeper you will be annoyed. Complaint of the beeping, resolved in two calls
4. Takeaway breakfast is not worth-it. not a standard of 4 star.
5. Bed is tough, had a neckache
6. Construction work happen on-site so the noise and view is not the best
7. Weekend music band is so loud better avoid the building #1
8. If you book via agoda, hotel won't provide receipt
9. Breakfast protein is not egg and chicken. Need more variety. The salad station has lots of tiny flies and it gross me. The only good about breakfast is that it tastes good.
10. Book for two rooms but prepared only for one room, so wait for it longer. The front desk need to be more detail attention."
"This is our second time staying here, previously was The Kuta Playa hotel.
Staff were very friendly and helpful, great location only across the road to the beach. The food was nice. Definitely will come back next time. :)"
"It's our 3rd time staying here and i love this place because of the staff, they are very sweet and friendly. Rooms are very clean, very near to the beach and few mins walk to Beachwalk. I will definitely stay here for the future vacay in Bali.."
Love this hotel. The hotel restaurant area is the coziest  place to chill and hang out after a tiring day exploring Bali.  The rooms look modern and new. Pool area is good too. Will come back to this hotel when I visit Bali again.
"The hotel is located in front of Beach, very good if you want to walk around Kuta and Legian area."
"Hotel and staff exceptional and really enjoyed our stay. Wouldn’t even know that renovations next door are going on and wasn’t disturbed by noise.  Very comfortable rooms. Opposite the hotel was the surfing only section of the beach however only a kilometre walk down to the swimming beach.
Downside on the hotel was housekeeping, they would forget towels, forget to put in toilet paper, bottles of water and other amenities and would be forever ringing housekeeping to supply what they didn’t put in the room at the time of cleaning."
"Wyndham Garden's is undergoing renovations at the moment, so it's probably not up to its normal standard, however, the food and the staff make up for any inconvenience the renovations involved."
Property is very well located exactly on Kuta Beach with lot of activities & Restaurants' around ...but don't book it with Agoda as for booking with Agoda the rooms you will get will be non preferred ones with no view at all.....
"The rooms behind the main building are still under construction. But we could not hear noises in the room. Two swimming pool. Staff are friendly and great. Complimentary late check out until 1 pm. 

Kuta beach is quite dirty. If I come back, might stay in semiyak instead."
"The hotel is located conveniently in Kuta area. Very easy access to the beach and also surrounding cafes, shops, etc. However, the construction is still ongoing in the next door making it less enjoyable to be staying there. Room is spacious with okay cleanliness. Although it's a pretty new hotel, however, some parts of the building already show signs of wear and tear. This is what happens when you use cheap materials to build with."
"location is very nice, only across kuta beach. easy access to anywhere, but only the traffic around kuta area which is very common."
Awesome place to stay
Value form money and location..
"190° different from the photos you see on website, so dirty, smells and not well maintained at all just stay away"
Location across just a few step to Kuta Beach.
Mantap
Top bgt.........
"Staff are very accommodating and will attend to your concerns.
Location is good and is near to the beach, mall, groceries.
Though, there are sections of the hotel that do not have roof and if it rains hard (Feb month is rainy), you need an umbrella and be a little wet when crossing to your room.
Otherwise, the stay is nice and recommendable!"
"it located in front of Kuta Beach, you can watch sunset from your room balcony, the room was nice, a little  bit old but they already renovated in some place. Would stay here again next time"
"Location is just a thrown of rock away from Kuta Beach. The room is big and clean, although there is some part of the hotel is under maintenance the beauty of the hotel is there. The staff  is very welcoming and accommodating. Need to improve the breakfast variety of food. But all is a memorable Bali trip for us."
Nth like the picture
"The hotel is extremely rundown and is in need of a major upgrade.  (Major as in, even pillows needed changing)"
Best! must stay here! near SPA and shopping mall! for relax and fully rest personnel
"Overall, this is a great place to stay. The location is good. You're on the doorstep of Kuta Beach but just on the edge of the busiest areas. It's loudish at night.
When we checked in (late night), the floor of the room was wet and holding a lot of moisture. I thought it was because of the humidity of Bali, but it persisted to an extent that I felt something more was wrong. We changed rooms the following morning to one adjacent to our original. Still the same problem was evident. The floors were wet, even when toweled down, the room was damp, the bedding was damp and this major issue had the potential to ruin our holiday. Anyway, we mentioned this to the staff on our second morning. We were dreading the worst throughout that day....
Upon our return, the room had been transformed! Apparently, there was a leak under the floor which was rectified on that day. No more dampness. We were very happy.
From then on, our stay was great. 
As for the rest of our stay.  The staff are attentive and quick to respond to requests. The hotel is in a great location if somewhat noisy! There are two pools. Our room was okay with a relatively small balcony facing the ocean. If I'd have been more aware, I may have chosen a 'by the pool suite' which are located on the ground floor and look newly built. 
Some of the hotel is under renovation. One of the two lifts were out of order for our entire stay and of course the leak under the floor. 
Overall, I'd recommend this hotel. It's equidistant to the hustle and bustle of Kuta Beach and the hustle and bustle of Legian!"
"Great hotel for stay in Kuta, just walk across the street to the beach, near to Mall, and food and attraction. The staff very fast respond. 
I was stay for a night, they fast respond when i ask why the ac at my room is not cool, they move us to another room an hour after we call them. We will choose this hotel again in next trip. Thank you"
"The staff were all warm and accommodating. They provided pretty much everything we requested - more toiletries, new towels, cutleries, and most importantly, early check-in (10am) & late check-out (2pm).
The hotel itself somehow looked like it had been ghosted for quite some time due to pandemic; so some parts of the hotel, such as the corridors, looked gloomy. But it is currently being renovated - I hope they also improve the appearance overall.
The room itself is just fine, not much trace of the pandemic. And the bed was really soft, I could sleep there forever. In summary, there are areas for improvement but our stay there was still, really comfortable and it felt like home away from home."
Thanks Wyndham 🙏🏼
Everything was great.. just a size of room are too small..
