I’d heard hit and miss reviews but we were so impressed. For the price - the hotel was everything you need! Great location and accommodation and amazing pool. The breakfast is basic but honestly - such good bang for buck!
Great place to stay … very accessible to all restaurants and shopping shops and money changer around the area … beach front is very nice place and clean ..
Have stayed here 3 times and have found it to be a great resort. Yes it’s old but it’s very comfortable and very close to everything you need
"The staff was great and the room was clean.  It's an older resort, but it served its purpose. It's close to everything and right by the beach. I would go back again."
"Hotel was well located, staff were friendly and very helpful, rooms were basic but clean and comfortable. Was a great budget alternative. Hotel pool is great and right on the beach."
"Amazing location in Legian, literally across from the beach, a circle k across the road and walking distance to great restaurants. Jayakarta served a nice buffet breakfast, specifically the omelettes and waffles. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Pools were clean although the sun lounges weren’t the most comfortable. We booked an apartment and the room was clean but could do with some sprucing up. Aircon worked well. We found the bed hard at first but got used to it. Pool towels need to be be collected and returned to the hut. We brought the pool towels back to our room and they weren’t picked up for 3 days which was inconvenient, so we got the hint and had to bring them back to the hut."
"We love the jayakata hotel  location and pools are great  . Restaurants just close by !
 We were 2 couples in our early  sixties 
Beach out front for  sunset and beach swims"
"Missing a few things such as hair dryer and adapter, was disappointing that pool bar was not in operation however understandable due to COVID-19 and hotel not at capacity. Very clean. Excellent location. Would have liked the safety deposit box to be in our room. Also water not very hot. But not too much of a drama due to the warm weather.  Staff always friendly.  Will definitely stay again."
"Was a little disappointed that the first room we were given didn't accommodate our request for a double bed. However, staff managed to find us a room with a double bed.  Our bathroom tap was leaking (I reported it, but I don't think it was ever fixed). 
Breakfast food was good, staff were very friendly.  Excellent location with the beach right outside and good restaurants close by.
Bali is slowly coming  back to life after Covid and not having visitors. Please be mindful of that and follow their requirements for mask wearing, showing vaccination status as if you were in your own country."
Hotel rooms are old but clean and functional. Staff are very helpful. Grounds of hotel and pool is lovely. Breakfast is excellent. Would recommend this hotel to stay in Bali.
Jayakarta Bali Beach resort was fantastic. Great location. Staff were very helpful. The facilities were great. Buffet breakfast is a must!
"The Jayakarta is in the perfect location - close to shopping, great restaurants and beach. The rooms are a little tired and could do with a make over. The buffet breakfast is ok - maybe a bit of a change would be good. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Overall a great place to stay when you get it for a good deal!"
Always stay here! We always get the buffet breaky option it helps save some money and options are great! Easy to get anything you’d need.
"This was a great hotel! On the beach, clean pools and rooms. Buffet breakfast was great and staff couldn’t do enough for you! Would def go again."
"Staff is all very kind and helpful, location is excellent"
"The 3 pools are amazing... the breakfast is well worth it, they make the best vegetable omelet. Location just across from the beach."
"we were able to snag a great deal through Agoda to stay at this lovely resort that is in a great location, spread out with lovely gardens and 4 lovely pools to choose from and with the beach just across the road I would say this is perfect."
Great location and everything you could need
Fabulous staff and location
"We loved The Jayakarta Hotel. We had interconnecting rooms which was perfect for our family. The staff were so friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. The rooms could do with a spruce up but they are practical and cleaned daily. The location is perfect, right on the beach for sunset and plenty of nice restaurants and shopping within walking distance."
"The hotel is a bit old, but the location is very good ( Infront of the beach). In the past this was a legendary place to stay. It still has the balinese flaire and reminds me of Bali 20 years ago."
Clean good. Sarapan diperbanyak dong.
"We have stayed at the Jayakarta several times now and the staff are great.
This hotel is on the beach and there are great restaurants and bars out the front not to mention shops and Eden green spa.
This is a typical Balinese hotel."
Nice pool and breakfast
I really had a good time and enjoyed this hotel recommended
"We loved the extensive grounds with palm trees and all kinds of flowering trees, the majestic entryway was an example of impressive teak wood architecture, and the staff were very helpful and kind. 
The pool was a bit high in chlorine, but there are several and very nice if you are not sensitive. Plenty of lounges by the pools. We had a standard room - which seems to be older rooms. It was clean, comfortable and we had a view of the sea through the trees. However, if you book a deluxe, which we looked at, they are very beautiful, modern with a balcony and face gardens! 
The hotel is directly across from a long flat beach, awesome
For morning strolls and there are many great restaurants  nearby.  I would stay here again, and try to book early to get a deal on a deluxe room! 
The breakfast was good, generous tea & coffee, eggs to choice, sausages, pancakes, cornflakes, a variety of breads and some sweet rolls, my favorite-papaya, pineapple & watermelon, a salad bar, and you can ask for more if it’s low, and a few Asian dishes like fried rice, fried noodles, and sometimes fried potatoes, or roasted tomatoes etc."
Great location and amazing  staff
"Great hotel, fantastic location on the beachfront. Rooms well appointed and friendly staff"
"Older resort in great location. Rooms a little tired and basic. Good breakfast. Staff need a small rev up, slow to respond to requests."
"The hotel is old and could do with a good upgrade but for what you pay and for it to be right on the beach, you can't complain.  We were unhappy with a few things about the room they put us in (like I said, it's old) but they went out of their way to find us a room which we were happy with.  The staff were very friendly.  The hotel has the beach to the back of it and a whole array of shops, bars, restaurants to the front.  Perfect location.  Note - they don't provide safes or hairdryers in your room."
"Feels like home doesn't change great pools staff are always helpful and friendly, right on the beach if you are looking for luxury  this isn't for you."
Lovely gardens and facilities....rooms a little dated but good value! Perfect Location.
"Everything well and nice 👍
But need to review fitness center since maybe long time not used so need to refurbish 🙏
Thank you"
Love this place
Can’t find anything to complain about.  Loved loved loved
Absolutely amazing stay! They were great from start to finish especially with free upgrade. The staff were funny and light hearted and made us feel very welcome. This is the best place to stay for true Bali resort experience at an affordable price! Thank you xx
"This is a great place, limited drink options and quiet. Hopefully it will be back to normal soon."
"Lovely gardens and great location, enjoyed beautiful morning walks on the beach and swimming in the pools. Staff helpful and friendly  from reception to money changing staff. Recommend the gift shop as well run by lovely brother and sister.  Only thing not fixed was phone in our room.  All in all great place just a bit too busy for us."
"As the title suggested and there are plenty of restaurants, massage parlour, mini mart & laundry within walking distance from both front & beach entries. Optional rental of bean bags from various local beach outlet operators, chasing Bintangs/cocktails and catching  the Bali sunsets. Downsides are the staff do not enforce rules on lounge chair hogging, glass bottle around & in the pool and smoking in the pool...without an ashtray!! Dated residence, to be expected and mediocre breakfast 6/10."
"The hotel has three lovely swimming pools. It is just across the road from the beach and is well laid out. Breakfast is good.  
However, there were mosquitos on the first night; the requested spraying on the second day got rid of these and left some cockroaches dead on the floor.  A request for a larger bed to suit my size resulted, at my pointing this out, in two single beds pushed not very successfully together.
The hotel, like many in Bali, is recovering from the pandemic, but I would not return there."
Verry good servis
"Great pools, good location, great breakfast"
"Great value for money, however it is really all about the location, right on the beach.  Some rooms are a little tired.  Suggest you approve your room before you physically check-in.  Otherwise, book and enjoy."
"Have stayed at Jayakarta on many occasions.love the location and staff of this hotel.Breakfast is excellent.Unfortunately at the moment a few negatives are appearing,spacious grounds are not being maintained as previous, rooms need a drastic upgrade are looking very tired,even though are very clean . WiFi is terrible, televisions are old."
a little old and dated but for the price i think its satisfactory. great breakfast selection.
"I stayed here for a week the location is amazing right in the heart of Legian, any issues are resolved quickly and staff are very friendly and understanding and want you to be happy with your stay, I would definitely recommend this resort to family and friends and I'll be back again for sure."
Building is starting to show signs of age but everything is clean and comfortable.
"Best ever bro; pool side bar, order in brides, hawkers at door step. Big pools, plenty brogans. Luv it here bro"
"hotel is right at beach which is the only reason to choose it. the hotel itself has aged & needs upgrade. for the price, there are better options in the area. the staff are friendly and doing their best to help. the aircond works fine but there shower water has distinct smell. the room towels also smell bad. please do something about it. the spa is decent. overall ok but there are better alternatives."
Great place with friendly helpful staff and good location
"I am a group traveller of 4. 2 coming from Malaysia and me and my hubby are local tourist 
At first, I feel so unsure about this hotel as I know the hotel is an old one and lots of bad review of the hotel condition
Found out later that it is old but consider okay. The bathroom and bedroom is clean, Pool area are superb with tasty breakfast
The only concern is we can hear noisy up above our room and its so annoying. Other than that, this hotel is just perfect
Value for your money. Definitely will gone back to The Jayakarta Legian"
Staying at the Jayakarta was excellent. Staff and Service Perfect/Location and Amenities Perfect. Only Downside - Rooms are Dated and the Breakfast Menu did not vary once in the fourteen days that we were there. Otherwise Fantastic Hotel offering great value for money.
Great hotel for the price and location
"Easy walking distance to some great places for dinner, massage and shopping. Great cocktails at the swim up bar. Friendly staff."
"Great location, great pools and right on the beach. Older style hotel but has everything you need and the other travellers were great too"
Gardens are a delight with 3 lovely pools food good especially buffet breakfast
"There’s only one thing I can fault the Jayakarta, that’s the wifi connection.
Everything from the pools, food, cocktails, staff and rooms is beyond perfection:)"
"Awsome location on the beach, great pools, lovely breakfast, rooms are pretty old but fine, bed was comfortable"
"Great location at beach
Great discount 
Upgraded to delux because honeymoon 
Staff great 👍 
Food good quality"
Disappointed the the sunset bar was not open . I think that the kids play area needs updating . But overall was happy with the hotel
"Nice hotel great pool , best location!"
"Great hotel, a little old now but all functional etc opposite beach and plenty of restaurants and bars: good staff; breakfast not buffet yet but hopefully soon. Highly recommend"
"Make sure you book a deluxe room or better. Some of the standard rooms are old and need renovation.  The staff are wonderful.  Service is great. Location is good. This is a large hotel with big gardens, lots of Australians. Lots of families."
"Great for the budget conscious , walking distance to Garlic lane and so close to many bars & restaurants. Its  situated on the beach which is awesome.  The hotel itself is a little tired but value for money , especially when booking through agoda. The staff were fantastic."
"staff were amazing extremely friendly and help full
location was fantastic right on nice beach close to shops and restaurants
huge pool . gardens were beautiful 
good place to stay but the hotel was looking a little old in parts
in all i would be happy tu stay there again"
Perfect location but didn't appreciate house keeping at 8.30am.
"The room was a bit tired and bathroom a little dated.  Seemed to be a shortage of pool towels, however good food, and very good value.
the gym is in a bad state and needs all equipment, fixed or replaced."
"Don’t expect the world here, rooms are comfortable but location and facilities are really good, value for money, will stay again"
"I got a special deal which was fantastic, with the roomy set up, the big pools and the 50 meter walk to the beach. I am not sure though if it would be worth the walk in price. The cabins were simple. When my door lock didn't work it took too long for them to fix it. Internet just so-so. Also breakfast buffet was more focussed on Australians and didn't have many European (bread, cheese, pate) or Asian choices."
It’s great location but it is looking run down and the first room we were offered was terrible it smelled bad . I went back to reception and asked for better and we got room 218 with a nice view of the ocean . 👍
"Nice pool across Rd from beach with a nice breeze flowing. Rooms r  Bali style nothing flash, bed comfy and good wifi. Great kids pool, and lots of Aussies around felt at home here. Def would stay again. Price with breakfast was very reasonable."
The resort is reasonably priced and in a great location. The price of food and drinks within was a bit overpriced
The back gate is on the beach and lots of great restaurants nearby. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Three lovely pools. Rooms in need of a little refurbishment but good for the price.
Pool was awesome breakfast was great .location perfect right next to the beach
"Hello all, just got back home and whilst it is fresh I will let you guys know,
Good spot, walking distance to a lot of Warungs and restaurants also shopping.
Staff are very good that's what you expect, yes! and value for money considering it is a resort style accom.
Ours was a brief stay however very enjoyable pools and pool bar was great.
An older style of resort but maintained pretty well considering it's age, would return without even thinking to hard about it.
I hope this has helped enjoy I love Bali."
"We have stayed at the Jayakarta on 2 occasions and the location is excellent. The grounds are lovely and well cared for and the pools are great. Unfortunately the rooms are quite tired and some 'Standard' rooms are well below standard. We had to upgrade last time to get a decent room , this also had some plumbing issues that left a very bad smell every evening. This was reported three times , it was fixed but kept coming back.
The Staff are fantastic and trained to a high standard.
The Gym not a good standard and equipment unsafe.
Overall good value for money."
While facility is still enjoyable it is in need of urgent upgrade. Rooms need own safes and bathrooms need seperate shower. Remove bath and have shower only in the rooms.
"Right on Legian beach
Huge pool facilities 
Good staff
Expensive for age of hotel but ok
Breakfast good not great
Overall good experience"
"The Jayakarta Hotel is attractive in it's Balinese style although it is showing it's age. It is in need of a refurbishment with lots of broken tiles inside the bedrooms and bathrooms, also outside around the gardens. These problems are not due to Covid shutdown, it is lack of input before then from the Hotel management. I would go there again knowing what to expect, the good outweighed the bad. Staff were lovely."
"Even though some rooms are not clean enough, staffs are very helpful to change the rooms and satisfied. Thank you for help while staying"
"Fantastic location staff are amazing grounds are stunning, rooms are a little dated would be my only negative"
"We love this place, but the rooms are a little expensive for what you get."
"like mosquitos, bugs and roaches…  but staffs are wonderful. Breakfast was ok.  I will stay again."
"rooms are outdated, but spacious garden with swimming pool direct at the beach"
Small room. Good location. Good pool and restaurant. Waiting staff were great. Staff at desk weren’t helpful - complained about the room - people next to us partying loudly at midnight.
"While our stay was comfortable, the rooms were very old and the beds were quite hard. We had a 1 bedroom apartment near the front of the hotel and we found it very loud from the bars until the early hours. Although the hotel has no control of this it did make it difficult for our kids to sleep. 
We found the staff to be quite, not really acknowledging us unless we initiated the conversation. The pool bar staff were great but the rest of the hotel was missing the warm and friendly vibe we are so used to in Bali. 
Biggest draw card for this hotel is the location, right in the beach and within walking distance to plenty of great restaurants. Not a bad price but feel you could find better."
"Smells like mould in the room, it’s a very old hotel. Very dark in rooms at night as there’s only 2lamps and two gpo. Our room service phone did not work, so we had to walk to reception for orders. We reported this to staff but it never got repaired., even the chairs out on balcony are deteriorating and leave white marks on your clothes. Don’t want to sound like I’m whinging to much but rat ran on to my balcony to eat some leftover chips. Anyway some positives staff where really nice and it’s a Great location ,connects on to the beach and to the shops."
"Hotel accommodation was not good. Bed was broken and AC was also not working properly. Breakfast buffet was so budgeted with basic celerals and no options for vegetarians or vegans. Breads were contain egg and they didn’t mentioned for people who have allergic to egg. We asked for vegetarian options with no egg. They provided us pancakes and waffles for 6 days. So, overall it was quite budgeted facilities. 
Good thing was staff was very nice."
"This place is old. Treated myself to a suite and it was the oldest wing, furthest from the pool, dark, no view, decrepit tiny balcony, miserable. They moved me to a newer, smaller, cheaper room (no compensation!), which is comfortable enough. Nice pool"
"When we arrived we were told the room we booked was unavailable (even though I confirmed everything was good three days prior via email) until the following day and that they ""upgraded"" us to an apartment.  The so called upgrade was as far at the back of the complex as you could go, it smelt awful burning my nose and throat, the toilet didn't flush, the balcony over looked some drains, the lift didn't work and the whole area leading to the room felt unsafe with not a single person or staff member in sight.  After much complaining about the room and being told adamantly and quite rudely they were fully booked, we were going to try and find alternative accommodation.  Suddenly they found a room with a pool view for us and that we could remain in that room for our entire stay.  Although a huge improvement on the apartment, the rooms are still very basic and tired looking, but generally clean enough.
Most of the staff are friendly enough, with the exception of the staff where you check in, but could do with some customer service training.  The grounds are nice enough and you could generally get a spot poolside.  The buffet breakfast was average with not a whole lot of variety and. was exactly the same every single day.   The location was okay although quite a bit of a walk to either Kuta or Seminyak.  The bars at the beach also closed very early and you had to walk to the areas either side if you wanted to stay longer.
Would I stay again, probably not unless I only booked a pool view room.  I definitely would not recommend an apartment."
"An excellent exciting location with great facilities; large pool, restaurants and gym. Anything on request; great place highly recommended"
The pool area is the most dangerous pool area I have ever seen. When wet the tiles are deadly I seen so many kids slip over and hurt themselves and adults its really dangerous and its a daily occurrence.
"Tired needs an upgrade, but location is good and staff are good.  The gym is dirty and an occupational health hazzard.  Air con didn't work and is very hot.  Equipment is limited."
The resort is old basic accomodation . Clean great location . Gym not open quiet resort.
"As it is an old place , the quality of your surroundings is poor. It' clean and functional but for the price you pay in Bali, this is below standard. Also at the time of my holiday, end of the year, it's far too crowded. The weather didn't help! Would I return to Legian? No. Sanur is more appealing, quieter and the beach is more attractive and clean."
"I always stay here, it’s on beach, close to restaurants and activities for all. Slightly dated rooms but ok. Pools are great."
A great hotel for the budget conscious traveller. A little tired but a good location and value for money
"Great location, friendly staff. Hotel is a little run down. Needs new painting in room. Bathroom need to be renovated and cleaned up. Was some mould around in bathroom."
Rooms need to be updated
The beach out the front is dirty. Drinks where overpriced. Location is good but the rooms are outdated.
"It began with check in. I arrived and tried to check in with my ID and booking number. They'd lost my reservation. This went along through four people unable to say anything other than ""You don't have a booking"" which I clearly did, until a fifth came and said that their system showed my booking cancelled. I showed them the email and app confirming my booking, and the charge in my credit card paying for two rooms. The woman said I could book two more rooms. At a higher price than I'd originally paid. I declined showing that I'd already paid. She disappeared for 10 minutes returning with a printout, which to me showed that their system had erred, not me or Agoda. I was told to contact Agoda, which I did. The app was quick and helpful at calling the resort. Agoda agents got back to me straight away saying they would sort it because I had paid and they'd put in my booking, but it would take 30 minutes or so. The resort staff continued to do nothing to help sort out the situation. After 30 minutes it was sorted, with the resort offering nothing for the hassle.
The rooms, at the back of the resort, for which we'd paid extra for an upgrade, were dirty, with trays of plates covered with old food stacked at the end of the hallways. The phones did not work. The WiFi in the rooms did not work. And the elevators were out for a day with no explanation. When these issues were brought to hotel staff attention, nothing (that I am aware of) was done to fix any.
Not the first time I stayed there, as the pool and location are admittedly great, but it will be the last."
"Grounds and pool area is amazing, some of the best pool facilities we have had in Bali. However the children’s playground and outdoor area has not been maintained and is not really usable which is disappointing as the rest of the grounds are amazingly well maintained, also the children’s indoor play area was not opened at all during our trip which was disappointing, this is apparently due to it still being too quiet however it is listed on the website and my 5 year old was looking forward to using all the facilities, thankfully he was happy to spend all his time in the pool.
Free Wi-fi is provided but you are regularly having to resign in.
The rooms are ok a bit dated but our room had good aircon, the lighting was only from the 3 lamps in the room making it very dim at night. Our room had a little patio area which my son loved to sit out and play on but the chairs out there are very flimsy and I wouldn’t trust sitting on one of them.
My parents who travelled with us had the same questionable chairs, we travelled with a group of others and it is a large hotel and everyone was spread out across the whole resort. 
Just something to be mindful of if you have children who are light sleepers (our son sleeps through anything but did note we are lucky he does otherwise he would have been woken up), The restaurant had loud music playing on a couple of nights that we could easily hear from our room which was at the other side of the hotel from the restaurant, it was always turned down well before midnight.
The team at the front desk did not provide a positive experience with a mix up in the booking not well handled. We have stayed in Bali multiple times and this was the worst check-in I have experienced and it was a struggle as the front desk member had limited English and was not competent. All the staff at the bar , porters, gardeners and housekeeping where incredibly friendly it was the service at the reception that really tainted my experience at the hotel.
Location wise"
We have been to the Jayakarta 7 times.  We find the location and staff fantastic. However the entire complex needs a fefresh. Each time we go there are fewer and fewer pool deck chairs. They need to invest some money into this prime location
"Excellent location and pools.
Very disappointed with food and drinks around the pool area- prices and quality. Rooms very clean and well serviced.   Fitness centre unusable, broken and dirty.  Breakfast average. Would not pay for if not included in rate."
"Great location but hotel needs a lot of TLC.  Rooms outdated and TV not working, air conditioner filter dirty, electrical wiring not working all lights.  Telephone in room not working.  No in room safe."
"Rooms have not been upgraded since I first stayed there in 2000. 
1st day there, walking next to pool, tiles extremely slippery, feet flew out from under me , went down very  hard. Bruised and sore all over, for the rest of my holiday. 
Location is great but that's about it for this place, stay somewhere cheaper and safer."
"Rooms were outdated by about 20 years
Pools were awesome, Staff were great. Food was yum"
"I go to Bali twice a year and this was my first time in this resort. I stayed here this time because my friends had already booked there. Prior to arrival I emailed asking if the mini bar could be removed from the fridge. My response was No, unless I purchased everything in the minibar. Absurd. Simple things just seemed too hard. For example, no iron or ironing board. I was told by reception I had to send items away and pay to be pressed. What resort doesn’t have an iron! 
I had the do not disturb sign up as I was in the shower. I hear a knock at the door and thinking it was my friends I opened the door dressed only in my towel. An employee asked “do you want your room cleaned today?” There was no announcement of housekeeping and the do not disturb sign was up. 
When cleaning the room they changed the sheets but did not restock the body wash. They do not provide body lotion. The food in the resort is sub standard compared to other resorts of a similar price range."
"This place looks amazing on paper but that's about where it ends. While the staff are incredibly friendly, and the pool is great, overall the place is a bit of a dump. The one bedroom apartments are near a nightclub blasting music until midnight. WiFi is incredibly slow and does not always work. It only worked in my living room and not in my bedroom. This place also does not have the classiest clientele.  I suspect half of these people would not even be let into a Trump rally. 
Bottom Line: Spend a little more for a place that actually has functioning wifi and guests who aren't completely covered in tattoos."
"Front desk staffs looks like they are not happy people are checking in, rude and un polite. We Arrived at past 10am and they told us that we don't have a booking even after we showed them our booking confirmation, we eventually asked them to double check and she found our booking. Told us that check in time is 2pm as the ""hotel is full"" even tho it wasn't, but we do understand it that the check in time was 2pm so we didnt complain, went to concierge to leave our bags instead but the guy there is nowhere to be found and waited 30mins for him, at 2pm we went back to the front desk to get our keys but told us that the room is not ready yet so we ended up waiting until 5pm to get our room key!!!! They could've just put us in a different room as like i said there were a lot of rooms available with the same category as what we booked!!! Pool area was the highlights as they have a swim up bar, very nice bar attendant, good music and they have small carts that sells street foods. Good location"
Site is old and needs updating
"Our room was full of bugs, bathroom was swarming with them, I understand that it’s a tropical place and it’s excepted but the bathroom was full of them and there was really poor water pressure as well"
"Although the location of this hotel is great, the reality is that it is very, very old and tired and needs a complete makeover. The pool areas are nice, but the rooms are old and tired.  The foyer too is incredibly old and dated and needs a full refurbishment. The buffet breakfast is fairly basic and ok quality. That said, it is a cheap place to stay so all up reasonable value for money - but you do get what you pay for."
"This hotel is MUCH worse than the pictures indicate.   The hotel is from the 1980s and NOTHING has been updated since.    I had to see 4 rooms before I found one even remotely descent.   The toilet seats are falling apart, the fixtures are rusty and the rooms are in a state of disrepair.   The pool is nice, there's no question about that.    
I feel sorry for the staff - they are so nice and are frustrated themselves with all the customer complaints.   Some customers had MOLD in their rooms.
The WiFi is SO SLOW it's no usable.   
If you are going to book this property, I URGE you to not book for more than 3 nights.   See it for yourself before you comitt.   
There are so many other properties to choose from...."
"Our stay at Jayakarta Hotel is disappointing.
1) Check-in experience - Staff was not efficient in assigning a room according to what we have booked. 
2) Room Upkeep - Rooms smells old/musky. It’s not well kept. Debris and dirt coming from the ceiling manhole would fall inside the bath tub from time to time. The room looks very much different from what we have seen in the photos.
3) Amenities - No hair dryer; no lampshades; no bidet! During my 5-night stay, I was provided only with 1 small tube of bath gel. Even it is was already used up, housekeeping did not provide a replacement or a new set of toiletries. Coffee, sugar and cream were not replenished by housekeeping. 
4) Cleanliness - During check-in into the room, I noticed already the used teaspoon with remnants of coffee. I was expecting Housekeeping to check and clean it the following day but even after 2 days, the dirty/used teaspoon was still there. On my 3rd day, I called the attention of a staff and instead of getting the teaspoon and saucer with remnants of coffee washed, he just got a towel from his cart (not sure if the towel was clean) to wipe off the coffee remains from the teaspoon. He didn’t even wash it! The water kettle does not look clean with a lot of water calcification."
Room very dirty and old. Resort pools are very nice
Pools closed at 6 pm not idea as they put chlorine in and then reopen at 7 pm and was too strong on the eyes
"We were a little disappointed the rooms were in desperate need of repair, toilet wouldn’t stop running, beds were almost unbearable to sleep on and we had mice frequently visit us at night. The pools are amazing with plenty of lounge chairs and the location is quite central. 
I would say after an upgrade this place will be perfect to stay at."
"The best thing about this hotel is only the swimming pool. Room was old , linen and towels were yellow. Plastic chairs in the room are like 100 yo , the mattress on the swimming pool chairs were mouldy. Chairs at the restaurant have tape on them . Not good"
They close the pool at 6pm for an hour every day and pour chlorine. Why can’t this be done late at night or early morning like every other resort. Restaurant food was average and staff struggled to keep the breakfast buffet stocked most days.
