"We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights. Literally, we  didn't go out elsewhere so we could  enjoy the sun, pool, great food and best time with my husband. The rooms has no TV so that we have time to enjoy the beautiful view of nature!"
"We had a great stay at La Joya Biu Biu. Only got to stay a night and wished we had had 1-2 more. Views are gorgeous, pool is awesome and staff and service is great!  Comfy bed, unique stay. Great value for money.
Tips: book one of the stand alone bungalows and prebook the spa (down the Cliff!)"
"La Joya Biu Biu is a lovely hotel with a rustic feel and amazing views! The infinity pool(s) look out on the ocean and the sunset! It is pretty removed from other places, and they do not allow online taxis or ride services there, so you will need to pay the rates the local taxis have, so something to keep in mind. We only left once to go to the Uluwatu Temple and Kecak dance and just spent the rest of the time at the pool. There’s a beautiful cliff side spa as well. The food is pretty good too. It was just what we needed at the end of our trip!"
"Everything was extremely nice in the location!
But the stuff they don’t speak proper English so they couldn’t manage to help us and the food in the restaurant specially dinner time it was not that great!
Also whenever we were asking them for something they were kind of rude with us!"
"Brilliant to totally relax. Reasonable price. Great prices within this resort. No TV if you are into that.  Very  clean and amazing decor… everywhere. Perched on the edge of the cliffs so spectacular views. Not suitable for kids, definitely adults only type place. Highly highly recommended for pure relaxation."
"Amazing views, beautiful rooms, and above all else perfect customer service 😊 for the price, it is very very good and I would come back again ! Thank you for hosting our amazing stay in Bali :)"
We loved our stay at this hotel. They had multiple pools with great clog side views and a private beach! The food and drink were also great and we had great service. The rooms were huge and had plenty of amenities.
"Beautiful resort and stunning expansive  view of coast and sea.  The staff were super friendly and accommodating. Food was more on expensive side for Bali but good. 
The only thing that could make this place better was the music around pool area which was often loud and not conducive to relaxing and reading a book. And in saying that the bottom pool area had no music so you can  choose where you go."
"Value for money !
Worth the price with the view 😍😍😍
Bersih dan nyaman"
"It felt like a 5 star resort. We loved the infinity pools, cliff drop spa with windows overlooking the ocean, the table service for inclusive breakfast. 
Will stay again next visit!"
"I highly recommend staying at La Joya. All around pleasant experience. Friendly, hospitable, & attentive staff. The entire resort remains clean at all times. The food is affordable & delicious. Views and amenities are impeccable!"
"This is a very special  place indeed! From the beautiful Balinese bungalows and furnishings, to the amazing pools and spa, the restaurant and  the gorgeous  immaculately trained staff... everything about this place is pure beauty and class. Oh, and did I mention that view!!!!!!!  Omg!!!  Stay here if you can, you really won't regret a minute."
I booked La Joya Biu Biu for the last 2 days of the trip to Bali to just relax and chill. The property is located in an amazing place with an amazing view and restaurant. They have an amazing Spa on the property. The staff was so helpful
"If you're interested to calm and beautiful cliff scenery, this resort has it all. 
Direct view to the ocean from the cliff, private pass to private beach (only some step down away) and not so crowded places around it too
The resort is a bit far and small road to reach, but hey, your phone map will show you the way, the road is all good
The room is OK with a mezzanine which also has a weird shape bed just nice to stay for your kids
The wall is a bit not-so-soundproof though, so if you have a noisy neighborhood, you might heard some sound (but it still ok)"
"One of the most amazing places we have ever stayed, from the moment we walked in we were in absolute awe of how stunning this place is, it’s a place where you do not want to leave and miss a minute of what it has to offer"
"Most beautiful location, easy transport, staff are incredible. Yummy food and AMAZING few and facilities! Could not be more happy"
"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for a couple who want to relax. 
 
Pros: Great pools, one to lounge quietly, the other with music. 
The views! Amazing views of the ocean from the restaurant and pools. 
Private beach. Easily accessible beach that is never busy. 
Staff was accommodating - we arrived to discover some noisy construction near our assigned room. They moved us to an available unit farther away the next day. They even had construction paused for the one night we had to stay near it. 
Value - beautiful rooms and hotel grounds. 
Amazing ocean views!
Cons:
Location: About 25 mins from restaurant hub and other attractions.
Transport:  We recommend you rent a scooter for yourself. The hotel doesn’t shuttle people and the apps like Grab and GoJek don’t work well outside of the town hub. 
Food/ drink: restaurant is so-so. Average food options. Breakfast is included. We had a caesar salad that did t sit well with either of us. 
Definitely recommend!"
"Got to stay here with a good deal 😍😍 very impressed with the room, it was very fragrant even when I’m home my luggage still smell like the hotel room. The staff was friendly, the view surrounds the resort is amazing."
"you feel like in a movie or heaven.. im not really sure.. the view are breathtaking and gorgeous! definitely will come back, everything well thought carefully.. compliment!"
"We book ocean view lodge, and we looooove this room so much! Cant wait to go back!!! Yhis resort so beautifull, they have private beach, good food! Couldnt ask for more! 🌺🌺🥰🥰"
"This little place tucked away up near Uluwatu is beautiful. We stayed in the ocean view villa and it was well worth the extra money. Having the private pool (semi private … people can look in from the Instagram spot..) was lovely. Your own view out of the cliffs and beyond is lovely. The sound of the ocean was perfect for sleeping. Bed super comfortable (semi hard) - cleaned daily which was amazing. Breakfast was 4 options, could probably be a little more - but what they did was very well done and fresh. Breakfast starts at 8 which I think is a little late. Staff were amazing and very attentive. We Gojek’d from the villa everywhere which is super easy and cheap. Nice to be away from everything. Great place to escape to to really rewind and relax."
"Great hotel and view! Amazing staff and all very confortable and clean! 
It’s a postcard place to be at sunset hour! 
To repeat for sure!!"
"Enjoying our weekends here, eating pizza while watching sunset was nice"
"The rooms & the view was amazing, the staff very helpful, the foods are very delicious, will coming back again xx"
"Stunning resort, the view is incredible, just a few step from the beach. The hot shower works very well and the breakfast is great."
Superb location the food is really yummmm so is the stay ! Beautiful enjoyed a lot
"The stay really good with a really good view, and spa treatment is good, breakfast provided, and you can just chilling there"
Lovely view & very intimate setting. Loved the pools areas & restaurant was fine.
"Boutique Resort, offering everything you need to relax in a quiet part of Bali. Staff very helpful and way more enjoyable than the time we spent earlier at a larger scale resort."
We were only staying for one night and wished we could have stayed longer. Such a well managed and colourful hotel with beautiful views.The food was delicious and the restaurant had a stylish and relaxed ambiance. Would love to return one day. Highly recommended.
Nice view and had private beach. Overall my family was satisfied with this resort..👍👍
just go look at lajoya biu biu IG and you will love it
"Beautiful view and lushy gardens. Rooms where clean, quiet and whole place just breath relax. Had a really good dinner, pasta seafood and lava cake was good. Note for managment: Price for the wine was way to much.  Food n drink a bit to pricy. Breakfast could be better. But all and all very good. We will come back 4sure!"
It’s a beautiful resort with amazing pools and cliff view..the Balinese style rooms are another highlight.
This is objectively a lovely place to stay but maybe it just wasn’t quite what we were after. The views were incredible. Food catered to an international visitor. But perhaps felt more like staying at a day club with euro beats by the pool than a truly tranquil experience. Staff were friendly.
Will definately come back!
"Pemandangan nya bagus bgt, pokonya the best"
Bagus banget kamarnya
"i had honeymoon at this beautiful place. nice view, good spa, and also great taste of food.. i found everything good on this resort. highly recommended :)"
"Nice place for staycation or vacation. Nice pool view to the ocean. And can get access to the private Beach. 
And the Restaurant was so good taste."
"It’s an amazing place , beautiful views of landscapes and beautiful designed gardens, pools  and bungalows .  We liked it but it is very isolated . Maybe is worth staying a night or two . There is nothing around the area . Sometimes you get lucky to catch gojeck but not always .  
What we didn’t like : 
- no slippers or rope or even phone in the bungalow . It is very basic for the money we payed we’ve expected more comfort although the bed was very comfy !  
- the pool towels - there was no stuff taking care of it you have to run from one bar to another to find someone to get the towel and then same story to give it back  . Not the stuff fault . Simply add a person responsible only for pool . Again service  nit worth the money we payed . 
- Also breakfast only 4 options and if you are like us traveling with child you have to order for little one a separate portion .  In all the hotels we stayed included breakfast was much better 
Even if it’s semi buffet you still can find some food for little one.  At la Joya we had to order a whole breakfast for a two year old kid . Also their restaurant didn’t had any kid menu . So obviously again a proper portion for a two year old . I think considering remote location the resort could be more welcoming towards guest offering some more options in terms of food or entertainment. 
It was good for once but there are so many resorts that offer better service ."
"Beautyfull ocean, great place to chilling"
Will definately come back!
"If you do not like water activities & sun, this may be a good place for you to stay & enjoy yourself in the hotel enjoying the facilities. We have a private pool room with the most beautiful view in the hotel.  Amenities should be improved like Room slippers, tables & chairs for for make up or some writing convenience. Stay at the hotel as the rest of the place of interest is a bit far away apart from Balangan beach, GWK."
very recomended
"The resort is really beautiful and has excellent facilities. Great swimming pools by the ocean, lovely restaurant and bar, fantastic spa - you really don't need to leave! 
The only negative is that it is quite far from everything in Uluwatu and the staff don't let you book Grab or Gojek. Instead, they make you use their own drivers at approximately 3 times the cost of Grab or Gojek! I don't think this is right."
The location is amazing with a fantastic pool. The rooms are a bit dated but very clean with a lovely outdoor area. My mattress definitely needed to be replaced as it had big dents in it.
"The hotel was nice with excellent view and 3 pools available, direct access the beach, becareful of the wild monkeys"
"Food best, nice view.. amazing"
have a nice experice stay here.. pool area so cozy .. chill'n with beautifull view
"Beautiful view, access to go down to beach, very good breakfast. but you need to change prices cause pay 50k for water when all other places charge 10k is too much. Massage was average, again only view from spa was great. Also this taxi mafia thing doesn’t make any sense, I walked 5 min from hotel and booked online anyway every time. I recommend this hotel for couple of nights to enjoy panoramic views"
Loved this place a hidden gem.
"Excellent place, staff,  accomodation and kids friendly"
"Good:
- The sea iew is unbeatable. You can chill at the pools/ swimming pool beds with an excellent view
- The room is clean and comfortable
- There is a private beach without any crowds. Avoid going there when the wind is strong though.
- The food and juice in The View resturant exceeds expectation
Bad:
- The location is far from other attractions. It is better if you spend your whole day inaide the villa rather than having other plans.
- You need to use their loval taxi service, which is at least double of the price you can find on Grab/ Gojek
- Despite we choose the sunset massage package, actually you cannot see the aunset inside the spa area. Yet, having massage with aound of sea waves is relaxing.
- When we enquire and book the Open Bath, the staff doesn't tell us there is a charge for this."
"Room was spacious & could accommodate our 2 kids actually. Breakfast & Dinner was awesome in The View. FYI this resort is deep inside the Balangan village, ideal for guest who wish to stay inside the resort only, as the resort was quite far from town and very dark and eerie to go out at night time. Overall this hotel was good and will come back again with the kids....."
"highly recommended to stay at la joya biu biu, the real hidden gem"
"Stunning view, great service. Love the pool."
Hidden gem at uluwatu .
"The staff was good but a little slow very slim selection on foods and not impressed with not having access to outside taxi, and there car service and drivers keep bugging you to use there service but expensive and the resort was quite far from amenities."
"Love the view, looking straight to the sea, plus there is also a beach you can visit (10 min walk ). The food provided is great, love the juice."
"The cliff views from the resort are gorgeous, the grounds as well.  However, the room was old and the bed sheets had a strong smell like humidity."
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Getting into the hotel wasn't exactly easy as our rented car had to traverse plenty of narrow and windy roads as it isn't exactly that close to Jimbaran.
The chalets were simple and unassuming enough. You have your basic amenities like air-conditioning and wifi, but there wasn't a tv in the room. That was fine for us as the view (only a few steps from our chalet) was mind-blowing. Viewing a sunset from the pool deck will certainly be one of your most enduring memories of this place. There's also a private beach only for hotel guests to use.
Overall, this place isn't too bad. You'll get spectacular views right at your doorstep for the cost of sacrificing some convenience and creature comforts. If that's okay with you, then this is the spot for you."
"+: near small hidden beach, spacious room with a sofabed, good interior, nice infinity pools, very good view
-: please add some more fences near the cliff, not realy suit for family with toddler, i dont like dogs, theres a bunch of dogs at the parking lot and no staff there"
"I thought the resort was in Uluwatu, but apparently it’s in Balangan which far away from anywhere :( Beautiful place in the cliff but unfortunately the road to go there isn’t easy guys!"
"Awesome View, nothing else
Very hard to find, seriously. You will need a vehicle.
Narrow sreeet dan very dark.
Standard pool, standard room, 
Unfriendly staff.
They only provide alacarte bfast.
Advice =
Go find other hotel, there's ton's of good hotel, with astonishing view, friendly staff in Bali."
"The location and the streets going here are such a pain in the ass. I think you can get other options without the hassle of going to such a secluded location. 
They also do not allow you to use Grab, so you have to use their suggested drivers instead. What a scam."
"Resort is nice pools. Location abit out of the way. Rooms were quite dirty and old. Curtains  does not block out light and room is not noise proof, not great if you're a light sleeper."
"The aircon and water in room was not up to Standaed. This had to be checked multiple times by staff. After moving rooms, the water pressure and volume was better but aircon was insufficient. 
We also found bed bugs on the bed. As it was the second last night, we didn’t request for another room change."
"Old, Old room.  We stayed in Nina 6 (including a good B/F), which was a villa, but not a real villa.  This unit had a loft with a bes, so you could sleep 4. In fact, villas were the only available room when we booked.  The Bungaloes are much bigger and nicer. The pool was nice, the restaurant was good, with good food, but expensive.  The REAL sale for this property is the view, with massive cliffs and crashing waves.  IG-able for sure.  That's why we paid what I consider a big premium for this stay. So, maybe stay one night for the views and photo ops, but no longer. Also, no headboard, so almost impossible to sit up and work or play on laptop."
I contracted covid on the day of check in (PCR result positive) but they did not allow us to move our booking to a later date. So they rather put their other guests and staff at risk of getting sick than letting us change our booking. Very strange decision by the management. Very disappointed.
"We booked yoga class when we arrived for the next day. Next day I woke up sick and couldn’t attend. I didn’t want to go, in case of Covid, so I wouldn’t make others sick too. They charged us anyway for it upon check out. Bad service, doesn’t care about you at reception. 
The staff at restaurant was nice, and beautiful view. The room was clean. But they are not service minded! And the place was far from town and expensive to get transfer to town."
"This hotel only have view as plus point, room ugly and dirty with a lot of sand (maybe wood dust from termite), no TV but internet quite good, if you looking to relax and want to hear ocean wave sound from your room, you'll be disappointed even your room located close to the cliff, if you came for the sunset you'll be disappointed as well, since the view face south and when sunset get block by landscape on the west, but this hotel really quite, if you don't mind with those shabby room and prefer quiet go for it, but this is not for me, will prefer  petitenget cheap hotel and use the rest of my money to go to Rock Bar for tge view, Sunset and good food/drink, 😁"
Not being notified about transportation and drone policies verbally and it wasn't listed in agoda. We were forced to use their local community drivers with absurb charges 3 times the normal.
"This cliff top resort is a hidden gem. Stunning views, friendly staff and lovely architecture really make this location something special."
"Excellent resort for a little over $100 per
Night. Staff could not do enough for you."
"No room slipper, no tv, don’t have breakfast buffet style, little facilities provided."
"The hotel is beautiful, the pool is magnificent, next to private beach, the restaurant food also delicious. But the place is quite far from main road and not allow to order taxi online, the guess have to take local taxi, which is expensive."
We enjoyed our family stay across two villas a lot. La Hoya Biu Biu is a special place. Close enough to many things but far enough away to be relaxing.
A wonderful hotel with breathtaking views from the restaurant on the cliff.
"Under heavy raining, leaking from the roof
Leakage from the toilet bowl, the floor was wet
Due to the air conditioner, the window glass was vibrating and extremely noisy, i needed fo fix it for the hotel"
"Most like: private beach with white sand, two swimming pools
Too bad: cliff view spa was under renovation, second floor area in the family & friends had some strange smell"
"Little gem. The view is amazing, the infinity pool is great. Staff is super kind and very welcoming. Rooms are big and comfy"
"Beautiful bungalows, outstanding pool, just a tiny bit pretentious and over-built for my personal taste. 
Restaurant is def too pricey for what it is, it can improve the menu."
Good hotel. Recommended hotel. Thanks a lot. Very Cool. Satisfied.
"The best views ever, really recommend for anyone who love to stay quiet and near natural, hotel facilities all are new and clean, staff are friendly and helpful, my family and I have a great time staying there, will comeback again for sure!"
"They charge me deposit, and told me it would be cancel after check out.
Now i checked out hotel 2wks ago, but still they didn’t cancel the deposit. And im still waiting.  I also so many complains about this problem from korean customers, the hotel must be check this problem."
On of the best view
Best location for mind relaxing.
"Resort has the most beautiful views from the infinity pool. Very relaxing place, staff is very friendly and accommodating. Always willing to help where they can. Will definitely be back"
Outrageous location! Captivating scenery! Incredible staff and delicious dining. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!!!
Peaceful and lovely property. Wonderful breakfast. If you don't have a car or bike  it is a bit far away from anything so be mindful that you will not be able to explore so easily. Also you can't order an uber to the hotel so consider that when booking.
"We had a wonderful stay, only negative was that the spa was still in renovations, but location, pool area and breakfast was fantastic."
The stunning view makes this place perfect for your next bali vacation!! The ocean view lodge was a perfect room for us ! The private pool on the clif makes you feel connected to the ocean !!
"This place is amazing! So glad we started our trip here, beautiful beach and walking distance to kubu beach and balang beach. Staff was very friendly and helpful"
Pretty view
"We stayed 1night in la joya, it was really fantastic memory in la joya.. if i have a chance to go back to bail, i will compiltely stay here one more, an incredable view, the beautiful infinite pool, nice staffs, everything was perfect for us.. we miss this resory already"
Love the view and it even has access to the beach. Its fast from the center so just to take advantage of the facilities in the resort. Food was delicious no need to go out!
Such a gorgeous villa and site! Watched the sunset from the restaurant and pool every night it was amazing! The bathroom was also so cool. Definitely recommend to couples as it is so beautiful and not too many kids around. Very relaxing place!
"We spent 3 nights at La Joya Biu Biu. After transfering to different hotels we actually missed our LaJoya experience. Amazing views, very nice pool with nice music, boutique hotel atmosphere (not many people, calm, relaxing vibe), great food, nice spacecious cottage rooms. Many „Instagram” spots if you like it ;) we loved absolutely everything about this hotel. Also great private beach beneath the hotel. Do not hesitate, its totally worth to go to La Joya!"
"Best location with view and everything you need is there, we will be back ♥️"
We had a wonderful start to our Bali journey in this hotel for 5 nights. We loved it here with this amazing friendly staff and the great view towards Java. Breakfast was delicious and we also loved to go to the little beach although it was not really possible to swim because of strong waves and current. But there are like natural pools during low tide which are just lovely to take a bath.
"From the views to the room to the resort! All gorgeous. Great food, wonderful staff. Was sad to leave."
"If your looking for a relaxed resort with  stunning views and friendly staff, this place is for you"
"Great atmosphere
- specially pool area
Great food
Wish the room cleaning seem a bit careless"
"Location is amazing, they have pool  and restaurant with ocean view. They have their own spa as well. Location is photogenic.
Only con is that they have basic amenity missing as room sleepers"
Don’t miss the spa
Tip Top
Definitely will repeat again!!! So worth it
"Me and my wife traveling world.
This property open if best resort. Front desk clock was so professional. Restaurant foods are so good , 
Strong recommendation."
Keep it up
"El hotel me ha parecido bonito y tiene una cala privada pero no volvería principalmente por dos motivos: en primer lugar la comida del restaurante es muy cara (una cerveza más de 5€) y nos pareció bastante mala, y en segundo lugar no se puede usar Grab ni Gojek desde el hotel (te obligan a coger los taxis del hotel y las tarifas son más del doble). A parte, aunque menos importante, si necesitas hacer colada también sale excepcionalmente caro, nos cobraban por artículo en lugar de por kg, y nos salía a pagar muchísimo…"
"Excelentes instalaciones: bungalows, piscinas, restaurante, sala de masajes… Personal encantador y atento. Desayuno riquísimo y abundante, y el suplemento por desayuno flotante asequible.  La playa de acceso privado muy bonita. Excelente puesta de sol."
"Resort precioso, vistas impresionantes, piscinas increíbles, el personal super amable y atento, muy limpio y cuidado todo. La cama super cómoda y la comida buenísima, no puedo decir absolutamente nada negativo. Repetiría sin dudarlo!!"
Magnifique hôtel avec une vue imprenable sur la mer et des bungalows plein de charme ! Un service impecable!
"Très bel endroit, dommage de ne pas avoir d’autres choix que de prendre les taxis à l’entrée de l’hôtel, donc obligé de payer le prix qu’ils demandent, c’est-à-dire 2 à 3 fois le prix normal…"
"Nous avons passé un weekend détente et l'hôtel était très satisfaisant. 
Magnifique vue, très belle décoration, piscines agréable avec vue sur l'océan.
Chambre très propres charmante a l'intérieur. Seul point négatif pas d'intimité.
Les clients ont une vue directe sur les chambres.
Sinon très beau cadre"
Hôtel avec une superbe vue sur l’océan. Personnel au top
Ils vous oblige à prendre leur service de transport (pas le droit d’appeler un taxi ou uber) qui coute 2x plus cher
Bel emplacement en bord de falaise avec une superbe vue. Les piscines sont top.
"Je recommande à 100%.  On a passé un excellent séjour à LA JOYA BIU BIU. Le personnel est adorable, l’hôtel ainsi les extérieurs sont très bien entretenus, tout était très propre. Et la vue est magnifique, chaque jour nous étions émerveillés par la beauté du lieu !! Je ne peux que recommander et je reviendrai avec GRAND plaisir !"
