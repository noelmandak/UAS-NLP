"Staffs were really friendly and helpful. Rooms are extremely clean. You can walk around the tiled floor without slippers and you won’t see any dirt in your feet! You can see them clean the facilities everyday too! They clean the room and changes the sheets and towels everyday. Replenish the bottled water everyday too! Breakfast is buffet and food is very good. Water is strong and with hot and cold shower. Location is very near the beach, La Brisa, Como and convenience stores. Will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends who stays in Canggu. Two thumbs up!"
Super lovely hotel with multiple pools so never too busy. We splurged for the garden view which was away from the street (guessing street facing rooms are a bit loud) and had a nice pool right outside. Very happy with this oasis.
the room and bathroom is quite spacious and nice. it was a really good value for the money! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean place to stay.
"Initially I booked one week at Papillon but I ended up staying for 1,5 months. This is a perfect place! The premises are well maintained (which is rare for Bali); the rooms have got everything you need (except maybe a safety box); the personnel is super kind and responsive. I loved the open bathroom in my King room and taking morning showers with the sun rays. The hotel is just a couple minute walk away from the ocean. Plenty of restaurants, shops, pharmacies, spas, ATMs around + a coworking just next door."
"simple room, amazing stay, three pools, simple breakfast or big breakfast you choose- great lattes, superb staff, great cable-one main drawback for me was the WiFi but otherwise a minutes walk to the beach and most anywhere else."
"Great location, close to the beach, shops and places to eat.
Friendly staffs made our stay very comfortable.
We would definately return"
"Great value in terms of location, amenities, and price. We would absolutely stay again."
Simple and clean stay. Great service. Cosy and comfortable. Breakfast not recommended. Accomodating staff and friendly interactions at all times.
I found the Papillon Echobeach to be well located (100mts from beach). The facilities are good and the staff was extremely helpful. Thank you :)
"We book a King Room for 3 nights, get direct pool access and large bathroom with bathtub.. very nice room for relaxing day.."
"Great service, great hidden location. Great representation of the preview compared to the real presentation of the rooms. The only minus is that the doors are not really insulated from the noise outside the room. Our room was very close to the swimming pool and it’s hard to relax when the sound of water splashing and kids shouting just kept on going throughout the afternoon. Bed frame was also squeaky to the touch. All in all, 4.5 out of 5."
"Good location, good price and wonderful staff"
Loved this place until about 8pm. There is a bar across the street with live music and its extremely loud. I also woke up to very loud banging due to construction next door. Other than that it was an amazing hotel but don't stay here if you need quiet time.
The price value fits everyone’s budget.. the room is spacious and Also the bathroom.. Closeby to the beach
Great staff and nice rooms with upgrade
"Perfect stay with 2 kids. Very nice stay. Very friendly people. Kids happy, me happy."
"Papillon is very conveniently located near Batu Bolong Beach and La Brisa Beach Club. They have clean room, fast internet connection and staff were friendly. Breakfast is average for a hotel of their standard."
Clean and walking distance to all hotshots around Canggu
"keep in mind this is a cheap and affordable accommodation option and for the price it was pretty good. close location, clean and spacious room and bathroom. has a pool but no gym, but not modern or updated"
This was my second time staying here and I'll be back.. nice place ...great staff
"This hotel is located only 3 minutes away from a beach (I think it is not exactly Echo Beach but an extension of it, though I am not sure). It is a great location if you are looking to visit the beach every day. There are also several good eating spots nearby the hotel such as Wahaha Pork Ribs (when I passed by it was always closed, so keep this in mind). Otherwise, it is a bit far from everywhere else and you have to depend on car/motorcycle to get around. This is a bit problematic because I initially planned to walk everywhere.
I booked the Queen Room and really got the room located beside the pool. It was nice externally, but the room itself was not great. They did not provide any amenities at all (except for soap-shampoo hybrid in a wall-attached container). The room was also dark because there was only two yellow lamps. It gave off a very traditional vibe, which several people might not expect especially compared to the photos provided.
Overall, I would recommend the hotel based on the proximity to the beach. However, if you are the type who disliked traditional decoration, please reconsider."
"The rooms were clean but smelly, and the bathrooms are definitely not what you expect for for this amount of money. 
Prime location, breakfast is okay, but the rooms are facing the street and it’s so noisy at night! I wouldn’t recommend staying here if you’re looking for a quiet stay."
"Located in the happening place of Canggu, very near to La Brisa club and surfing beach of Echo. The room was a bit small and facilities weren't so great, but it's rather cheap for the location. Breakfast was Indonesian style, so there wasn't much diversity -- it could have been better. However, I still enjoyed my stay there!"
"Hptel is basic and not perfectly mantain, the cleaning is done daily but superficial,  normal for Bali I would say. the staff is very friendly and helpful. The internet is ok. The rooms on the street are noisy from the street, please be sure to check where your room is before you book. There is a bar across the hotel with live music every evening going until 1-2 am."
"My first night arrival, they placed me in the room loudest next to a Karaoke bar. Obviously it wasnt going to work out. So i asked to change rooms and they offered a very nice room in the back for 200k more. So i felt like i had no choice but to upgrade. Then it happened the second night they wanted to place me back into the loud room. I had to upgrade again. Dont get me wrong, their bigger rooms in the back are nice. But then 3rd day they asked if i want a better room and asked to upgrade another for another 100k… at this point im wondering why i kept being asked to get upgraded. The cheaper rooms you can definitely hear the loud karaoke night club. I rather have them be upfront with me and tell me my room is loud. Rather than to check in, find out i either have to deal with it or have no option but to pay 200k to stay there. Just beware"
I highly recommend this hotel if you’re traveling as a couple or with a few friends
"It was my first stop. Its a good hotel, clean enough and good location. Room clean enough but i could hear many noises during night. The best rooms have pool view. The rooms with a street view have a pub opposite which can get a bit loud at night. Going to your room during night might find yourself stepping on a frog! Pool could get a bit cleaner. I didn't use it. I recommend it for some days. I would consider staying there again maybe on a better offer"
"Great location, but the room smelled like mold and is a bit outdated. They cleaned the room every day tho."
"I chose Echo Papillion because of its location and price and the photos looked great. The first night I came home to spiders in my room and insects and ran to reception to let them know that I had to change rooms. They said there were no other rooms available. They sent staff to kill the spiders in my room, and when the staff left, I found more spiders in my room and then asked again to change rooms. After I demanded they somehow found me another room, after them saying they were overbooked. It wasn’t even an upgrade, so I found it strange. 
Breakfast was terrible, the worst I’ve had in Bali and I didn’t think it was possible to go wrong with a breakfast.
Rooms were ok and very basic. Light in bathroom did not work but the bed was very comfortable.
They really need to take more care of their public bathrooms by restaurant because that was disgusting."
"The location is nearly to the echo beach and the mini mart easy for everything, the room is clean"
Super good value for money Hotel! Location is the best
"Small hotel but clean, very close to the beach just walk about 5 min but very difficult to park the car. Hotel resto serve varied meal. Try fried rice n noodle taste is ok."
"I would love to recommend for those who loves to stay nearby beach. Just walking distance but when you enter to this hotel, you can see the fish pond so dirty, the reception area looked old.. must upgrade especially your furnitures.. i hd bad experienced for my first day here. From my booking was hotel access to the pool but sadly I got room only same level to the pool. Then they changed my room the behind and got another 2nd pool.. I understand your pool near to trees and it’s not easy to clean every second but I felt this hotel not maintain your facilities and it looked so dirty.. this is my honest opinion. Hope you can maintain and upgrade to serve better for the future. Your location was good.."
We stay in Superior room which really small room208 .bed so comfortable. No fridge in the room.staff super nice and helpful. Breakfast average not much choice. Close to walk to the beach 5min.lots of restaurants nearby. If you choose the deluxe room or villa room.will be nicer
"Staff are nice and pleasant and the mattress was comfy. 
However the room very was noisy, the bars next to us had loud music until 12. There isn’t much room by the pools to sun bathe and I think it’s a little over priced for the facilities."
"When you enter the hotel you will notice a fishy smell which is no surprise because they keep the fish in a pool at the reception. There are way too many fish and you can tell by their colour and them not having a place to swim that they are not happy. 
The room itself would have been okay, if there wasn't that moldy smell. When we talked to the reception because we wanted to change rooms they said that they would spray some perfume and they would clean the room properly. After the strong smell of the cleaning products passed away the smell of the mold was back. The walls are thin, the breakfast would be okay if there wouldn't be the smell of the fish at the reception 🐟
Just to warn you: the water pressure of the bum gun is super strong
The pool in the garden is small but feels  like a little paradise."
Shocking breakfast
"Worst hotel we stayed at on our time in Bali, facilities are outdated and dull, brown stains around the bath, very loud overnight and not very private in the ""villa"" we had which was just a basic room."
Horrible smell in the rooms.
"This hotel was wonderful. It is only a five minute walk to Echo beach, the staff is friendly, the pools are gorgeous and almost always empty (when i was there), and the rooms are stunning. I got the largest villa room with an outdoor bathroom that was the size of a New York studio apartment. Wow! The only downside is that when it rains the sound is really loud because of the roof on the outdoor bathroom. But that is only a minor issue. It is very quiet and the bed is extremely comfortable. I got the best sleep that I have had since I started traveling in South East Asia. The restaurant is good, but I recommend eating in town for better value."
"We stayed for about a week here! It was nice comparably to a lot of the other hotels and homestays in the area, although for the price in other areas of Bali you could get a lot more! the staff is so nice and helpful - always friendly and willing to help. 
However we got bites in our sleep for a few nights until we switched rooms. 
The staff made it worth it though as well as the prime location."
"My partner and I stayed in one of their most expensive room with the private outdoor bathroom.
We did not like how the bed is right next to the sliding door with the shared pool right outside it. So we hear people talking, walking pass, swimming and etc.
And people sitting right at your doorway, just a bit weird.
And cause it’s an outdoor bathroom, definitely not suitable for people who are scared of bugs, geckos and frogs, it gets worse on rainy days.
However, staffs are super friendly and helpful. Room is clean and tidy. The location of the hotel is less than 100m away from Echo beach. There are plenty of shops, restaurants and convenient stores around."
Great location. The pool view/villa rooms are great. But our friend stayed in the regular hotel room on the second floor and it smelled damp and was noisy from the bars outside.
"Great location, very friendly and helpful staff. The pools are more private to their adjoining rooms though, so didn’t see fit to take advantage of them as we were on the 2nd floor. Short walk to echo beach. Also no grudges in the rooms."
"Great location near the beach, but very quiet. Rooms are large and nicely furbished.
I had the villa and had to share the pool with only 6 other rooms.
Staff is very nice and helpful."
"Clean modern hotel.
Close to Echo Beach.
Lovely helpful staff, very welcoming"
"A lot of construction going on! The cheaper room didn't look anything like the photo. We    Had to change rooms which was better and bathrooms were nice and big. Location is great.
Wasnt very inviting sitting by the pool while there were people working everywhere. 
Probably wouldn't stay again"
The pool view rooms are value for money. No rooms above to hear for noise etc.
"Great location.
Great rooms.
Excellent and helpful staff"
"Thanks for a great stay, we had the villas which overlooked the pool. These were great!"
"hated the key slot system, you need to insert the key card to get the whole room electricity supply, unfortunately to lock the room you'll need to insert the key into the key hole, unlike other hotel where you could just switch the lock. imagine you remove the key slot, the whole room is dark, and you need to insert the key into the keyhole to unlock the door in the darkness??? toilet door hinge is spoiled, bed head got spider web and dust in layers, super noisy from the bar across the street, it is never worth the money to pay for this kind of room, there are others hotel along the same street which you could get better facilities and cleanliness. I wrote a review in google to the hotel, my review was deleted, can you imagine that?
will never go back"
"Location awesome,  BBQ on beach great surf action"
Best place who works at Dojo
"Good place to stay but unfortunately the restaurant not open 24hours and this property doesn't have plates, bowl or kitchenette, so I'mpossible to order from outside. 
I stayed at the room in front of the pool and it was raining, so all the ants are coming to my room. So tiring to handle this, even the hotel doesn't know what to do."
"Prompted for this review from extending my stay.  See May 2, 2023 review.  It's a great place.  Can't say enough about it and the staff."
"Prompted for this review from extending my stay.  See May 2, 2023 review.  It's a great place.  Can't say enough about it and the staff."
Very good
Staff is super helpful. Breakfast has variety and is good quality. I really enjoyed the pool
"pros :
- room is big, quiet, clean, bad super comfy 
- locatian is amazing, just walk distance to the beach, La Brisa, and surrounded by mini markets
- staffs are super friendly & helpful
cons : 
- grab/gojek are not allowed to pick up you at the hotel, because there's local taxi which is more expensive. so you have to walk around 300m to meet the driver when you insist use gojek/grab
- breakfast are boring, not tasty
- floor was a bit slippery (especially on the 2nd floor when you have to pass the road with no roof to get into the room)"
"i stayed 4D3N in deluxe room with garden view and breakfast included.
hotel staff service: friendly and efficient.
bedroom: spacious. extremely clean for a 3-star hotel standard. wooden furniture was in good condition. bed was so comfortable and sheets were clean. if other type of rooms have the same quality of this bed, it was worth the price.
bathroom: ridiculously so spacious, as big as the bedroom. water pressure was nice. much water so needed just a little bit to lift the faucet (too high, flood then). hot water was working fine.
room surrounding: quiet, waterfall sound from the pool below, sometimes could hear birds chirping, a few times could hear tokek (gecko) sound.
breakfast: plenty of choices. didn't expect much at first but apparently it made my tummy happy. fried rice was non salty type (typical bali taste or standard hotels). having 3 days of different breakfast menu and loved all days.
surrounding restaurants: a short walk to la brisa, la baruna, koast, teh manis, smoke bali, garden canggu. up to 10 min walk to penny lane, chow chow, mason, billy ho, sari kitchen, ji restaurant, old man's. up to 20 min walk to hippie fish, sol rooftop, boheme canggu, shelter, mostly, woods pererenan, brunch club.
thank you so much to papillon for upgrading my room and making my stay a very pleasant one!"
"The service and smiles here are A1.  I am not lying when I say they know what you need/want before you even ask.  The sweet waitress at the breakfast in the morning would see my husband and I getting coffee and she'd be right there ready to pour hot milk in it.  We were greated in the hallways, passing by the front desk, at the pool.  Even when they eere cleaning other rooms they would take the time to say hi.  Genuine kindness.  The rooms were spotless.  Housekeeping daily if you need it.  Breakfast was delish.  Eggs done any way you want.  Omelet was delish with peppers, tomato and onions in it.  Beautiful fresh sour dough bread made great toast.  Canggu and Echo Beach is a great area."
"I’m a solo traveler and I enjoyed my stay here. Close to the beach , walking distance to nearby eatery and massage parlour. Staffs are friendly and breakfast was not bad! They have pancakes and sourdough bread which I enjoyed. My room is really clean with comfortable bed. Enjoyed my stay there.the bathroom is clean too ! Even though there were a weird smell when I turned on the shower head , but it quickly disappeared after I left the water running for a minute or Two. So not much an issue for me."
"Overall, I had a great stay here. 
Pro’s
- by the beach
- some great bars and restaurants nearby
- hotel restaurant does good food
- fairly quiet and choice of pools
- great WiFi 
- staff were so friendly and helpful
Con’s
- no fridge in room (though I later found out that some rooms do have one which was disappointing)
- some noise late eve from bar over the road
- grab/Gojek can’t pick up from hotel only local taxis or walking"
"Booked 3 king rooms to stay with 5 adults and 3 kids, rooms are spacious, bathroom even more spacious. Rooms are clean and comfortable, mattresses and pillows are on the soft side io firm. Fair lighting, if you need more lights on the room, just open the curtains on the door. Breakfast were fine, staffs are kind and very helpful.  Location wise, very nice, walking distance to Megada Beach and La Brissa however ordering On-line Taxi service will be an issue since they couldn't pick you up right in front of hotel, you have to walk further for 8-10mins.  If you don't have plan to leave that area, it's still fine since there are a lot of restaurant, juice bar, laundromat, pharmacies, even supermarket, all in radius 300meter"
"A effortable and cozy hotel at walking distance to la Brisa beach club, along the street that is few nice restaurants too.
Grab couldn't picking up from the hotel, we need to walk about 5 -10min to the pick up points, if u are having a big luggage, I suggest u leave at the morning, the taxi still able to pick up from hotel, but if its pick hours, you might need to walk to the assignation pick up point with the luggage"
"Beautiful property .
C There is loud music well I tot he early mornings. The bathroom light shines into the bedroom which can be alarming when sleeping.  It’s a great place to lay ya head if your a person who’s out n about all the time. Waking distance to great spots!"
"Great location, walking distance to a lot of things and super close to the beach. Would love to stay here again."
Good hotel
"I extended my stay twice. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The rooms are of a good size. Motor bike parking underneath the hotel. Breakfast was good, if a bit repetitive. Do try and get a room away from the front of the hotel, as the sports bar opposite has good, but loud music till about 23.00."
"Papillon Echobeach is a lovely hotel within walking distance to shops, warungs, restaurants, the beach, art market, ATM and transport. Definitely recommend for any first time traveller to Bali! Enjoyed our stay."
"Overall it was good
I wouldnt mind to stay again 
But you may expect cockroaches in toliet 
And frogs if you are lucky enough."
"Nice staff, and it's clean
Only issue it that if you don't drive your own scooter it's a problem there. Grab and Gojek services are forbidden there- so it's a problem"
"Very nice and clean room with big size bathroom! Pool is right in front of the room. Location is great as well, few minutes away from the beach. Stuff is very nice and helpful! We really enjoyed our time at hotel Papillon Echobeach! Definitely will be back next time!"
"Awesome staff, excellent location close to beach, motorcycle parking underneath the hotel, room of a good size and very clean. Breakfast was ok, a bit repetitive. No fridge in room. Overall I was really happy."
"Lovely staff and friendly service!! Nice and quite room as per my request. Great pool for relaxing and chilling at hotel, beautiful garden setting too :)
Highly recommended 👍🌟"
"the location is facing the road, so the only downside about this would be that it is extremely noisy at night. it is directly opposite from a bar that plays a live band / music. so shutting the windows wont help. location wise, it is walkable distance to the beach and many eateries. :)"
"I liked my top floor deluxe room, which is super basic but cheap and still has breakfast.  The music doesn’t go late so it’s no bother.  I ended up staying longer and got the king room which was  nice for bathroom but honestly not worth double the price. Just accept a basic bathroom, and use that extra cash for massages/food. None of rooms had hot water."
"I booked a queen room but was told at check-in that the room wasn't available. I was ""upgraded"" to a king room, but I specifically didn't want to book a king room because the bathroom was outdoors and reviews said there were lots of insects. The staff kindly refunded me the first night and allowed me to move to a queen room the next day. But the queen room bathroom also had several insects despite being indoors. I had to ask the staff to come spray the bathroom.
The room was comfortable though, and the pools were nice."
"Stayed for 4 nights.
Lovely room & comfy bed 
Perfect a/c 
Only bad thing was the shower, water wasn't warm 🙃"
Good
Es el mejor hotel donde he estado en Bali! Todo perfecto. volveré:)
"Buena localización
Wifi decente
Varias piscinas y zonas de relax
Localización algo apartada y tranquila"
"L'hôtel est bien placer pour aller a la plage a pied. 
Nous avions une chambre avec concert tous les soirs tard ... donc pas facile de se reposer. La fenêtre est epaisse comme du papier on entend tout. 
Les chambres sont petites la salle de bain a une odeur de renfermé/moisie caché par un produit. 
La piscine (enfet se qont 3 minis piscines) avec 2 transats au bord de chacune. Autour il ya des chambres et l'eau verte ne donne pas envie. 
Le personnel est très simpas et serviable le petit dejeuner il faut aimer le sale !! Mais très bon quand même :)"
"Super emplacement à deux pas de la plage. L’hôtel est très jolie, nous n’avons pas utilisé les piscines. Le petit déjeuner est moyen avec peu de choix et pas de sucré."
"Direkt gegenüber einer Pub.
Es lohnt sich eine Villa zu nehmen, wenn Ruhe erwünscht. Und die Villen sind viel viel besser als die normalen Zimmer. Gutes Frühstück (offenes Buffet). Freundliches Personal. Zentrale Lage. Nur 2 Minuten vom Strand entfernt. Gerne wieder.."
"- sehr nette und hilfsbereite Mitarbeiter 
- gute Lage 
- Zimmer enthalten alles was gebraucht wird 
- Frühstück okay (für deutsche Verhältnisse gewöhnungsbedürftig)"
Wie wollten mal uns für die letzten Tage was besseres gönnen und haben ein Zimmer erhalten wo man noch nicht mal lüften konnte und es hat wirklich sehr schlecht gerochen wie auch das Bad aber alles hermetisch abgeriegelt. Wir sind leider so spät abends u total kaputt angekommen das wir nicht gleich reklamiert haben. Das ganze Hotel ist auf gewollt europäisch konzipiert aber leider ohne Sinn und Verstand. Das Zimmer hat ein Bad mit Badewanne aber die ist so bescheuert eingebaut. Dann war leider das Zimmer noch gegenüber der einzigsten bar die dann bis 3 Uhr morgens noch laut Musik gespielt hat. Den Pool zum Baden kann man komplett vergessen: witzig und von Zimmern umgeben. Frühstück ist ja sowieso nicht dabei und das Personal war bei uns ziemlich genervt und hat uns einfach schnell abgefertigt. Eine Nacht und die war schon zuviel. Nur das Bett war wirklich weich und groß. Gibt viele bessere auf der Ecke für weniger Geld.
We hadden de kamer met buiten ligbad en douche . Alles was naar wens . Mooi groot en goed schoon .Leuk zwembadje erbij. Er waren er 3.   Alleen het ontbijt was wat sober. Een kleine update was op zijn plek .
"Totaal niet zoals op de foto's en zoals omschreven, absoluut niet hygienisch. Vies geur hing er in de kamer. Voelde me ongemakkelijk volgende dag direct weg."
"Dit hotel heeft de beste prijs/kwaliteit verhouding van heel Bali. Vlakbij het strand, vlakbij clubs en winkels, vlakbij de lekkerste restaurants, maar toch rustig gelegen. Zorg wel dat je een kamer achter op het resort boekt, want de sportsbar kan erg veel herrie maken. 
De bedden sliepen heerlijk, de douche was goed en het ontbijt was ook precies wat we nodig hadden."
"Het hotel ligt op 5 minuten lopen van Echo Beach, het leukste strand van Canggu. Mooie, ruime kamer met goed en groot bed. De buitenbadkamer heeft zeker zijn charme, maar zorgt er ook voor dat er veel beestjes rondvliegen en -kruipen. 
De plaatsing van de wc-rol houder -direct naast de douche- had handiger gekunt en een extra prullenbakje in de kamer zou ook fijn zijn. Maar daarmee zijn de belangrijkste verbeterpunten ook meteen genoemd.
De kamer werd elke dag keurig schoongemaakt en voorzien van nieuwe handdoeken. Al het personeel is superaardig en behulpzaam. Wij zouden dit hotel zeker aanraden als je in Canggu wil verblijven."
"Da pra fazer tudo por perto, caminhando até a praia, lindo e limpo!"
良かったです。
"Hotel dan staff baik, sayangnya lokasi agak jauh kemana mana"
"kamar yang di tempatin bersih hanya hotel tidak menyediakan sikat gigi , untuk lokasi strategis dekat pantai dekat dengan la brisa"
Best dan bakal balik lagi!
너무 시끄러워요.. 그리고 호텔쪽은 진짜 구려요… 돈 더내고 방 바꿨어요.. 빌라로
"에코비치 바로 앞, 라브리사 옆에 위치하여 라브리사에 방문한다면 하루 묵는걸 추천. 옆에 가디언도 있고 주변에 카페가 많아 위치적으로 좋음."
Lokasi ok. Keren
"buat turis yang bawa anak, hotel ini tdk di sarankan, karena sangat minim fasilitas untuk anak. dan beberapa hal tidak tersedia seperti gantungan baju di toilet juga tidak tersedia..."
Отличный отель возле пляжа
"в номерах грязно, муравьи. Нет фена, нужно просить на ресепшн, очень скромный завтрак, сходили один раз, теперь ходим в соседние кафе"
"Неплохой отель. Близко к океану, но пляж поблизости не для купания, только для сёрфа, причем не для новичков. Если для вас важна тишина, то просите номер дальше от дороги, по тому что через дорогу рок-бар, музыка в котором стихает только в 12 ночи, а иногда и позже. Завтрак довольно посредственный, но персонал очень дружелюбный и стремится помочь. В кафетерии при отеле можно посидеть с ноутбуком, есть розетки."
"Очень скудные завтраки.
Нет сейфа и фена в номере.
Номера маленькие, раковина у нас в номере текла. Все мокрое возле неё было. Мебель старая. 
Обслуживание хорошее."
"Прекрасный персонал, маленький уютный бассейн, идеальное расположение, уборка на 5+, но если вам нужна тишина, то здесь окна у некоторых номеров выходят на паб, где каждый вечер живой концерт. Но для меня это плюс - лайф концерт у тебя под окнами :) Всё понравилось!"
Perfect stay
