"Hotel is in a great location if you want to be close to The Forge/Shi Shi.
The rooms are large and the beds extra large. Linen and towels were crisp and clean. I had a very quiet room with a nice balcony.
Room service options were nice and very fairly priced.
The rooftop pool has nice views at sunset.
The common areas of the hotel need a bit of maintenance but that did affect my stay at all.
Overall, great hotel if you are looking for somewhere to sleep and shower."
"My room was very comfortable, clean and spacious. The AC was cool enough, the water pressure is good. The amenities is good. The WiFi is quite fast for watching Netflix.
The staff was very friendly and accommodating my needs. 
It's in the petitenget area which is a strategic area, in a walking distance to a good coffee shops and restaurants. (Few of my fave places near this hotel, Mannaka coffee, it's just a small coffee shop but their coffee is excellent for my taste. Rayjin tepanyaki and Taco Casa)
Will be back again!"
"Location was easy to find and right next to pepito!!!
So far, honestly this hotel provides the best pillow ever. I bought my own small pillow but I left them in the car becuse your pillows were so comfortable. I have been struggling sleeping but once I arrived I slept through until midday the next day. I wonder what brand you use. Bathroom is spacious, clogged a bit but fixed by them. Done. Bed fits 3 adults or 2 adulta with 2 kids. Ac is cold. The room has balcony,  big sliding door for air circulation. Which I didnt expect when i booked the room, as mostly hotels at this low price dont have windows not alone a big sliding door to balcony. Definitely will come back here again."
We arrive early and ready to go out exploring. We ask if the hotel can took care of our luggages. They’re secure our back nicely. Staff are very nice and very helpful. The room is very big and bed is so comfy. We have such a good time here. The location is near everywhere we need to visited. Use grab bike is a tip for everyone who saw this and want to visit Seminyak.
"the hotel is located in good location, right next to a supermarket, within walking distance of several good restaurants and cafes. Online delivery app also have no difficulties finding the hotel, which makes it very convenient when you're feeling too lazy to go out. So, although, the hotel restaurant & all food related facilities are closed due to COVID hit, there won't be difficulties getting food. 
At the moment, only the first floor is opened as the hotel operates on minimum occupancy mode, but the staff is super helpful & friendly, the room is spacious & clean, they pay attention to COVID Protocol with masks, sanitizer, temperature check, & guest tracing, and the wifi is sufficient for my need. All in all, I'm satisfied with my staycation here. Will definitely stay here again in the future."
"Reasonable price, strategic location, friendly staffs, and comfortable room. Will go back for sure 😊"
"Hotel is clean affordable price and many shops around, pepito is 100m  and staff wonderful"
"Staffs are super helpful and friendly, room is clean with nice view, also location is goood!"
"If you like a spacious yet a cheap hotel room, this is the one. The location is strategic & the staff are friendly too"
"This is my 1st time staying at this new hotel. Very warm welcome. Upon arrival at the reception counter, we were served with I think a very light ice cold tea and a cold wet hand towel to soothes the hot day. It is very very hot day when we arrive. So we are very glad to get that kind of gesture. The hotel room was spacious, the marble floor was sparkling clean, the toilet is also ok nothing to complain :)"
"Location was great, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. They surprised me with a birthday fruit tart and were very welcoming. One thing to note though - the walls are very thin."
"Rates were p decent, The staff were really friendly and helpful.  All smiles every time. Location is superb. Next to a supermart and Walking distance to many great coffee places like Pison, Expat and Livingstone. Short bike ride to Seminyak central and 20 mins to Canggu. 
Only gripe I have with the place is that the wifi could be better. Video calls with my friends were really laggy. Charging ports are real slow.  Took me a whole night to have my phone at full charge (even with an IPad charger)
Travelled solo, but hotel’s amazing for couples as well. 
Would be staying again if I come back to Bali."
This place is kinda new..i love the location just on the right side there’s a supermarket and across there’s a place to eat some breakkie. I have a pleasant stay overall.
"Spacious room- very clean and safe environment. The location is strategic - able to walk to the beach and other restaurants. Super glad I found ""The Capital"" and will surely be back."
"Situated in a very convenient location close to a variety of eateries and convenience stores. Extremely clean and rooms were big and spacious as well. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Gym was well equipped even though we dint use it haha. Also wasn’t noisy at all, we had so many nights’ worth of good sleep!"
The staff went out of their way to make our stay special. They somehow noticed from my friend's passport that it was his birthday. They delivered a cake to the room as a surprise. They were very welcoming and friendly. The room was clean and balcony had a nice view. Would definitely recommend.
"New hotel in seminyak petitenget area. Next to this hotel, u can found a mini mart and close to other cafes too. Good location. Very clean. Nice staff. Like their food especially their pork chop, its really good. MUST TRY !!!"
"The best things about this hotel were the interior design and staff. We only stayed for a few days and technically the hotel was still in soft opening (the bar on the top floor was still under construction, only one elevator was available to use, the spa was still unavailable), but we had a lovely stay nonetheless. The location is at a rather busy street in Seminyak so it gets a bit noisy sometimes. However the location is also great because it's so close to good restaurants, spas and beachclubs. The wifi worked fine. Staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious, and the air conditioning was good. The shower was excellent. Overall it's good value for money."
One of the best location in seminayak. Staff are very humble and friendly. Facilities are amazing. The price is also reasonable.
Ut was great this hotel is fairly new and I just initially booked on night needed up staying 5 nights rooms are clean shower is very good bed comfortable and clean the staff is awesome I only can say good things as I did not find any bad to say I will definitely stay here again
Been here for 2 times and always a pleasure staying here. Great room excellent service with affordable price. Extremely recommended!
"Despite it being the monsoon season, the place was absolutey clean. Gym is currently in the process of being built. Pool was shaded. Location was central to a a bunch of minimarts, cafes, restaurants, massage parlours. Kudeta and Potato Head is a mere 2 mins bike ride away."
Best. Best. Best. Clean room. Friendly staff. Lovely shower since it has shower head & hairdryer. Spacious room. Perfect.
"Good hotel, strategic, and big room. But you can hear a vehicle’s sound from your room."
"(+) The hotel is brand new with spacious room and nicely furnished. The best was comfy. Nice scent of towel. Excellent location in the heart of Petitenget
Value for money. Helpful staff
(-) unfortunately due to pandemic room cleaning only once per 2days and seems limited service (housekeeping room service) available after 5PM and many facilities are closed"
Best location and easier find the food .
"close to the pubs, restaurants and the night scene. Room service was ok (nothing great) but frankly would not need to get room service with such great dining options available nearby - especially the Greek hotel which was great.
recommend getting a scooter on a daily basis to move around Seminyak and even travel over to Jimbaran / Nusa Dua"
Great stay but amenities can be improved. Initial towel is limited to only 2pcs per room but the staff kind enough to give extra napkins.
Love the convenience to be able to walk to many places without calling for rides.
Really good value for money
"With the price and location, it is definitely value for money. The bed is super big"
"This hotel is in the center or Seminyak. Room and design are great. it's really value for money. It's new but unfortunately due to covid, not much occupied. will back here again for sure.. the service team also great!!"
Walkable to Potato Head Beach; surrounded by lots of restos and stores; there’s a nearby hospital and pharmacy. Room is decent.
we stayed here for 2 night. Great location and friendly staff
"The room was clean, bright and good size, aircon worked well and water pressure was good, all were good at this price nothing to complain at all ! Will stay again next time"
"the location is golden, and the price is right, recommended for long stay. 10 minutes away to Cangu or Legian."
"Easy Parking, Great Staff, Spacious rooms with great AC and showers."
"Big hotel, big room. A bit dusty on the floor. The bed is comfortable, no smell, AC is good, water running well. All is good. Unfortunately due to pandemic there seems not much services available (housekeeping, room service) at night. It’s ok tho. Still value for money."
"my room is pretty good , but there are a lots of small ants ,,haha
im not sensitive Person so i can stay here
The staff were friendly and the convenience store was close"
Only downside is the breakfast. I suggest to take the room only as there are great eating places in the area. We stayed there for 7 days and the breakfast becomes extremely repetitive and boring as it’s a small breakfast box with no drink. Rooms and location are amazing!
Hotel is good but towel is not always avalaible
"- staff : really nice and helpful, the have whatsapp to communicate with us
- room : super clean and big! The view i have was pool but also the other family have the view just wall
- area : there are so many restaurant around 1km and also supermarket (pepito) beside the hotel
9/10
Thank you!"
Location is really good. Room was just ok and very humid.
"Pro : room, bed (200x200), location
Cons : hot water, lack of maintenance building, many mosquito in room
This hotel is actually a new building however, perhaps due to covid crisis, it is lack of maintenance. It’s leak on the ceiling at the roof. 
The location is great, going to the petitenget beach is not walking distance, you may take grab for IDR 20k.
Overall, for the price, it is value buy hotel. If you pay same amount yo stay in this area, perhaps you will get worst hotel."
Location in the beart of seminyak. Room are clean and big enaugh
Hotel is very new. Located at very strategic place with restaurants and bar around. Very convenient. Very good place to stay and to get around
Good hotel with nice staff def and also the location near to everywhere hehe
Definite value for money. The only feedback is that the doors close extremely loudly and can wake you up in the middle of sleep. A padded hallway will definitely help. But overall a positive experience with very helpful staff.
Easy and close to the night life
"Everything about this hotel is just right and perfect for my short get away from Jakarta with my wife.
Got a pool access a great price, spacious room (30+m2), comfortable bed, fluffy pillow, nice scent of linen and towel. near perfect location and surrounding. 
Staffs are making best effort to make my stay comfortable. 
Will definitely stay here again next time around."
Good place and beautifull place
"Located in the heart of Bali, surrounded by lots of restaurants, cafe, bar and night clubs. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable."
"It’s a nice play to stay, prime location. Close to bars and restaurants. Absolutely a bargain for the money. Take away the price, it’s a really nice place to stay, I would definitely pay more. I actually can’t believe the price, I’ve been paying so much more to stay close by.
I’m super happy that I found this, also booking via agoda was cheaper than other agents listing the same hotel!"
The staff were so kind and helped us a lot
"Hotel is conveniently located next to mini-mart, cafes/ bakery (opposite)/ coffee places. 
Do expect that you MAYBE will hear your next door neighbours' convo. 
Else, I totally enjoyed my stay and will recommend this hotel!!"
Very clean bed and spacious room. Bathroom is quite spacious with good pressure shower. A little problem with inconsistency in shower temperature whike showering. Parking lot and baaement parking available and not many guests bring car. Next to Pepito supermarket and lots of good restos and cafes within walking distances. Pool in top floor and gym at lobby level are adequate. Nice and hepfull staff. Very recommended for these range of price
"Staffs are polite , kind and helpful . This hotel looks like it is still slowly improving it’s interior . I believe it will improve to be better. The rooms are very not soundproof so not recommended for light sleepers or those easily disturbed by sounds . Generally i enjoyed my stay !"
Newly brand hotel with strategic location.
Unassuming from the outside but perfect inside. Simple and what we need. Worth nore than we pay.
Decent for price. Nice and big . However wall to thin so can hear next door . There are other hotel there which are better in my opinion.  Mix and match when you go bali
It is really nice and the staffs are all helpful. The location is great. I stayed there for two nights. Everything is good.
good service
"A nice hotel. A large room, comfortable, but centralized AC not too cold. kind staff and comple facilities, like gym, pool and SPA."
"The best part of the hotel is bed and pillow, so comfortable that make me feel like home, just a bit far away from beach, other than that, the best! Worth for money!"
"Perfect place to stay in seminyak, with good location. And spacious room!"
great value
Great hotel if you're not wanting to stay in the thick of Seminyak but still close enough to walk there if needed 👍. Only stayed 2 nights as we were moving around Bali quite a bit. I'd stay there again if I needed too. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooftop pool is very nice.
"Great place better then the photo , brand new"
The room condition was a bit disappointing but I cannot really complain because of the price. The location is walkable to most of the main spots in Seminyak.
Noise insulation is not the best. But it’s fair given the price.
"Friendly, humble and very helpful for all the staff. I give four thumbs for Widhi (FO)."
Recommended
This is a relatively new hotel in Seminyak. It is well located near some of the major resorts such as W Hotel and Potato Head. It has all the necessary amenities and the staff are absolutely wonderful. All the staff are so friendly and helpful and will go out of their way by make your stay at the hotel exceptional.
Great new hotel
"I hate to write this since the hotel employees were exceptionally friendly but otherwise I didn’t like the flair of the Hotel very much (would give it 3 stars). The rooms are big, clean and modern but a bit cold and since the hotel just opened it was still not really finished. Facilities were still closed, the pool area poorly designed, no place to sit on the balcony, very poor room service (food). I wish the team all the best for the future though, they did there best!"
"the plus:  the treadmill in the gym was great and the staff were helpful
the minus: I stayed on the first floor with a garden view, actually it was just a balcony with synthetic grass (not really a garden), so for me, it was considered as no view and I didn't like the room with no view (so sorry although I got upgraded room but it was just not my type of the room). I still recommend the hotel if you do not have problem with the view from your room."
"Everything is good, clean, polite staffs, good gym but the room is not soundproof. I heard any sounds made by anyone in the corridor or adjacent rooms"
The hotel is value for money. Staff is friendly and helpful. Clean hotel in all part. Room and bathroom are perfect sizes.
"Only complaint is poor drainage in shower. Otherwise, everything is great"
Very spacious and modern rooms in general. Good value for money and nice pools (rooftop and ground). Gym needs some TLC as some machines didn’t work but good enough to use the rest
Favorite Hotel in Seminyak Area
"Good customer service from staffs at reservations, front office, housekeeping n security.  Many popular restaurants.. cafes were walking distance n supermarrket just next door. 
Stay here for 5 days. 
Do Ask for rooms away from road if you are light sleeper. 
Its noisy even at night  as the glass door can't be soundproof fm room to balcony. My room was located at 4th level facing main road and has good view.  Not sure about other rooms though."
"They still use plastic bottles for free water. . Why not use a bottle in glass. So much plastic use for amenities
Not ecologic"
"5 days stay here , and i like to come back next time for another stay 👍"
"Spacious room with nice contemporary design. Location very good, close to all nice coffee shops, cafes, etc.
Management need improvements, first night when I arrived, found bedsheets & towels has some spot stains, i asked them to change next day but they also has stains, I don’t know whether they did changed or not. The 3rd day I asked them to clean the room for me, they said sorry bcuz of covid they only clean the room every other day, which I’m not happy with it. I didn’t expect you to change the bedsheet but at least make up the room for me and change the towels. In the end they said they’ll make up the bed for me but they didn’t guarantee for new towels, they will gimme new towels if they had extras. I come back to the room at night. They did made up the bed but they didn’t change the towels. One towel which I used in the morning still hang in the shower the same way when I left the room, the other one I throw on the floor in the room was folded nicely and place in the desk, which I suspect it’s not a new one. Bcuz if that is a new one, they will put nicely in the bathroom. And they will change both. Sorry but I just really cannot accept this regulation that your room will be clean every other day and so did the towels. Am staying in a hotel & resort, not a guest houses. 
Oh, this hotel only give you two bath towels, no other towels and only one pillow per bed. I don’t know it’s normal but it’s my first time knowing this"
Very good and worth the money
Best location with cheap price. Awesome. Will definitely stay this hotel while back to Bali
"Spacious room, very clean since it is new hotel"
"New hotel, so many facilities not up and running yet, room is very spacious, and clean very simple. Nice bars and restaurants right up the street within 3 mins walking. Great for price  hard time getting gojek for pick up but I believe it was due to New Years. Hotel restaurants very new food not very good. Breakfast selection was very great and good variety."
"hmm where to start ? this place is a gem to be honest, for the price you pay where this hotel sits in the best location of seminyak. easy accessible to canngu and semiyank area. though this hotel is located on the main road, the rooms are not that noisy.  The room itself is quite big and their bedding is super comfy.I stayed in other pricey hotels such as kanvaz & jambuluwuk, compared to those hotels this hotel is far better for the price you pay. definitely recommended for short/long stay. 
The amenities are bit old  if you ignore them, then its a great hotel to stay"
"Pros: 
1. Clean and large room
2. Next to supermarket
3. Seminyak area is within walking distance 
4. Excellent service from hotel employees 
5. Affordable pricing 
Cons 
1. Gym facilities still under construction 
2. Breakfast taste below average"
It was my first time in Bali and I was traveling alone. The Capital Hotel in Seminyak made me feel welcome and at home throughout my stay.  😊👌
"So there are a number of youngish partygoers staying here who scream and make a lot of noise in the corridors late at night (3am) I woke up hearing screaming, thinking it was a fight but turned out to be drunk idiots mucking about. Think college frat house level noise and residents 🤦🏽‍♂️ also no buffet breakfast but basic brekkie you order the night before and gets sent to your room in the morning. 
Stay here if you like living in a nice room in a frat house. You have been warned."
"It's a new hotel, modern, bright room and larger size than I expected. Very clean. 
The room is not a soundproof, we heard noise from the dog barking from the neighborhood nearby. 
The lobby doesn't look attractive and unwelcoming feeling but overall we were happy with our stayed and it didn't bother us."
Favorite Hotel in Bali
"This hotel location is amazing.. price value for money is unbeatable.
But you need to careful with the bed linen, they might be didn’t change with a new linen.
Just ask for a new linen.. they will provide it.
Other than that, its amazing."
Nothing to complain
"Stay for one nite only during weekend, hotel lobby is very quiet. Only 1-2 staffs. Covid made Bali so empty with tourist. Hotel price become very cheap these days."
"The staff is very good and helpful, the location is perfect. It's maybe not for long stay, but if you want few days i really recommend."
"Noisy at night, since the room has no soundproofing, you can listen clearly if people passing by and talking . Have very noisy neighbours for 2 nights of my stay and cant have my proper sleep"
"Very nice and clean with a good price. The staff  was so friendly, and helpfull."
We stayed here because we love the location! The room is spacious but unfortunately for the breakfast they give us bento and the gym wasn't ready! Hope all the facilities ready soon
The location just in the centre of seminyak and the price is affordable.
"Love this hotel.Location was good.
Room were clean and spacious."
"Huge bed, Value for money, Perfect location"
"Photos are beautiful but the place is not very well maintained. Algae can be found on our soap bottles, stains are on sheets and towels, I also got bitten by mosquitoes during my sleep... you get where I'm going with this.  However, for the price point and the convenient location, this place is great for budget travellers. Hotel service is also fantastic. They are cheerful, friendly and helped me to solve the mozzie issue when I requested."
Good location and value of money
Pretty nice room. Road can be a bit noisy. Breakfast is not very nicely organized.
"Located in petitenget near to the best cafes, coffee shop and the beach. And the staff are very helpful!"
"Hotel is new, room big and clean."
"Pros. Value for money. Staff eager to learn and please. Ni Made was great. location.  Roomy and light.  4th floor room views of urban and greenery nice.  Spa in temporary room location yet massage professionals are first rate.  Great beds, linen and TV + TV channels, in room amenities.
Cons.  It is unfinished and dust, dirt, noise, workman, etc... All a part of the stay.  Where you ask for a clean up the team are fast and responsive to accommodate.  For us this was not an issue and pros outweighed the cons.  Architect we would describe as inexperienced judging by all material choices in construction and finishes and the general setup for pools, gym, rooms, entrance... everything really.  No sound insulation at all between rooms and via door to corridor (you were warned). 
 Again if you come for these things (which we did not) then reconsider here.  If you need somewhere to sleep in between excursions in town and wider Bali it is a good value and newer place less frequented by others."
Cleanliness can be more improve
"We stayed for 2 nights for our honeymoon after we do hotel hopping from Ubud , Nusa Dua, and finally seminyak..
They upgraded our room to suite but they gave us the room which face the road..
At first it doesnt matter until we realized the noise..It’s awful, so I recommend you guys to request for the room which far away from the road..
The air con was well functioning but the bathroom was very slippery..
Overall it was just  okay but next time I may choose another hotel in seminyak area"
Nothing to complain
Not as enjoyable compared to my previous stay. Was abit disappointed as I always enjoy staying here….. overall still alright and would come back again for my next visit…. Hopefully it will be much better than my last stay…
"Hotel was actually good as it is a new hotel located in quite hip area of Petitenget. Room quite big compared to other hotels, big TV, big sized bed. But the cleanliness can be better (maybe because it's during pandemic time, the room felt a bit not too clean - i've got bitten by some kind of bed bugs on the first night), the fan on the bathroom a lil bit too loud, and there are 3 times of fire alarm during my stay there (1st on the NYE at 2am-ish, 2nd and 3rd on 2nd Jan at 7am-ish) but actually no fire. Location is amazing, near many restaurants and hang out places. Staff are also nice."
"The hot water shower was faulty, no room slipers provided"
"Hotelnya bersih, staf ramah, lokasi mudah dijangkau"
Venue is a little out of the way but you can still get to everything and have a good variety of places to choose from around you. We were just disappointed that you had to pay extra for an extra pillow when the supplied pillow really wasn't comfortable. it has a very quiet vibe
Falling appart but cheap and not bad if really cheap
