"We spent the best 16 nights. Starting from the friendly arrival by the people at front desk. Beautiful foyer. Our room with balcony faced the green gorgeous garden, quiet. Aircon worked all the time perfectly. The breakfast was absolutely awesome, (with a view of the ocean).....every type of bread, croissants, spreads, Asian foods. Eggs, bacon and so much more. The service at breakfast is amazing the employees are very attentive and lovely and always with a smile.  Our room was cleaned every day. The cleaners were always cheerful. The 2 pools are amazing (towels provided) and a very short walk to the beach for a swim.  Lounge chairs along the beach and by the pools order food/drinks from the lounge on beach/pool, there is a swim up bar in the larger pool. Could not fault anything on our stay at Prama Beach Hotel. 
10/10. Highly recommended."
"This hotel were always the first in mind when I think about holiday in bali. Maybe this is my 5th time here? And I don’t really think about other hotel, unless they offer better price with same facilities as Prama. 
The hotel might had old feelings, but it has great facilities with reasonable price. Nice pool, clean and comfy beach line, and nice bed. The breakfast might need more improvement, but It’s oke for me ;) 
My kids were also in love with this Hotel. Will be back for sure ;D"
"near the beach,  we can enjoy the sunset while having meal and drinks, the receptionists were very nice, thank you for the upgrading of our room, my kids love the rooms so much, enjoy the room menu and the restaurant menu, not yet try the pool but seems very nice, my daughters love the bacon on the breakfast so early before we go to Nusa Penida, all set ready, so i recommend this place as if they know you are going to Nusa Penida and they try their best to serve you before your trip... thank you so much, all family went with full stomach so we ready to have fun allday"
"We loved this hotel very much. Great location right on the south of Sanur beach. Really easy to run or walk along the beachside.
Two gorgeous swimming pools. One for kids and one for adults. Perfect for family trips or just couples. Many beds on the beach as well. Next to a water sports center with many things to try if you like.
Our room is not too spacious but function well enough. We got our rooms cleaned everyday. Aircon is powerful and bath room is clean. Balcony is with great ocean view if you stay on the high floors.
Breakfast gets a bit boring because we stayed for 7 nights. Could have some changes haha.
All the staff are super friendly and helpful. 
For the price it is with amazing value."
"It's an older hotel and the first room we were given looked tired. We paid $20 upgrade and were given a balcony room overlooking the sea and pool. Certainly worth upgrading to the newer section. 
Extensive breakfast. The beachfront Location with the bamboo bar on the sand means we will return to this modestly priced hotel"
"Had my daughter birthday celebration recently,arrange with the staff, they were very helpful and kind.
A free birthday cake as a complimentary to surprise her when we were having breakfast, she's beyond happy.
The view also great, we even brought a bicycle for my daughter to ride around.
The foods are also amazing.
Will be very happy to back again."
"I can relax easy-lying on the beach whole day and enjoying the sounds of wave. I can jog along the beach every morning and late afternoon without any worries of being catcall by someone.
Though the hotel was a bit old, the location, staff's hospitality, the facilities, the cleanliness even the food are the best!!! 
I saw some renovation are running on the next wing, guess by next year everything will shine like brand new...
Will definitely come back here for another vacation!!"
Nice hotel near the beach. There are many different buildings also there are many options for eating. There are two pools. One for children and another pool os big and good for swimming. There are events in night and beach bar. Very good breakfast and kind staff. I recommend.
"We stayed at the Pram resort 3 months ago and returned last week for another 10 days, stayed in the Club wing and once again very happy with the whole package.  They are working hard to get the property back into top shape after the covid interaction.  Room was good with large TV, bathroom clean and in good order, room serviced daily. Pool is a ripper, huge. Gym is very well setup with just about every piece of exercise equipment you could ask for including a sauna. Location is a highlight, quiet but close to cafes, restaurants on both sides (road and beach) Bamboo bar and Pizzeria are fun and tasty.  With all the above being good, it's the Prama staff that is the highlight, happy and accomadating at all times. Suggest including breakfast in your package, value for money and a great array of food."
"Could not fault in any way. Pools amazing, beachfront amazing, breakfast amazing, all staff very friendly and room perfect. Extended our stay and would love to return one day 🥰"
Book deluxe if you want guaranteed connecting for kids.  The resort upgraded our superior for this reason and were extremely helpful and kind.  Beautiful breakfast.  Beautiful pool.  Best spot on the beach for the ambience.. we don't swim in beach but like beach side.  We will definitely book again!!!  My only negative was the kids club didn't really seem to be happening but perhaps still a post covid recovery in progress
"I NEVER did succeed in contacting them via e-mails. Their email addresses on Agoda app, Facebook, own official website etc. are not available. Even if i got the right ones from Agoda customer service center, no replies from this hotel were there. Plus, the air-conditioned in my room seemed old and cannot make the room cool shortly. The shampoo made my hair too dry and tend to tangle easily. The hotel is big. The menu for breakfast did not change when I stayed there for 3 nights."
"This is a resort with full facilities, just stay relax and enjoy all they have. Delicious breakfast, nice staff, beachfront location, good beach club, nice pool, water splash pool for kids, watersport, short walk to many restaurant, all can you find in this resort"
"Room is nice, food is delicious, ambience is nice, location is great. Pools are nice. Bamboo Bar is great. Stay one night there for transit and want to go back and spend more nights there."
"Good resort, nice facility, staff ,food
 Beach is better than Kuta, less crowded and no garbage in the water as in Kuta beaches. Great for family with kids. Highly recommend for families"
"We stayed at the new building. Room is very spacious and have balcony. Staffs were great, amazing food, and great location too. Will come back again for sure"
"Not very expensive with regards to the beach location, as it was nice and very clean although not cleanest. Good value for money"
"This was a perfect place to stay with our daughter of 4. She loved the slides and the pool , because its a special pool for kids you do not bother other guests. The beach is in de front of the hotel, so easy to acces. The breakfast was super. So many choices. It’s also a walking distance from little local shops, bars and restaurants. All the people in the hotel are really friendly and helpful. Because it’s a huge hotel, it’s not very personal, but perfect for the real holiday feeling."
"Helpful courteous staff, beautiful grounds with gardens, trees, 2 swimming pools (adult and children), good breakfast buffet, good dining (several restaurants) all on a beautiful  private beach with lounge  chairs, towels etc. Club room with balcony  and rainfall shower clean and up to date."
"The pool bar and many restaurants on site have the best staff. Mady, Hady, Charisma and Goona, and all the others. Make for a great visit."
Nothing was to much trouble at the Prama. A great choice at breakfast. Didn’t have any lunch or dinner. Room was very clean. And the price was great
Had such a good experience that we came back again to stay for another 12 days. Best value in Sanur and staff is excellent.  Pools and gym are well maintained. Events every weekend and the area is quiet. We will definitely stay here again next time we come back to Bali.
"Right on the foreshore. Choice of beautiful beach or very large pool... Kiddy pool separate.
Staff amazing, friendly..
 Buffet breakfast lots of choice but same every day.... Rooms a little tired but lots of maintenance going on but nothing that disturbed our holiday.
 Will definitely rebook and upgrade to ocean view."
"I really love staying here because its really worth the price. The location also very strategic. 
My husband, mom, sister, and nephew was very happy because the room very tidy, pool is clean, and the beach in the backyard is very nice.
The staff really nice & helpful.
I will recommend this hotel to my collegue and definitely will come back here soon.
Thank you Prama Hotel Sanur⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"We had a great stay at Prama Sanur! The people and service was wonderful. The property is old but the rooms and facilities were well maintained. Great location as well especially because it has a private beach and it is close to some shops. If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is the perfect place to relax in Sanur that is value for money."
"Very Good Facilities , good and beautiful location, beach front restaurant.  / here is big 5 Star Hotel in Sanur, Private beach front, many building and many room available."
"Five of us stayed here, including two small children, and we loved it! The rooms are spacious, air con works great, staff is friendly, buffet breakfast was fantastic, and the grounds are beautiful. Our kids loved the kids pools, and the other pool is HUGE! We would definitely stay here again."
"It was my first time staying in this kind of full-set resort type of property, but it was a great option. I used to live-work in Bali, but only occasionally in Sanur. On this trip, I brought my ageing mother who prefers quiet areas while being close to me and also my husband who never visited Indonesia before.  We just got married last year abroad without family presence, and this trip is the second time my mother spent time with him. So it was a bonding opportunity for them, while also a ""baby-moon"" chance as I was 5mths long pregnant. Overall, the friendliness of the staff, and the homey feeling of the place have really been able to minimize the stress of bringing new people to new places."
"There were 4 adults and 3 children initially, then another 4 adults joined us overnight.  Everyone was delighted with their rooms.  The family had interconnecting rooms, all set up and recently renovated.  They were lovely.  Our room, not so good, but got transferred to a room that suited us perfectly.  The other two couples got upgraded and were in heaven.
Staff were fantastic and co"
"Didn’t expect much about this hotel at the beginning. After we entered the hotel , the room is totally not bad, the view when having breakfast is stunning, it has a lot of pools. The hotel is very big"
"This was our first time staying at the Prama, however, we had called in to see the location and facilities when last in Bali and we were impressed with what we seen, hence why we made our booking with Prama in May for 13 days.  
The facility is getting closer to what was prior to C-19 every day, however, this does not detract from the excellent service we received.
Thank you Prama - we will be back again!"
"Excellent location for beach view and multinational food and shopping  around walking area.
Best resort for destination wedding !"
"Extremely helpful staff, wonderfull breakfast with view to pools and seaside. nice rooms. pool ist about 50 meters long, very good for swimming. only 500 meters to Warungs outside (recommended:  Baby Monkeys and Massimo)."
Quiet clean best breakfast and friendliness staff in all of bali.Highly recommended. THankyou for making it such a perfect place to go for holiday and revisit beautiful bali. JUlie Walker Aussie👌
"Great grounds with grass, gardens and adult a.s children pools. Good breakfast buffet.  Good room service reasonably priced menu. Great staff. Club room with balcony very nice. Best of all right on the beach with plenty of lounge chairs!"
"Only stayed one night as a stopover to Nusa Lembongan, and we wished we had stayed longer!  Facilities were beautiful and immaculately clean, and the staff were amazing. The breakfast spread was top notch.  Definitely a winner!"
"The hotel was superb but even more impressive was the attitude,  friendliness and attention to detail of all the staff ... u can't go wrong"
"Beds are So comfortable
Staff are so friendly
Cooking class with Chef Bagus was fun!
Pools & food - great! 
All in all - a great place to stay 🏆"
"The Prama  is looking a bit tired now, but everything is neat and clean, the staff are great, the 2 pools are huge, good cocktail selection, great beach bar."
"great position on beach front, upgraded to ocean front suite for very little extra $$. Buffet breakfast great, close to so much - shopping massage, dining. Will definitely stay again."
"Just a few min walk to the beach, great location, clean..really nice hotel.thanks prama sanur."
"Love this hotel.  It has become our favourite.  We have been about five times now.  Love that there are 2 pools.  The main one is huge and the other is great for kids with slides.  Lots of pool chairs around pool and beach, so no fighting over lounges! The breakfast is good.  Had a wonderful massage at The Beach Spa. Bamboo Bar on the beach is great overlooking the ocean for food and drinks.
The only thing I would say is that the pool tiles  need a bit of maintenance.  The hotel is large.  We have stayed in the Krisna wing and that location in the hotel is a good one."
I only stayed for 2 nights after I had come out of a week in hospital and was really quite unwell. The staff were just so lovely and caring and did anything the could to care and assist me. I look forward to going back there again one day under better circumstances to really embrace all their is on offer and to see the beautiful staff again.
"The Prama Sanur is a fantastic hotel. Beach front to watch the sunrise in the morning, fabulous pools with a special kids pool, restaurant on the beach, extremely comfortable and spacious room with an incredible rain shower and withn waking distance to shops, bars, restaurants etc in Sanur. 
Bicycle rental is close by and cheap and Sanur is a really easy place to use a bike. The main road is flat with a cycle lane and there's a pathway for cycling and walking on the beachfront. 
Breakfast was brilliant, lots included to set you up for a good day of relaxation before heading out in the evening for dinner at a close by restaurant. 
Cleanliness can not be faulted, the cleaning staff do an amazing job!
 A very diverse Hotel which I'd recommend this place for solo travellers,  couples and families"
"Great hotel, best location to the beach,..thank you Prama Sanur for make our holiday was so wonderful..."
Top location right on the beach 2 beautiful pools. Beds very comfortable. Bar on the beach & great choice for breakfast. Staff very friendly.
"Overall, it is a good hotel. Everything you wish from a hotel. Clean, friendly staff, tasty breakfast, strategic area. But it would be more pleasure if they set toilet shower, or at least a little water container with dipper as we Indonesian people not used to have only toilet paper. See you again Prama"
"We chose this hotel because its location and it's beyond our expectations. Beach front. They upgraded our rooms. A huge hotel, old but well maintained. They have 2 swimming pools, gardens and some restaurants. Close to other restaurants, local street food stalls, cafes and bars. Breakfast was great. Spacious room. Staffs are nice and helpful. We had a pleasant stay."
"VERY good Location, just few steps to beach and you can walk along the beach, enjoy your holiday"
"Thankyou for  10 wonderfull stay with my daugther. Best regards Karl 
Max service , Fantastic  breakfast, Great location. Staff very kind and helpfull"
"I recommend this hotel. The hotel facilities are complete, the rooms are neat and clean, the hotel area is very spacious. The front is a large garden, the back is a swimming pool area, restaurant, bar and direct access to sanur beach !!!"
My Fav hotel for me and husband
Nice hotel with a warm and friendly services. Highly recommwnded for family holiday
Stayed at the Prama for 2 nights before heading back home after a month long trip. Wish I'd stayed longer. Highly recommend.
"Everything is just perfect!
There is really nothing bad that i can say about this hotel.
The room (we got free upgrade), the facilities, the location, the beach, the pool, the staffs, the ambience, everything is just wonderful.
I really loved every second of my stay in this hotel.
Will definitely coming back here.
This is the best hotel I've ever stayed so far."
"If a person who want to have beach view plus have activity in city, sanur is the best place to stay .
Thank you prama sanur we have a pleasent stay😇😇"
"I've been moving around different locations in Bali for my holiday, the fourth hotel is this Prama Sanur, this hotel is the happiest we stay in,  location, value, helpful staffs, readiness foods and relax beach in the back yard. No fault!  Highly recommend 👌"
"Older building but some rooms have been refurbished and modernised (lots of electrical outlets, etc).
Location is quiet, grounds relatively well-kept during pandemic, good pool, good access to beach, wonderful walking and biking path beach-side. This was a repeat stay"
"when booking online, i always fear that what i see in the photos is not what is actually on site. this time it was perfect and even better than the photos as advertised. Good luck to Prama Sanur Beach Bali Hotel and wishing you the very best!!"
I love breakfast provided in this hotel so I come again this week
Very nice hotel great location the best huge pool everything is a plus great place to stay for families couples are on your own great restaurant no service charge or taxes
"Love this place, staff are fantastic, venue it great location, we will be back"
Super clean rooms and helpful friendly staff
"Fantastic hotel located on the quieter part of Sanur beach. Clean rooms, great facilities and very friendly staff. Would happily stay again."
Old hotel but sufficient maintenance. Room was quite big and the view from balcony is beautiful. Direct access to beach. Many gym equipment can be used and we're the only one using them at that time. Loved it!
"We stayed for 3 nights with group for family gathering. Food was great, room was clean, comfort and enough for each member. Pools are awesome, child and adult have their places.  Staffs are very helpful and friendly. Very recommended for stay in Sanur."
"Friendly staff, clean room, good taste of breakfast.. Not a big room, but enough for us to spend days in hotel and reading books.. Need to update the room interior, while the occupancy is low due to pandemic.."
"Tempat favorite saya & suami, utk quality time berdua."
"Its very big beach resort. Very clean, quiet. Nice room. Only problem we had is not working fridge. We mentioned few times to cleaners about but nothing changed. We had to lest some fruits and water in room not in not working fridge."
"Prama Sanur is a big hotel with great view, staff, facilities and breakfast. I love it❤️"
"Love the hotel
Breakfast amazing, staff very nice
Will comeback again soon"
This hotel was amazingly good value for money
"I have stayed with 2kids (11yo and4yo). Location is great,right on the beach, near  shops and restaurants. Hotel was built in 70s ,which is amazing that is still in quite good shape. Staff is amazing,  welcoming and always there to help. Due pandemic it was little bit let down,but you can see on every step that they are doing their best to fix it.Thanks everyone at Prama ,hopefully we will be back!"
"My favourite Hotel in Sanur so far from the 6 I’ve stayed in staff in Bali are always super friendly but these guys were friendly and always well dressed clean white shirts ironed ect, management really make an effort to get to know and interact with as many guests as possible, great beach which is mtrs from the hotel that you overlook while eating at the restaurant of course there are a few things here and there that could be touched up but that for us is part of Bali’s charm bed was really comfortable"
"Favorite  hotel I stayed during my time in Sanur, Bali. The staff was extremely friendly and excellent service for preparing our stay and welcoming us when we are arrived, even the hotel was very busy with other group.
Near to the beach, and have direct access there, makes us easy to have a great time there.
Pool and restaurant are also easy to access. Will be back again for next trip. Thank you."
"Excellent resort, good food, great staff, we'll be coming back again."
"We were upgraded to a suite, a pleasant surprise. The room was spacious and very clean with full amenities. The food was really fabulous. We ordered room service and it was great customer service. Beautiful hotel"
I had previously stayed at the Prama in a ground floor ocean front room and loved it. Came back this time with my daughter of 3 and partner for our first Bali holiday. We spent our first two nights here and had so much fun we didn't even leave the resort. My daughter loved both pools. The staff were all so friendly. We hope to come back again and stay one day.
Great place. You won’t regret. Staff are super friendly and accommodating. Best pool in Sanur. Just awesome
"Have been staying here since 2003, treat you like family. Great facilities 3-4 restaurants, 2 pools, easy to get everywhere"
This is a great hotel. We have stayed there multiple times over the last 6 years and have never been disappointed. The location is fantastic staff are great and the place is just relaxing.  Maintenance of some of the facilities has dropped a little since covid but none of the essential ones. We would definitely stay again.
Prama is classic Bali hotel on the beach at Sanur. Great pools and room to relax
Beautiful location an older building but such good value . Great breakfast and lovely friendly staff . We will stay again
"price good , hotel a bit old but direct to the beach.  good restaurants. 
Happy to stay there ."
"Though the property is rather old, but everything is clean and facilities are great for family."
"Great  adult and kids pools x3. Lots of neatly trimmed  gardens, grass and trees. Lovely  private beach with lounge chairs. Several restaurants. Good breakfast buffet. Courteous and helpful staff throughout. Club room very nice and up to date. Great stay!"
Best hotel in Sanur area
"Very good,i always choose this hotel if i stay im Bali"
Can't beat the kiddy pool and beach access for this price point. Came back a couple times with my son!
Room decor & children’s pool area is dated & in need of some freshening up but overall it has everything you need for a fun family holiday.  Staff were all lovely & helpful. Push bikes & electric bikes available for hire but not flexible with time or rates. On beach & nice walk-in/cycling path
"We are a young family living in Bali, with a three year old daughter. This place had a bit of all for everyone. The kids pool area is amazing and very safe.. with an adult/deeper pool right next door.
The beach here is clean and safe. The bar has night music. 
Guess the only caution I would have is eating at the restaurant mid day(breakfast is great). A little over priced and small portions.. get out and try some other places to eat. 
Still our favorite get away from Ubud"
Great location on the beach. Staff very helpful. Walkable location to other restaurants and spas.
"Friendly staff, great location"
"Prama is a well established hotel at the south end of Sanur Beach. There are 2 comfortable pools, one for kiddies, another for adults. You have a choice of a few places to eat - breakfast buffet, coffee and cakes, pizza/Italian or a beach side bar. Service is good, staff is very welcoming. Rooms are fine, everything that you need, nothing you don't. Prama is a nice beach vacation whether you live in Bali or not."
nice and clean room. quiet. nice breakfast at the beach. simply wonderfull at affordable price.
".....large pools and extensive gardens.I had a club room.....good size,nice bathroom and balcony with garden view."
Third time staying here and would recommend to everyone.
"The facility maintained quite well, no odd smell in the room, clean and all functioning well. We satisfied with the service and also good breakfast they served."
"Hotel dengan private beach,,, lokasi luas,,, masakan enak,, staff ramah,,, milik Garuda Indonesia woi... Next cek in sana lg"
Old hotel but I got decent deal for 1 night stay. So overall it is value for money. Hotel also let me late check out 1pm.
Day 4 for me and still loving this place!
"Loved this resort and would definitely return! Rooms were clean and staff were so helpful! Location was perfect with great access to beach, restaurants and shopping. The public interior areas were a bit dirty and dated but, I did notice the facility is putting in new carpets as well as some exterior maintenance and repairs. No doubt some post-Covid upkeep being completed. Great place for the price!"
perfect place to stay with family
"landscape and facilities it's the Best,,speechless"
Prama currently has very good rates. Resort a little dated but very clean and staff are lovely.
"The room was good. However, some items were not working or not working properly on arrival: room telephone not working; wifi was weak and not possible to open apps (although it was fine in the lobby); and the TV or remote were not working (maybe batteries were finished). Only the TV/remote was eventually fixed."
"Price for value, an old hotel but they are trying their best to make it comfortable and looks new. We also got a room upgrade because our previous room AC not working well."
"Bigarråer hotel with many facilities on a nice strech of the beach - but hotel needs some face-lift beeing a bit old. If u get a great price deal just go for it!
Friendly staff, especially housekeeping!"
Good choice to apend your holiday
"Staff serve whole heartedly, give their best. My hubby n I thoroughly enjoyed the pool, beachfront, and will return again next year!"
"Great Location, love the pool, private beach"
Sitting at the beach front Prama Cafe is so relaxing
"We had a good stay and a good deal.
Our bathroom was small but fine. Corridor carpets very old and stained.
Fabulous pools and right next to the beach.
Breakfast was very good and nice semi outdoor location."
"Chose this hotel to stay in over Nepyi day - was great. Large grounds with great pools. Good area for kids swimming.
Good location with plenty of local eats close by.
Our deluxe garden room was large enough and comfortable.
Breakfast was fantastic- lots of choices.
Would stay here again."
"Staff so friendly
Near the beach
Worth it"
Very friendly staff in a great spot
"Very convenience place for your relaxing time. Near to restaurants or little night  market. Very nice swimming pool and nice view for relaxing in the hotel.  
But It’s very good and not worth if u going around the whole day and only for sleeping."
Nice place especially for the kids to enjoy in pool for water games
"Great spot, always good stay. Been coming back since 2001"
"I have stayed at Prama Sanur Beach Hotel multiple times. Every time they have been professional , courteous, and extremely helpful!"
