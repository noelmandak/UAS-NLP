"Nice and clean boutique hotel with helpful staff. Great location on Legian street, where you can get variety of local and international food easily.  Souvenirs, massage as well as bars are all within the vicinity of the hotel. Kuta beach is also within walking distance where you can learn to surf or just chill by the beach, take a dip or simply enjoying the sunset. Clean and big room with nice surrounding, pool and garden. High recommend!"
"Located in heart of legian street. Kuta beach is 10 mins walking distance.  Restaurant, bar and streer food can access easily by walking. Staff is super friendly. Room is clean and spacious. The pool is a plus. Really love the ambiance of the garden."
"In the heart of Legian, not too far from touristic spots(seminyak/kuta).
The services are good, friendly staffs, quite environment, although the appliances/furnitures are pretty old it provided 3 nights of comfortable stay for me. Will be back for sure."
"Whenever I travel solo I stay at this hotel. Have stay numerous times already,  stay again in may and nov/dec. Beautiful hotel and and wonderful staff who always make you feel welcome. Location is perfect. Lots of restaurants very close by."
"The 14 roses used to be good and now even better with an extra pool new rooms and staff that go well and beyond to make your holiday awesome. Any queries I had got sorted in minimal time with no fuss,  This hotel is not a concrete jungle it has grass and lovely pools. No swim up pool bar so less chance of people peeing in it, but u can still order food and drinks to the pool area"
"With a range of rooms starting at around $20/night, there's no shortage of choice. I chose a spacious super deluxe room overlooking the pool, with it's own separate lounge area. Bathtub at one end of the bathroom, full shower at the other end... don't always find that in this budget. Special shout out to the terrific staff, and in particular ADI who will do anything to ensure his guests have a great stay. Oh and the perfect location. Oh and the beautiful pools..."
This hotel located at the main street of legian.Next to it has restaurant Warung Mina that served local indonesian and western cuisine which is delicious.There's live music on the weekend.Near to everything such as convienient store/burger king and all the nightlife pub within walk away.In terms of the room mine is a bit outdated with the bathroom feels like in 90's.There a lot of mosquito as well other than that the room/bed is alright.Staff were nice and helpful and there's 2 pools that you can swim into
"If you must stay in Kuta, then this is a good place. The price is low, the hotel is large, they have food if it rains outside. The location is good, walking distance to nightlife. They have friendly staff to fix any problems you may come across."
"Very nice location, and room are totally excellent,"
I stayed at Fourteen Roses Boutique Hotel for a week. It was really good. The staff was very helpful and friendly.
A very nice stay and love the people . Location 10 of 10 and loved the hospitality
"Staff were very helpful, the rooms were clean, breakfast was good 
Overall we had a memorable experience at the
Special shout out to Egi for being a wonderful host"
"klau ke bali selalu stay disini murah, good facilities and good location"
"Good hotel in legian,gak mauu pulang,bikin betah,ambil tipe suite homi bgtt"
Best place to chill and relax… Nice and affordable price for tourists… also city centre near to shopping and beach
"Great spot great Hotel and whilst the team are new they went out of there way to help all the times…
We had a Suite which was lovely…"
"Had an amazing time at the fourteen Roses. The staff were the friendliest of people and would do anything to help make your stay more enjoyable. 
The location is great. Right on the Main Street with many great places to eat super close by. 
The only real downfall of the hotel is there is no bar open. It’s so lovely to have a swim and be able to get a cocktail or something by the pool but this option was not available. Was very hard to get any drink by the pool. I am sure this will change in time as Covid obviously plays a massive factor. But that was the only real let down we faced. 
We stayed in a 2 bedroom room and a suite above and they were well worth their money. Great location and the suite upstairs overlooked the pool and was huge! The baths were massive! Big rain shower. Cannot complain at all about the rooms or the price we paid. 
Having two pools was great, the one downstairs gets lots of shade which is great for the kids - plus it also has a kid area. The one upstairs isn’t super deep but gets lots of sun and is lovely too. Maybe they will open the bar up there one day soon too. 
Would definitely stay again in a heartbeat."
"2 room n 2 bathroom, very spacious. Its at L1 n very quiet. Only thg I don like is water flow frm e pipe has super strong sewage smell... i hv to let it flow for few min n e smell goes off. please use e bottled water when u want to brush teeth."
"Our group stayed at 14 Roses Legian hotel for four nights. We had a pleasant stay at the modern deluxe rooms. The hotel doesn't offer a variety of breakfast but there are lots of restaurants surrounding.  The staff were friendly and helpful. It is a safe, green, cute, and nice place to stay in the center of hustle bustle of Kuta. The beach is within walking distance through the back alleys where there are lots of cute small shops and cafes offering a variety of services, meals, and goodies. 
Will recommend this place to fellow travelers."
The staffs are quite nice and friendly. The place is nature friendly. It was cozy.
"The renovations have made this hotel a beautiful place to stay, close to everything  and very cheap"
Good place to stay in Legian st if your looking for a bit of peace and nature in this busy area
The hotel is in the middle of kuta which is kind of busy but you will love it! The only thing lack is they dont provide iron :(
"If you're looking for a true taste of Bali and value for money Id highly recommend Fourteen Roses Legian. This is a gem amongst the hustle and bustle of Kuta/Legian. Recently renovated to a high quality in a modern Bali style, you'll enjoy the peaceful ambience that this hotel offers."
I have stayed at this hotel 5 times. The staff are beyond helpful and always say hello. Have stayed in 3 different rooms in my 5 visits and my latest room is the newly built rooms absolutely beautiful room. I'll definitely be staying here again. The location is great right on legian St. 2 restaurants either side of entrance 😀 Please book you won't be disappointed.  Ps 2 pools
Love this place so much. I recommend this! The staffs are very nice. 💖
everything is good about this hotel
Had a great time at 14 roses def stay there again with my family
"Hotelnya bersih banget, interior bagus bgt warna nya soft bgt desain hotel baguss pokoknya"
Saya ambil family room....bagus bgttt kerennnn....staffnya jg sgt ramah
they gift cake for my kids birthday!
"Lovely hotel just needing their restaurant to open which shouldn't be too long.  The staff were amazing and so pleasant, nothing was too much trouble for them.  I'll definitely be using this hotel as my regular from here on out."
"Overall the condition is 10/10. The hotel is near 24h marts, starbucks, shops to buy souvenirs etc.
Everything is great here! Definitely would stay here again.
Do wait for us next year!🥰🥰😊😊😁😁"
"Hotel in the heart of all the action of Legian Kuta.
Great Pools friendly staff..
Only negative Breakfast is JUST ok nothing special.."
"Hotel stuff is friendly, the pool is nice."
"The best part of this hotel is location and more importantly the staff, they are great and always do their best to satisfy guests. The downside is the wifi which is unreliable and the room I was in needs improvement. Stain on the ceiling in the room does not look good, the cupboard needs to be fixed, and the mirror in the bathroom has some marks and need to be removed. Will I come back? Just because of location and great service from staff otherwise no. Just for feedback, cafe at the back has good coffee and if there is a TV for people to watch like sports, this will increase traffic and more people coming"
"very good location, service, 2 pools up and down. love this place!"
"Great location 
Money changers out front an back trustworthy 
Friendly  staff
Clean rooms"
"We love staying here, friendly staff clean rooms and beautiful ambience."
"Excellent location and amenities. great value. Spacious, clean airconditioned rooms. Will definitely be back."
We only intended to stay two nights as our preferred hotel was unavailable. However we extended our stay and the hotel and location are both great. Will definitely be back
Good. Position and close ever thing was not problem for the staff would go back again
Great value for money
"Stay there 29-31 Dec 2019
Room with 3 single beds. 
Cons: 
Only stairs as it has 3 floors. Keep in mind for heavy load luggage although bell boy do come assist.
Should have a tag door label Do Not Disturb/Do not makeup room. Theres a switch for it but once the key pull off it doesnt light up.
However, i do enjoy the short stay, as the location & walking distant to the main road Legian.
Thanks to all staff."
Hotel was great location was good staff so friendly and helpful just all round  great place really
"Nice surroundings, helpful and nice staff, big rooms and great location."
Suite was great
"Warm,friendly welcoming staff and always very helpful.Quiet accommodation although right on Legian Street,Fantastic location and short walk to the beach with a selection of good restaurants near by.
Older rooms getting a little dated now although still very comfortable and affordable. New rooms recently completed,larger and more modern.
Massage spa on property for a very good and relaxing massage and treatments.
Yes i would recommend Fourteen Roses and my self would return."
Friendly & helpful staffs. Beautiful & serene surroundings. Big room & value for money :)
"Love the 2 pools and gardens. New rooms are great. Good location on edge of Kuta. 
My 2nd time here (2018 & 2022). 
Website room names & types are confusing though. There’s a lot of old and new."
Amazing affordable hotel. Beautiful little pool area!! The rooms are clean. I will definitely be back here!. The location is perfect
"This was our 1st trip to Bali so we were not familiar with the location. The hotel staff were lovely, friendly and helpful and the facilities good.  Location is quite central to town, if that is what you are looking for.  Bali has clearly struggled over the past couple of years and many properties are run down or closed. The staff are clearly working very hard to make guests comfortable and our room was very spacious and clean. We had some issues with shower fittings not working but this is an older property and we were able to use the bath and hand shower so didn't feel the need to make an issue of it. I would happily stay here again if I wanted to be close to the Kuta area. They are relaxed here so we used the pool day and night. We noticed that some of the bigger name hotels closed their pool areas at 7pm. Overall a great value hotel. The onsite spa is also pretty good."
Cheap but classy. Will come back for sure. Thanks
Second time i stayed here.  I like atmosphere in the gardens and the pools.  Very central location and the staff is very polite. I will stay again
"Very kind and friendly staff,
Much appreciated for grateful customer service 🙏"
We stayed at family suite the room is so big.beautiful garden and staff very friendly n helpful.
"I had the double room for 35USD per night what more can I ask for?
It already included breakfast. Not a lot of choices but fruits, vege salad, noodles, rice, chicken, grilled or mixed vege, eggs, bread etc are good enough for me.
It is in a busy location. The hotel lobby has a relaxing feel because it has a big sitting area. They have 2 nice pools which are surrounded by a lush garden. 
The downside for me is they had put me in the block above the dining area that only has stairs. Going up and down 3 flights wasn't easy for my aunt. The other blocks had elevators but we couldn't transfer because the hotel was full.
Nice cheaps shops around the area. Exactly across fourpoints sheraton kuta. You can do a leisure walk and see things in shops on yhe way to beachwalk mall and kuta beach. Opposite is the Legian beach 
the towels are not absorbent and don't smell fresh. They should wash thoroughly."
"The hotel is located in the Legian Street of Kuta. Easily walk near the clubs, grocery store, shops etc. The property is beautiful with lots of greenary, Bali vibes, kind and humble staffs always willing to help, value for money. Totally Recommended!!"
Highly recommended! The only down side is elevator is not working during our stay so we need to carry our bags from ground floor to 3rd floor and vice versa. Breakfast menu is the same for the whole 7 days of our stay. It's quite disappointing.
nice location
The room was perfect and clean. The pool area is also nice. Make sure to also get a spa treatment!
By far the nicest room I have stayed in while in bali
Great Location central to everything lots of great restaurants next
"Sempat ada masalah dengan AC dan shower buton,tapi over all its nice place to stay"
"upstairs and downstairs pools are really chilled. Rooms are good size, water pressure a little soft, location is great with 2 ways in, one to the street and one to bensari lane close to good food and bars would recommend a stay here"
Great hotel to stay
"Beautiful establishment big space of garden , beachfront bar restaurant, peaceful atmosphere. Perfect for relaxation."
Spacious rooms with fridge and safe. Shower with very hot water ang great water pressure. Small balcony with no view the garden was amazing. The staff was great.
"Very friendly, 2 beautiful pools, food st the restaurant was good quality, fresh and value for money."
"All the staff  there are first class. Nothing like relaxing on a pool-side lounge, absorbing the restful ambiance while letting the serenity float you away."
"Nice hotel, some rooms need bit tlc but still OK. Staff very nice and good breakfast. Lovely pools and gardens."
We have been to Bali 40 times and rate this hotel as the best value for money.
Good for a night or two while you get your bearing. Some good places to eat and drink in walking distance.
"Pleasent helpful staff, easy check in.
Value for what I paid. Did not try food but looked good value.
Room large enough but no view . TV cable but reception was not good and no English program. Sheets and pillow cases looked a bit Grey but seemed clean . Smell from drain when running shower. Convienient location but hastled by massage girls every time left or returning to hotel."
as always meet smiling people 😊
"Comfortable and happy, staff are amazing"
Mix of old and new in popular area close to the beach and popular bars
"Everything fine, only the breakfast organisation could be better (at certain rush times no tables and no plates/cups available) - but really friendly staff !"
"Pro: Near to Kuta town. Nice staff, pool clean & got hair dryer
Cons: Aircond warm even already change the temperature .
Overall nice play to stay."
I love my stay here with my friend
"Only plus point is superb location.
Everything is within walkable distance.
Rooms are bit small with congested bathroom.
No hand wash in bathroom, when checked with the receptionist, was asked to manage with shower gel :-)
Even though in amenities it is mentioned free bottle water, they provide only 2 bottles per day. Don't bother asking for another one :-)
They don't provide any power adapters, please carry your own."
"Suggest paying the extra 7 to 10 dollars to get pool view room with balcony as the other options are a bit below standard.
Great staff and location when staying in Kuta."
"Kuta was awful for being harrassed by men and we had one man (guest) from the hotel try to follow us into our room and then bang on the door, staff moved us to a different room for safety and we’re very friendly, first room was damp and the wifi wasn’t good (116) but second room (216) was clean, dry, AC worked well and wifi was much better, would recommend but be careful"
"Water pressure was so slow to shower. Aircond was old and lack of maintenance, so the room was stuffy and warm. Need a lot of improvement and maintenances for the hotel. Management please take note....."
"Rooms are good, some of them are a bit old but the surrounding / garden is very green 
Then are in reconstruction so some part are bit noise, but its fine.
Staff is welcoming and here to help.
Good atmosphere, and lots of cafes/ bars .. around as it is on the Main Street"
We can hear the sounds from nearby party as  well as noice from the room next to ours. The bed linen and pillow cases aren't that clean as well :(
"I had not good experience here. Hotel provided us the room what was not match my booking. I booked large bed and smoking room, but they provided me the room with 2 small bed and nonsmoking, even I had paid. They explained that full booking that day. I could not sleep well . Their solution was free breakfast but it was not delicious breakfast with me. Bathroom had bad smell"
"Hotel is a budget hotel, however the the money cant go wrong. Breakfast Buffet wasn't great."
"I was stayed with my friends for 2 nights. When We were check-in at the hotel one front staff, I guess she is a manager on that shift. She was so rude to us we tried to explained about the booking situations but she dosen’t tried to understood and did bad behavior. But hotel is ok to stay, breakfast not good."
Close to everything beautiful staff value for money . Would definitely stay here again
"It was ok for the price
Gardens so nice
 Very Balinese."
Worse experience. Ask to change room as the toilet leaking and shower not working. Then they move us to another room. Another room was super hot. Air cond not working. And we went out to the walk at the street expecting when we are back the problem solve. BUT THE ROOM STILL HOT. TOTALLY NOT FEELING THE AIRCOND. !!! We tired to chnge again the room and they also said they are fully booked. One more. The new room they gave us. The toilet so dirty and smelly. U can even feel u are stepping on mud.
Good hotel nice lokation good swming pool nice staf
"Rooms were tired. Not particularly clean. The staff were very friendly, but a little slow for the check-in. But good overall for the price"
nice hotel but they will try to putu in a room of their choice checkuget what ubook  lookat the room
"The cheapest rooms avoid like the plague... the balcony is unsafe the furniture has nails sticking out and is falling apart. 
We upgraded the room based on this and even though it was only $3 a day more online they wanted $10 a day, which brings me to check out time where they demanded that i owed them $350 for the room upgrade not $90 that we were originally quoted. 
The upgrade was ok nothing amazing the sheets smelt like petrol as well. 
The breakfast is $10 per person including that price per small child so we didn't bother eating there. 
The staff cannot speak very much English and at times are quite rude my 5 year old wanted to tip some of the workers and they laughed at him when he gave them 20,000rp each. 
The only good thing about this place is the location"
Great location beautiful pools and lovely staff
"I asked for a queen bed and got 2 single beds.  On the 1st day of breakfast there was hardly any food we had to wait for the 1 and only waitress to bring out clean plates and cutlery. There was another quest who was sitting at the table on a wooden chair, his chair broke and the staff did nothing about it. 
The cleaners forgot to clean my room 1 day and I had no hot water.  We only stayed here because the other hotels we usually stay at were booked out."
"1st booking by online.when rch the room. I'm sooner faint.  Mosquitos alot and fly died and dried on top the bed.
Smelly and not comfort.  I ask change room but they reject . The staff said need to add payment for upgrade room. I do paid idr 250k for more comfort its ok.but 2nd times im dissapointed. The shower water is brown and nvr stop brown even waiting 30minutes. And i complaint ask change room. I do paid for brown water? Another room i get but no bathtub .i do paid bathtub room. The same case brown water nvr stop flow . Ends up with dissapointed and we give up and its almost 1hour + . The staff settled nothing.and wasted my rest time. Decide No shower after wholeday busy outside.  The compensation cause no bathtub is 2pax breakfast. But its still not make my dissapointed gone. But it more worst.cause the meal also cold and not fresh at all. ..
Actualy environment is special. Just need handling and checking bfr recommand to guest. Hopefuly my comment can make more good improvement on next trip."
"tv fuzzy can't watch it , shower broken, air cond not working . moved room , air cond not working again, had to sleep in a hot horrible room every night , safe not working, this place is terrible from the minute you arrive . avoid it"
"I have been going to Bali for 13 years and have stayed in may hotels, this hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.
They gave us a room with single beds and I booked a king bed. 
When I rang down they sent someone up to fix it so he just pushed the beds together and told us they would give us another room the next day.
When they changed our room it was only a double bed and our view out the window was was a brick wall.
After that we had three days with no hot water in the shower, so on the 3rd day I had enough and told them we were going to another hotel.
Then they wanted to give us their best room in the hotel, but I said no I have had enough and we left."
I think they gave me the budget room. A bit smellie. Must of been a big air con out side very noisy all night.
"I have stayed at the Fourteen Roses on a couple of occasions. All those times the staff have been very accommodating, friendly and efficient. The Superior room although spacious is very basic. The shower in my room did not work so I had to use the hand shower while crouched in the bath. There was also an unpleasant odour from the sink and bath. For the tiny difference in cost I definitely recommend going for the Modern Deluxe room instead. Although a little smaller in size they are infinity more comfortable even down to the ambiance lighting. Very comfortable, excellent shower and bathroom. Highly recommended. Breakfast at the Fourteen Roses is more than adequate, a range of both Indonesian and continental breakfasts are on offer with the eggs cooked to your preference. Would stay here again in future."
"If you are the type to get Massage Everyday and food nearby by walking distance, Roses Legian is the choice for you. Not too far from food and Live band. But you have to be careful of your booking. Because when we go there , they have 2 different sets of rooms. The first one they show me when i book base on the price offer was a bed frame of old room and not furnish at all. Looking old, and dusty. Then the hotel staff will asked if you want to upgrade , you will need to top up for the other nicer room. The pictures there, not so genuine. But after paying and being upgraded, it looks much more like a room and more comfortable!  The staff, were nice people. Generally, Bali People Makes you Fall in Love with Bali. Very helpful. The Breakfast was nice..... Keeps you full!!!!"
"Great stay at the fourteen roses, easy check in with friendly and helpful staff. Room was nice and modern and cleaned every day. Great location (just off the main strip) hotel was quite and the restaurant was nice. Had lunch and dinner a couple of times and was pleasantly surprised. Pool area was a tad small and quite shaded but only a short scroll to the beach. Can't complain for the price we paid! Thank you for a memorable holiday fourteen roses!"
"I only spent one night at Fourteen Roses Legian Hotel, but it was a great place to relax and take a rest my first night in Bali. It was only 70,000 Rupiah to get to this hotel from the airport also! My hotel room was very quiet despite being on a bustling street. Would recommend Fourteen Roses for a comfortable and quiet stay in Legian."
"Stayed at Fourteen roses Legian for 3 nights. Picked up from airport and our driver took great care of us. All staff were wonderful and service was amazing. Pros were the pool, massage/spa, breakfast and environment. Cons were shower and bathroom was poor. However would highly stay again, never wanted to leave. Beautiful hotel."
"I was very impressed  with the Fourteen Roses. 
For a person who has never stayed out of Sanur  ,
It was wonderful,  So central to everything.  If you are walking. 
All the restaurant's around are wonderful, 
If you choose to stay at Fourteen Roses you would enjoy your stay the staff do 
Go out of their way to make you feel welcome,  I will be going back"
"We were welcomed into Fourteen Roses and treated as family. The rooms were large and open, could do with some chairs on the balcony. Special mentioned to Julie & Raymond, they were the kindest staff I've ever experienced in Bali!"
"I have stayed in Bali 3 times and usually go to another hotel. This time I tried Forteen Roses in Legian. Honestly, it cost me $380 for 8 nights, had a good pool for my little one and I and I later realised there was another on the next level. Breakfast wasn't very good so next time I won't have it included as we will go out instead and my 3yr old broke a plate which the hotel charged me $5.00 for. Apart from that and a few minor issues (No hot water but staff fixed quickly), the location was amazing for me, it was quiet, and staff were absolutely lovely. I'd stay there again for the price. At the end of the day, how much time do you spend in your room in such a beautiful place? If you aren't a fuss pot it's fine"
"Absolutely lovely hotel with very friendly and helpful staff, still under renovation, will be even more beautiful once complete, small in size which is wonderful but still has tropical feel with gorgeous grounds and garden, two small pools, decor and atmosphere is lovely. Basic breakfasts, very clean and daily cleaning by staff is great, always happy to help if you request anything. Great location on Legian Street, accessible from both Legian street and back road, mini marts right out front and laundry available across road on Legian Street. Located within walking distance to many restaurants, markets and many shops for shopping, also walking distance to beach. Small car/ scooter parking at front of hotel. Highly recommend as great priced, lovely hotel."
"Accidentally booked this hotel thinking it was the 14 roses beach hotel. The location is in the heart of Legian, but you couldn't hear any of the noise/traffic in the room which was surprising and a relief. Pool was great, wifi in room. Was hoping for a fridge (the 14 roses beach hotel has a fridge). Besides that, all good!"
"We stayed in a classic deluxe room and it was clean and tidy. the staff are very helpful. The breakfast is very basic but sufficient. There where a lot of renovations happening but it wasn't noisy. 
We have stayed at the Fourteen Roses a few times and have always enjoyed our stay."
"I stayed in the new section of Fourteen Roses just 1 night. It is clean, modern, comfortable beds. Good value for money. Breakfast was good choice. Staff were very accommodating with your needs. Pool was nice to relax by."
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fourteen Roses.
In particular, the staff at reception were most helpful and friendly.
Hotel has plans for renovation which we will look forwad to.
Rooms too dark at night to read.

Breakfast location noisy with traffic at timesand perhaps more promotion of what is on menu."
"Love the Fourteen Roses in Legian. Hidden, quiet but close to everything. Good staff and nice pool"
"I always stay at the hotel and it is always amazing I prefer the modern delux as it has a rainfall shower, rooms are always so clean and the boys that work at the reception are more than accomodating and always make our stay more and more memorable each time. 
Raymond the older man that works by the pool is really the only reason we stay at this hotel, he is amazing so kind and always makes us feel so welcome. 
Anyone that stays at this hotel should defiantly go out of there way to meet Raymond he is just the sweetest thing.

Unfortunately this trip ended on a bad note, when checking in to the hotel they offer a free 10 minute massage in the ananta spa next to the pool, so I waited until the last day .. My 10 minute massage lasted 4 minutes. In all my trips to Bali I have never come across a lady so rude in my life. I really hope next trip this lady is no longer working at this hotel as she has now completely turned me off staying in this hotel. Just the perfect way to rewen my holiday.  Do not use the free 10 minute massage as you will also probably end up in the same upset way that I did myself.
Once I find out her name I will be making a formal complaint. As she does not deserve to work in this hotel with such a rude attitude "" her exact words was I'm not rude this is my character"". Well your character does not belong in this lovely hotel. 
Extremely disappointed."
I always stay at Fourteen Roses but was very Disappointed this time they were renovating and all u could hear at the pool was jackhammers and loud power tools when I complained they just laughed and said we are renovating. U couldn't even relax by the pool it was so loud. May not stay there again in the future. They could at least warn the guests about the renovating and noise so we aren't blindsided when we get there. Could even use the spa by the pool as not relaxing getting a massage and listening to jackhammers at the same time. Extremely disappointed this time
"I stays in this hotel for 6 days the hotel itself located on legian street which is very easy access to the Restuarant, Mini mart, ATM, shopping area, Club, Pup ect but the hotel rooms set back about 100 mater from the street which means it's quiet and peaceful in the middle of city. Room is very spaciouse with comfortable bed, lovely swimming pool best value for what I paid for.
Staffs are friendly and very accommodate. I had a late departure but they were very kindly to gave me a free late check out I'm very grateful, thank you very much for a great stay.
Love this hotel and diffinately will come back."
"we stayed there in total 10 days first 4 days and then 6. The location of this hotel is amazing, quite close to everything. beach 10 min. legian party street 5 min. Recommended for all different kinds of travellers.
I will always stay there again, if i am back on bali"
