Slightly dated hotel but great value for money and the pool is lovely! Nice and quiet with good shuttle to beach. Room was huge and very clean and staff were lovely.
"Spacious room and bathroom, huge bed, very good facilities and super helpful and friendly staff! Breakfast options could be improved, but it would only matter if you stay with picky kids and for a longer period. All in all it was really great for our stay!"
We stayed at the Grand Bali Nusa Dua for 5 days. It’s a good hotel with a very good service. Marsha at the reception gave us the best welcome you can imagine. Driver Putu brought us everywhere very safe. At the beach club the service was great by Ayuk and the staff.
This hotel was perfect for my young family. The room was huge and more than enough space for us. The hotel was a short walk to the shops. The shuttle to the beach was great. Breakfast options was average but perfect for the little ones. I’d definitely recommend this hotel.
3 days 2 night never enough for us to stay here. room with pool access is compulsory . easy to go breakfast & swimming . feel like home. the toilet is so amazing & jaw drop. spacious toilet is the best thing for me when travel. very clean & nice place to stay for indoors people.
"Very clean hotel with super friendly staff. The private beach is amazing and the swimming pool area is relaxing and quiet. At the moment there are not many guest here. Love the free beach and Bali collection shopping district shuttle running every two hours. Don't forget to tip the driver sometimes, that makes them happy 😉"
"Not only is this hotel in a great spot for waking to do a bit of shopping or awesome restaurants but the hotel itself is just beautiful. The staff go above & beyond all day everyday! 
The rooms are clean & large with everything you need on hand. We will be back"
"We were staying in one bhk private villa, the villa was spacious, ventilated the staff was welcoming we mostly interacted with Marsha, chef and housekeeping staff they were so nice, we were vegetarian so the chef prepared paratha and curry for us. The hotel also has private beach and hourly shuttle for it.Surely I would like to visit the place again"
"Spacius clean room, daily shuttle to their private beach and Marsha at front desk really took the best care of us during our stay. Will be staying here again!"
Good room & good hospitality recommended for Business and vacation in Nusa Dua Bali.
"Good hotel, complete facility, nice staff. Only breakfast a little bit standard. Thanks."
"Our stay was perfect with the hotel especially the host was very warm and welcoming. 
Special thanks to Marsha for a memorable stay."
Wonderful place with great hospitality.
"A perfect find for our stay near Nusa Dua beach front. We didn't want a big resort beach front hotel so this was perfect. A free 10min shuttle to their private beach area which was really nice felt more private and exclusive than the bigger hotels. A walk into the town was easy and we found a a noice place for food and drink. Hotel and staff were great, it was a little quiet but the pool area and our room  onto it was delightful. Would consider staying again for sure."
"Much better than pictures, beautiful hotel."
Excellent value for money. Lovely staff especially Dika in the restaurant. All went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Only downside is the road outside hotel is being repaired but should be done for the G20 summit in November. Lovely pools and gardens.
Everything is good. Except for that there are slight smell from the wood furnuture.
"A cool, comfortable and spacious room, and a generous, varied buffet breakfast.  Helpful staff."
Nice hotel .. but we noticed some worms in the bedroom and bathroom. The management should do something about it
"The Grand Bali is great value, no doubt principally because it's not on the beach. If that's a must for you, then you'll want to stay in one of Nusa Dua's soulless mega-hotels. However, if you'd like much better value, with friendly staff, lovely public areas and pools without the high price tag then the Grand Bali is for you. Plus, you can walk out of your hotel to cafes and restaurants without having to walk 2km. Oh, and they have a shuttle bus to a private beach club anyway, so really it's hard to see the downside."
"Vicinity to beach, good food options at hotel also good Indian restaurants within 2-3 km range"
"Pros:
-Clean and comfortable beds.
-Beautiful facility
-Ac works well
-Shower water was heated and sheets were clean and some toiletries were provided.
-continental breakfast was provided for free if paid for upon booking.  Breakfast was good and dining area was clean.
-no bugs in room except for an occasional mosquito (it is normal since they are everywhere in Indonesia)
-no cigarette smell in room or sheets or bath towels.
-service was friendly and professional 
Cons:
-Pool could use more cleaning due to algae on walls and leaf litter
-Pool ran out of towels and waited 30 minutes for them to restock
-Spa was closed at 4pm even though sign says they are open until 6pm and was hoping to do a walk in massage.
-Our room Cards didnt work and had to get it reprogrammed 
-Phones in the room had no dial tone and had to get engineering to fix it.
Login and Password changed on us without telling us it chamged.
Billards table is broken and run down
Cue sticks not maintained and no chalk"
"Bed and pillow are comfortable. I have a good sleep.
Breakfast, Even not much variation, but food taste was delicious. 
Spacious room."
"We Really enjoy our time, the staff so friendly, the food is good, we got free upgraded my kids enjoyed so much, we hope the pandemi will over soon so the hotel can have their best maximum loaded again, thanks Agoda and The  Grand Bali Nusa Dua Resort ❤"
Lovely hotel lovely staff and nothing is too much trouble
She is a grand old Bali hotel in need of a makeover. My stay was far from ideal. First problem.  Gave my room away. Second problem when I argued for another room. It smelt like a men's urinal. Third problem. I was promised a breakfast box on early departure at 6:30am. Never received.
"it is an old facility, weird smell in the room"
"We stayed 10 nights at The Grand Bali Nusa Dua Resort and had a fabulous time. The staff are wonderful and will do whatever they can to accommodate your every need.
We had a very spacious room with an amazingly large bathroom and very comfy beds.
The breakfast was very good although we have stayed in other hotels in Bali where there has been more choice, however saying that for a small hotel we never went hungry and had a good fill to start the day.
The beach is very peaceful with plenty of beds and umbrellas or shaded areas and the transfers to and from the hotel to the beach only took 10 minutes which was absolutely fine.
I would certainly stay at the Grand Bali Nusa Dua Resort should we return again to Bali and would definitely recommend it to family and friends"
"Our stay at the Grand Bali Nusa Dua Resort was exceptional. We booked the two bedroom villa with a private pool and were so pleased with the accommodations. In fact, we never even entered the main resort pool, because our family preferred the privacy of our villa area. We loved the breakfasts, and the trip via shuttle to the beach was only about 5 or 6 minutes...every hour from morning until evening. We will definitely stay at the Grand Bali Nusa Dua again!"
"We  enjoyed our stay at the Grand Bali Nusa Dua . The service was outstanding . After we checked out , we walked around the town and came back a few hours later because they were holding our luggage. We then asked if there was a bathroom nearby where we could change since it was so hot. They went above and beyond and offered a shower for us for free.We were floored when we saw how beautiful the room was .  We didn’t know there be a fountain . This private pool villa was not as private as others we stayed in . Could be viewed by other rooms above.Some holes in the roof by our private pool. There was also a lizard in our room  The room was very clean and actually smelled of strong bleach . Breakfast was delicious and changed daily . The location is outside of the Nusa Dua gates which we actually loved . Nusa Dua itself is too manicured and doesn’t feel like Bali . This hotel was close enough to the market stands and traditional restaurants to make it feel more Authentic Bali ."
"The hotel is a little more pricey then other accommodations in Bali but a very good price for a resort in Nusa Dua. It’s outside the “resort area” of Nusa Dua but this was not a problem for me. I liked the hotel and what they offered, the breakfast was good and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for someone who wants to stay at a resort but doesn’t want to pay resort prices.  Also my wife says the spa was amazing."
"We had an amazing stay at this hotel, the rooms are large, the pools are lovely, breakfast was varied and a great selection of food. The staff are perfect hosts without overdoing it and their English is good. Even the guy that cleaned our room was super helpful and genuine with it.
The beach is quiet because this area of Nusa Dua is pretty much closed to all but guests of the various hotels.  It's beautiful too, but note that it's not totally private, presumably because most beaches cannot be exclusively owned by a hotel. The sunbeds in the hotel's area are free to guests & priced above the reach of most others, so whilst there are not loads there should be enough available; also they are all shaded. There is a hotel bar on the beach & security guards to keep an eye on things.
We booked last minute and got a great deal so we were super happy. The only thing we struggled with was the bed, the matress and pillows were very firm, even by Asian standards ."
"Friendly staff, very polite people. room is big and clean . the price and location is value 4 money. We were so happy and enjoyed.  Any one want to go holiday the first recommendation is the grand Bali nusa dua resort ."
"Grand Bali-Nusa Dua is a premium hotel with affordable rates. Located at a quiet area but with nearby shops and restaurants, location is great. Staff were helpful and friendly.  Their pool was just the right size with  serene surroundings.  The room was big and clean and beautiful. I love the quaint touches of the hotel as well."
"This is a great budget resort if you want to stay in Nusa Dua. It is not beach front, but in a good location, a lot of little local eateries, shops around, and the beach isn't that far. They have a beach club which is in the great location of Nusa Dua beach. 
Staff was great, 15 min massage was awesome bonus, swimming pool was cozy and nice, it wasn't crowded, whole feel was relaxing. The room was really big as well as the bathroom. Having a big tub was definitely a plus. 
The closet smelled moldy, so we didn't open it. The bed was really disappointing, not comfortable at all. It wasn't just firm, just bad quality. 
Other than that, it was the best value place in Nusa Dua!"
"We we're very grateful and surprised when they upgraded us to a Villa. Good service and friendly staff. The breakfast buffet was good. Thank you very much Grand Bali Nusa Dua Resort, will be back again for sure."
"I travel with my wife and three young children.  We stay for 5 nights. The room was big, spacious and clean. It can fit 2 single bed, 1 large extra bed, 1 baby cot and my kids still have space to play and move around. The hotel facilities are very well maintained. The pools is nice and the beach is  great, white sandy Nusa Dua beach, perfect weather.  The staffs are very friendly and helpfull.  The location is quite strategic, small shops are easily found around the premises. The best of all was the room rate, we're lucky to get a cheap rate when we booked through online bookings. You can't get rates like that in other hotel in Nusa Dua ITDC. Definitely value for money."
"The Grand Bali is a quiet and relaxing hotel, just on the edge of Nusa Dua. Staff are friendly and always willing to assist, with any requests. The hotel's private beach is only a short ride away in the shuttle bus and is clean and well serviced. The hotel pool and gardens are fantastic."
"Pool was awesome. Room was huge and clean, but it feels old. Best thing is the bathroom. We love it so much, it's big and spacey, clean, water was strong and clear and the soap smells nice. We went for dinner, and when we got back, we found out that all the curtains were closed so that's kinda unpleasant knowing a hotel staff entered you room without permission. Breakfast food selection was good, but the taste are so-so. The internet is really bad, like super slow and difficult to connect. The hotel provided free shuttle to their private beach, but I wouldn't recommend it since the shuttle only runs once every hour. It's better if you rent their bicycle. The private beach is kinda dirty, and in the afternoon you can't really swim at the beach because the water receded so much you can only see coral. It's better if you spend your time at Mengiat beach. Also, it's worth to visit the Nusa Dua water blow when you are on the hotel private beach."
"Great stay. The pools at the Grand Bali are worth all the money. We loved it even in the evenings, when dark, as the water was really nice and warm. Perfect after a long day walking or at the beach! 
The rooms are large!! The bed was ok, perhaps a bit hard for our taste. The bathroom is very Balinese; nice decor touches!
Their beach club is rather poor. We had a couple of drinks there, but went to the Hyatt area to swimm. The beach by the Grand Bali club was dirty, full of plastic debri, and the water was full of stinky seweed. Walking 5min away, awesome clear clean water!
Overall we had a fantastic stay. We used the facilities, had almost all our meals there, and hired their transport and day tour services (unbeatable prices!!). 
I recommend this hotel!"
"We are quiet folks and when we booked online we had no idea where in the hotel our room would be. When we arrived and checked in we were escorted to our room and on the way I remembered saying to my self ""where is he taking me?"" It seemed like we were being stuck in the back out of site somewhere. Well that didn't last long. Once we seen the room and how big it was and the clean and shinny floor, it was a big relief. As it turned out we were at ground level (room 128) and had our own private balcony that no one could see unless they were going in or out of the spa area. Quiet it was, no pool sounds, no annoying roosters or neighbours or traffic! We made good use of the fridge and enjoyed lots of our own in room coffee. Outside the property was the green forest that gave us great shade. We stayed in 3 other establishments while in Bali and The Grand Bali was by far the best!"
"Very warm, friendly and efficient reception staff create a great first impression. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Breakfast offers a good variety of hot and cold food. Free shuttle hourly on the hour to their own part of Nusa Dua beach. Beach towels provided both there and in complex. All in all a high standard of accommodation  for a very reasonable price."
"We considered this place an oasis for us and loved spending time here. At night, the area near the pool is beautifully lighted up and is perfect for sitting out. We had a pool access room which is definitely worth the splurge. The only problem was the wooden ladder from the room into the pool had algae and was slippery. We avoided using it and took 5 more steps to go to the pool from the other side. The hotel was not very crowded and we did not mind this inconvenience. The room itself is HUGE. At night, they had live music. The staff are the real gems of this hotel though. They were always smiling, very courteous and incredibly helpful. What we won't recommend is their ""private beach."" Its a single beach shared by many properties from Grand Bali to Hyatt. Each hotel owns a small section where they put out lounge chairs. But the water has a LOT of seaweed- and as soon as we got in the water, we wanted to get out. This is no-fault of the hotel, so we'll recommend staying here!"
"Undoubtedly the best value for for your money in Nusa Dua for its price range. Close to shops and restaurants, they had their own private beach (unfortunately we didn't get to see it because the last shuttle returns to the resort at 5:30), and facilities and service were very good. On the downside, the food served at the breakfast buffet needs a lot of improvement. Even the local food was unseasoned, and the pancakes tasted strange (good thing there are a lot of nearby restaurants). This hotel seems to be popular with mainland Chinese tourists."
"Spent four nits in this hotel on my first trip to Bali. The hotel has a nice, tranquil feel about it that we noticed as soon as we entered the hotel lobby.... The hotel grounds and pool are lovely and a great place to spend the afternoon following a morning on the hotel's private beach. Food was pretty basic, so we ate most evenings at many of the very good restaurants in Nusa Dua. Would stay there again if we ever come back to Bali."
Booked the garden view room for 5 days. Spacious room and bathroom had comes wz balcony. Free shuttle to Grand Bali beach club. Leaves from 8am every hour thereafter. Nice pool. Buffet breakfast can do better though. For SGD$17.50 it’s not worth it. Had local alacarte breakfast thereafter. Much better. No elevators so those that need special needs may hv to inform the hotel beforehand. Montins ribs are nearby n walking distance to Bali collection. So far good experience overall:))
"Traditional style hotel in Nusa Dua. Everything was amazing, food, drinks, room, facilities and pool area. A short walk to some Wonderful restaurants made for every budget. We enjoyed our stay and would love to come back on our next visit."
2nd and 3rd floor is huge room
"The Hotel is very good , we stayed for 5 nights . Nothing to complain about."
"We traveled with our little baby 5 months old and I was concert for our first visit in Bali. However everything was perfect from the hotel. They helped me with everything I need. Cleaning, accommodation, pool - everything was perfect for me. Private beach is also very good and shuttle can drive you wherever you want to go!
Also it is not very busy at the hotel and this was very good for us.
I will definitely come back again.
Thank you Grand Bali
Tedy Marinova - Bulgaria"
Pleasant stay and very friendly staffs.
The Room in second and third floor is super huge with big bath room. Nice place to stay…
room was very untidy with lots of concern and no one to attend the room.
"We only booked for bed only as wanted to have flexibility in term of food choices - yet we wanted to make sure only for getting the halal food. 
Room is spacious. Yet, the hotel needs a bit of maintenance and if possible of having lift/installed to facilitate the elderly."
"Super green, garden pool, spacious room and love the bathroom space…nice to relax and lay on the pool side."
"Very comfortable bed, nice balcony with garden view"
"Highly recommend! Wonderful staff, beautiful hotel, great food."
"We really loved our room, spacious, beautiful, spotless clean although the towels didn’t smell good, like they were soggy for too long or not properly dried.
The staff was always kind and ready to be at service.  However the hotel infrastructure has been long decayed, it’s outdated and just sad. Spa section seems dead:( no activity for kids at all. The hotel breakfast was okayish, cheap drink selection, horrible bread.
The hotel private beach is small and basic, poor selection of snacks and again general feeling of decadence. 
I’d say if you are keen on spending vacation exclusively in Nusa Dua it’s worth staying at a front beach line hotel with modern facilities and active life, indeed it’s 2-3 times more expensive but you’ll get totally different experience, wonderful one!"
"Great stay without breaking the bank. Yes, you have to get a “shuttle” into the beach rather than walk out the front door, but it runs enough times a day not to worry. Or just pay a couple dollars for a taxi. Great location and staff were so friendly and helpful."
"We stayed 3 nights along with my parents , staff was good and friendly. It's an old hotel, still maintained .
Food not so great."
"Ita a beautiful hotel.
Very close to Nusa beach.
Food and seevice is excellent"
"This is a great hotel. The staff are friendly, the room was large, spacious and the interiors were done really aesthetically. This is definitely a property you can consider of you're staying at Nusa Dua. The only shortcoming is that the beach is around 5-mins drive away. However, they have shuttle services 4-5 times a day which you can avail to go and return from the beach for free, else you can hire a BlueBird for 35.000 Rp. But on the flipside, the beach is pvt., accessible only to the guests of the hotel, and has beach beds, towels and a restro-bar."
"1. Staff is very kind and I got a free upgrade to a suite, which has a individual swimming pool and a independent yard. 
2, 4 star hotel standard with flawless cleaning.
3, private beach club belongs to the hotel  
4, you need to take a shuttle bus to the beach. The shuttle bus departs at 10.00, 12.00, 14.00, 16.00 and back at 10.15, 12.15, 14.15, 16.15, 18.00. 
5, the first night when I waited for the shuttle bus at 18.00 and I waited around 30 minutes. This needs to be improved."
We had a very peaceful and relaxing stay. The staff were very accommodating and nice
One of best resorts to stay in nusa dua area.
"Beautiful everything.  Clean rooms, cold AC, beautiful balinese architecture,  amazing pools, lush gardens, onsite spa and gym, the most wonderful staff. I extended my stay 3 times. Great location. Walkable to anything you could want or need: great massage, resturant choices and grocery store. They have a shuttle to a private spot on the beach with lounge chairs and shade for hotel guests ... an employee is always there do your belongings are looked after while you swim. As a solo traveler it was perfect but it would also be great for couples and families. 100% recommend"
"Excellent allround resort, amazing value for money"
"The hotel is located at the heart of Nusa Dua. Hotel staff are very warm, helpful and accommodating. Also, we were given a free upgrade as a complimentary gift honeymooner's present from the hotel. Will definitely book The Grand Bali again."
Excellent
"First holiday for my wife and I in Bali and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Bali Nusa Dua. 
All staff were smiling and friendly towards us and especially Marsha who went out of her way to ensure our stay was beyond what we expected. Keep up the good work and would happily recommend this hotel to others."
Best thing is the bus shuttle service to the private beach area. Great beach and location
"The Staff was the best part at this resort! So friendly and helpful! The food was good, pool area nice and clean, you get beach towels. Lovely and spaceous rooms and good value for what you pay! Also private beach with transfer, and the ""Main street"" is just a two minute walk! We only spent two nights, but are most likely to return!!"
"Large spacious rooms, very clean, staff extremely helpful."
The staff were very helpful and accomodating. they attended to our needs and query with smile always on their faces. The room were so big and clean. Would definitely stay again if will be back in Bali
The staff were so friendly and amazing with the kids and us.  The room/Villa was awesome.  We had a private pool as well as the main ones.  We loved it and can't wait to go back again.
"Sleepy hotel (bar, restaurant), nice beach area (a drive to get to), however, look for a beach resort on the beach."
ok
Room not ready at 16.00. Ground floor room had poor accessories. At 22.00 i requested engineer to fix AC which took until 22.30. At 23.00 i lost wifi at 1mb and was offered other room. Better accessories etc.
"This is a great place for anyone who is looking to just rest and unwind.  All their staff were very friendly and helpful. Different breakfast spread everyday so it’s very ideal for long-stay accommodation.
Their rooms are spacious and clean. On our first day, the toilet water pipe burst (seems due to normal wear and tear) so they moved us to an upgraded (Premiere Suite) room - at no cost to us of course. =) No lifts/elevator so this might not be ideal for some. But if you’re okay to climb 3 flights of stairs up and down, then you should be good.
Overall, I wouldn’t mind going back to this hotel and would recommend it to family and friends."
"On our second night, October 24, 2019 when we were about to sleep, there are still live bands and singers singing in the pool. And this created so much noise that we could not sleep. We even complained at the front desk but no action taken. We just have to wait for the party to end until almost 10pm. Never again to go to this hotel."
"First impression of the hotel was good. The reception were helpful and fast during check in and check out. The room was clean and spacious, the bathroom could've been more clean in my opinion. Breakfast was good, not really a lot of option, but it was more than enough for us. They will make you fresh scrambled eggs at the counter at your request. Furthermore, the swimming pools were nice. Overall, the hotel seems really quiet as if there are not much guests. We love the free shuttle to the private beach also. The beach was a little dirty at the time, i think it depends on the season. I'm glad we came during low season though. We would love to come back here!"
The resort is very neat and a good place to stay. The staffs were very friendly.
"Old hotel, clean and sound enough but has definitely seen better days. Also well out of the regular Nusa Dua area. The area it’s in it lots of old massage and market shops. Rooms are clean, beds really comfortable and black out curtains but I didn’t think this was value for money at all. Also not near any private beach. It’s a shuttle that leaves on the hour, takes about 10 mins to get to. The beach itself is lovely once there, shack with food and drink also really good. Just not at the hotel."
Good location in Nusa Dua and represents value for money
We were luckily upgraded into a 2-bedroom pool villa. Rooms are so big and with two separate toilets. A sofa in the middle of the rooms and a pool with cabana outside of the room. Really had a great stay! So worth the money!
My kids loved the pool area and pool table but be very careful as if the pool ball leaves the table there is a big drop straight onto cars ( so there is the potential to smash the car windscreen which was a bit if a worry ( really needs to have a hard roof fitted )
"Great spacious room, very clean... amazing balcony... good staff... very good location, just 10 minutes walk to the beach... we will for sure come again :)"
"We stayed on one of their private villas and could stay there forever. It's MASSIVE  with a lot of storage/moving around space. The private pool and outdoor area is to die for! Buffet breakfast was amazing. Ordered lots of room service with ""Bali prices"".  Excellent service from every staff!  Stayed at the end of August and the pool temperature is perfect! There is a free shuttle to their private beach that will also drop off at the Bali collection mall if you want to do some shopping. There is not much to do around the area but we just wanted to chill for 3 nights so this was perfect for us. Highly recommend this hotel!"
"The Room was spacious and the bed was an extra large King Bed which was very comfortable.  The staff were always very polite and helpful. The restaurant area was very clean, only negative was the Bay Marie's only had half the heating on hence the breakfast food was only warm not hot. Pool area was excellent with sufficient seating and shade. Gave it only a 4 for facilities as the Gym was a let down. One of the 2 treadmills worked, the cross Trainer did work only just and needed repair. The exercise ball needed inflating and the free weights too few and too light.  Without the Gym I give it a big 5 out of 5 and will stay again.  Located in a reasonable quiet street and walking distance to shops, restaurants etc. 7 min shuttle to it's private beach.  Nothing is ever perfect but this hotel for the price is pretty good."
Great end to our holiday with friendly staff and a free room upgrade. Terima Kasih.
A really lovely hotel. The rooms were spacious and high quality. Staff could not do enough for you. Breakfasts were buffet style with plenty of choice. The shuttle to the beach club and Kuta were very useful and regular. Pool area was immaculately kept. The beach club was great too with little shops and Warungs nearby. I loved my stay at The Grand Bali.
The bedroom is large and spacious with a decent sized bathroom. All very clean with a good mattress to sleep on and plenty of toiletries to use.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and had a variety of dishes to suit all tastes. You can walk to the local shops or take the free shuttle down to the beach
"Food is expensive but the variety is low to nothing. I had to mix my own drink from the bar just so I can get the right drink (margarita). The staff aren't very friendly and they act as if they are brand new. The beach club is not even close to a beach club, it's a hut with a fridge. The TV in the room had to be replaced by the staff. Housekeeping had to come in during dinner to spray bug spray in the unit because has mosquitoes. I wouldn't recommend this resort."
Nice hotel but a bit outdated. Overall still good and staffs are so nice.
"Beautiful staff very friendly, nothing too much trouble"
"A late find for a day of waiting for our late night Sydney flight after a week’s stay at a much bigger and much more expensive resort nearby. 
We know now where we will be staying next time we are back. This is a great find. Spacious, clean, quaint and the staff welcoming"
"Staff very friendly and accommodating.
Loved the complementary room for a few hours in the arvo. Our flight was not till 10:30pm. We were able to browse around the shops and beach for the day and then return to the hotel in the arvo where a room was provided to shower and freshen up before our departure to the airport ready for the journey ahead. Nice send off touch."
We had a very pleasant stay in grand Bali. Staff was nice and polite and our room was huge. Breakfast buffet was nice with loads of variety and an eggs and pancake station. They also had a shuttle to their beach club with a very good schedule. Recommend it!
"We informed the staff about it, they tried to clean it and sprayed tons of air fresheners but after a while the smell comes back.they promised to move us to a different room but nobody really came to us to initiate.my daughter also saw a rat in our room."
"Loved this Hotel- has a serene beauty - very reasonably priced and tasty meals-rooms grand old style which I love-staff wonderful.
The Beach that the Hotel has its own private section of is just beautiful. Very good food available at the beach. Go to the beach early in the day and stay!
Hotel was fully occupied so need to book."
"The room is nice, spacious and clean.  My son loved the pool access room. The shower was not working well in the room when we checked in on the 1st day. Upon our request, the hotel staff changed our room on 2nd day. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast did not have much variety but was ok. There are 2 small restaurants next to the hotel where the food was affordable and tasty. There is a Bihari Spa opposite the hotel which is very good and the spa packages are value for money. Overall, it is good."
"Nice, clean, tranquil, well maintained old hotel with spacious rooms.
The location outside the BTDC  Nusa Dua, except the private beach."
The location is not the best. But they have free shuttle bus to the “festival lights”. All staffs are very professional. Hotel is old but everything is clean and fully functioned. I would recommend and stay here again.
Staff were friendly. Good to have a smaller spread for breakfast in order to prevent food wastage. Hotel is not by the beach but has an hourly shuttle to ferry to beach.
The rooms were HUGE and clean with friendly staff. The breakfast was simple the omelettes were yummy. The furniture is a bit tired but we would definitely look forward to staying here again.
"Beautiful place to stay, and the private beach club was fantastic!
Extremely helpful and smiley staff.
Gorgeous buffet breakfast, a little pricey but excellent value and there was almost endless choices.
Awesome pools and atmosphere. 
Would definitely stay again no question!"
Nice stay
"Clean nice big rooms ok pools bit of a walk to restaurant, food ok at hotel staff not overly friendly"
"We booked a room with direct access to the pool which is beneficial for my mother who had difficulties to take stairs. She loved it as she could swim anytime she wanted. The swimming pool is quiet, pretty and well maintained. Breakfast was just fine. The room needs a bit of improvement in terms of changing the old sheets and amnesties could be better. The staff is top notch. Location is just perfect."
"Very relaxing ambiance, rooms are clean and homey, free breakfast is good, location is far from the market or shops but if you booked a private car this is not a problem at all. Will definitely book to this hotel again but next time I will book their private Villa :)"
"Great value for money, excellent service, food really nice and very reasonably priced.  Clean and spacious rooms.  Lovely pool area.  Really enjoyed our few days there."
"Was mostly great. Only 3 problem issues; mildewy shower. Tub and toilet were ok, could have been a bit cleaner. Indonesian hygiene is more relaxed than the US. 2nd issue, is it was very difficult to charge our phones. One loose plug had to be propped up with the room menu book. Third issue is the TV reception was terrible and there were limited channels. Otherwise, beautiful pool, amazing and affordable spa, really good food. Fabulous beach with free shuttle. Cute town with good shopping for presents. We loved it all. 😃"
"Staff very friendly and helpful, Old hotel but everything is okay, Kids love the swimming pool!"
"Great hotel! It's not new, but well maintenanced. Rooms are huge! We got free room upgrade which was very appreciated.
If you have late flight you could use hospitality room which is basically the same as regular rooms including shower and everything else, so basically you get free extension of stay from hotel until the evening which is great! I have never seen something like that nowhere else.
Staff is extremely friendly! Patio inside and swimming pool is amazing!"
"Pros: Large beautifully designed spotlessly clean rooms, free beach shuttle and 1 time day Kuta Shuttle 
cons: breakfast and restaurant needs more creative chef very bland food ."
We liked everything. Especially the private beach! We were here 2 times in January.
"pro:
Spacious room,  comfy bed, beach club, friendly staff, price is ok for nusa Dua.
Cons:
Not so clean towel , food in restaurant is acceptable ,not great."
We had a good time staying here. Thank you The Grand Bali!
I had a two night stay in this hotel which is well located and the staff and management were very attentive to my needs.   I brought an issue/concern with one of the rooms to the attention of the staff who immediately got his manager involved and my issue was resolved completely.   The manager granted us an upgrade to resolve our issue.  Which is something that we greatly appreciated making our stay more enjoyable.  I wanted to bring this to your attention so that others guests can be assured than when there is an issue at The Grand Bali the staff and management provide excellent customer service.
Lovely quiet hotel. Cleanliness is impeccable. Staff lovely and helpful. Would have liked a wider menu choice especially more western choices at breakfast
