"We loved our stay at Golden Tulip Jineng resort. We just returned home from our bali trip and want to highly recommend this hotel. Most important thing is the location. You can go to anywhere from this hotel as it is at the convenient location. Staff were amazing and very respectful to all guests. Everytime you pass by a staff member, they stop and say hello or namaste to you with beautiful smile. They upgraded our room to suit which was very kind of them. I still remember how the staff working there (room service, kitchen, restaurant, reception, pool, bar, cafe etc) are so nice and I will miss their smile as it is very hard to find in Australia. They were always ready to help whenever we needed anything. Hotel was nice and very clean. Pool was amazing and in the centre of the hotel so easy to access and safe. You can get a taxi to go anywhere in just 2 min. You can walk to Kuta beach if you like to walk bit. I am looking forward to stay at this beautiful resort and in bali very soon in near future. Thank you"
"I couldnt fault anything on this hotel, we are regular in bali and stays on different villas and hotel. 
Kudos with the chef for the excellent bfast buffet and ala carte menu.
Staff from housekeeping and reception and security are extremely friendly..
We swear to come back here again!! 
15min froms the airport
Allowed to late checkin and checkout for minimal price. 
Love golden tulip!!"
"The staffs were awsome. They gave me an upgrade room from deluxe to suite because of the air conditioner didnt work in my room. The hospitality really good. Food was awesome. The hotel very strategic, big, clean, open air, big pool and big bedroom. So comfort staying here for 4 days. Will be back again"
"We got free upgrade, place was amazing. Middle of the town
But if we would have taken in semiyank for people in 30’s would have been awsome
On top of it the hotel was awesome and really like the place. Value for money"
"It is real 4 star hotel with high quality. Their facilities are great! The room is so clean and spacious. The staffs are very kind. Next trip in Bali, count this place to become your place to stay. Worth the money!"
"Just located at heart of sunset road.
Best location for transit before youre going to ubud, canggu,vv"
"The location is very good, staff very friendly n helpful. Room quite clean. Wifi strong"

"the room was good, quite, the food was delicious, definitely will go back to this hotel again"
"Surprisely we've got upgraded to suite pool view room that have spacious room with living room & balcony. The location is very strategic to going everywhere like airport, bali galeria mall, kuta beach, seminyak etc. So love the ambience of this hotel."
"overall, puas sekali! orangtua yang diajak puas, even sampai saudara yang ikutan beberapa saat disini, juga puas! permintaan untuk kamar side by side diakomodir, hiasan in room juga. what a lovely services! great! can't wait to stay here again soon!!"
The location was the main advantage of the hotel as it is close to the centre and on the way to Ubud and Sanur. Enjoyed the stay and it was totally worth it.
"Very nice hotel in Kuta area with good buffet breakfast, a bit far from the beach but we chose this hotel because it is quite  near the airpot."
"This hotel had good location near to Bandara, Kuta and every places because at the main street....the view is beautiful, and the breakfast are various of food and the taste is okay.
Will be back to this hotel next time when we holiday in Bali."
"Affordable, clean and food is good"
"Short business trip to Bali and booking via Agoda. I was amazed by their hospitality. Front desk lady was nice. Bell boy also.
Room was so nice and I sleep really good. I like with their rule by not smoking in the room. I always hate when enter the room and you can smell the tobaccos. Room was big and a lot of space. Bathroom a bit small but enough for me.
Breakfast also have a lot of variety. From Indonesian food until European food.
For people with own transport, you don’t need to be worried for parking space. The security guy also very helpful."
"Staff is helpful
Afordable price 
Awesome breakfast
Definately will come back...
Thank you for upgrading my room"
The hotel was located very close to the Kuta Beach and it is accessible to all locations including Ubud. We had booked a Pool Access room which was very good. The staffs were very friendly. Overall he had a nice stay in Bali!
"We can to cut our holiday short which meant we missed out on staying here. Previous to this though, there customer service was wonderful in helping with my enquires with my daughter's stay. I asked them if I could give my nights stay to my drivers family to use instead since I had to rush back to Australia. They allowed this and my drivers family had a wonderful stay. Thank you."
"We are 13 female travellers who spent 4 nights here. The room is great, breakfast is   great. The staffs are helpful. We prefer to book at the same hotel when we go to Bali next time"
"overall our stay at this hotel was pleasant, the hotel near tourist area and airport, clean, breakfast was okay even though the breakfast food may not vary.  one thing that I was a little bit upset is because I made a request for honeymoon decoration when I booked the hotel but the hotel did not make any reply or confirmation via agoda/email. So I was did not know if the hotel would fulfill our request or not and turn out on our arrival, the hotel only made the decoration with the towel swan only."
"I am lucky enough to be upgraded to suite. Thank you so much for that.
All the staffs are excellent."
"Great room with pool view, friendly staff, very clean, lovely grounds pool was excellent and very pleasant stay overall great location close to everything."
"a very nice hotel near airport, super clean sm cozy thank you"
Spacious room with balcony. Food at hotel is reasonable price. Great hospitality.
"Thanks Golden Tulip for making my stay in Bali really awesome. We enjoyed everything starting from early checkin to checkout. Breakfast, kids play-area, Gym, Swimming pool, Mini football ground, hotel staff, Room decor everything was perfect.
Hardly 15 mins drive from Airport. 
Best experience so far !!"
"Recommended, near the city, good breakfast, warm swimming pool"
"Great hotel with family friendly facilities such as the kids club & kids pool. They also have spa & gym. The use of pool bar has its time..otherwise you have to order drinks/cocktails from the restaurant inside. The buffet breakfast has variety of food served everyday. The resort has nice  and relaxing surroundings but the location is right infront of the main road. If you need to go to the shopping malls (Kuta beach mall, discovery mall) you need to order a taxi which will cost you $2-$3 AUD one way. The hotel also provides free shuttle to Kuta beach but the scheduled times are only 11am and 4pm.  Overall, we had a great 1 week stay in this hotel. The staff are really nice and friendly."
The hotel is beautiful. Despite being fully booked for new year the staff were warm and friendly. The pool is great. Breakfast menu was good too. We had a lot of fun. Will surely come back.
Near airport. Clean and comfy room.
"Stayed here twice throughout our 3 week visit to Bali, 2 nights when we first arrived and one night before we left. Good location, close to shopping mall and airport. Would recommend."
"All staff was nice polite and gentle, especially with my little ones. I super recommend."
"The pool access room was the best! Breakfast were great and nice selection. The pool is nice too. Great services, they upgraded my room. Superb!"
"room was huge, bed was comfy, breakfast was vary and delicious, good hotel for children as well"
Close to everywhere
"Everything worth .
I love the breakfast"
The staff was amazing. They remembered our names and did everything they could to help.
overall super puas stay di hotel ini. kamarnya oke bangettt.. untuk makanannya so so aja tapi ketutup dengan all facilities yang ada.. will be back pastinyah
bestt hotelll
"Breakfast is great catering  for westerners & non-westerners. Lots to choose from.
My room is 71sq metres & very comfortable.
Great disappointment though - dinner - never again. Not much to choose from and i had a macaroni bolognaise. Worst bolognaise meal I have ever had in my life. So disappointed - they should remove this dish from the menu. Needless to say i will not have dinner here again."
"Eventhough the location is not near beach, but the room, facilities and breakfast are excellent. This is my 2nd stay and always satisfy."
"We're here in Pandemic situations, so everything is so limited include the breakfast and food in restaurant. But overall stay was great."
The view from my bedroom was best
Hotel bagus.. Harga bagus... Lokasi baguss... Staff ramah
"it’s calming and relaxing view of the hotel ground with the big pool
nice room good job"
"Kamarnya luas, kolam renangnya juga besar, fasilitasnya oke, bersih. senang bisa nginep disini, next mau kesini lagi deh buat quality time bareng keluarga"
"Best room , best serving , best BF , Kind Staff"
Best hotel and all the staff very helpful and friendly
Good choice
Nice place and clean.
"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel..the hotel condition was good…We recommend you to take garden view (they said garden view is only for smoking room) because you will get balcony which..Our room was smaller than what stated(it stated 35 m2 but it was only 28 m2 at max) but the staff said it was because we choose non-smoking room..so 35 m2 is include balcony..the toilet is small but i saw other room (family type) and it was nice so I recommend this hotel for family who choose family room type..the ambience is nice and not spooky..a lot of children and this hotel has a lot of area where you can hang out with your family such as gazebo, swimming pool, tennis table, mini soccer field for kids…the breakfast food was okay..oh 1 more thing..when we came to our room the sheet has big stain and we ask the staff to check it..after a while they change it to the new one..maybe because it’s full booked thats why they were overwhelmed and didn’t check the sheet properly..Overall it’s a nice value for money hotel especially if you bring your family"
Kamar yg luas
"location ok , hotel clean and recipation ok"
All the amenities / facilities one is looking for is there.
best luxury hotel in kuta
All are good
All are nice
"We enjoyed the stay in Golden tulip hotel. Highly recommend this for families and family groups. Its at an ideal location which is away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta, but in a walkable distance to all the happening places.
Staff were extremely supportive and addressed all issues on time.
Breakfast was continental and local, and the live counters assisted us with customization. No issues on the quality of food. But still would suggest hotel to keep few Indian dishes on the breakfast buffet menu.
My small feedback on the hotel rooms is to have a better upkeep of washrooms and bedsheets during guest stay as well.
Overall enjoyed the stay, the pool, and other facilities offered by the hotel. Thanks for hosting us."
Nice place to stay!
Awsome always love staying there.
"This was my 3rd times booking at the same hotel. 1st time in Jan. 2020, second time was last June and the last time recently end of August.  I must be very satisfied with the hotel otherwise I would have chosen thousand other hotels at the beautiful Island.   There are some plus and minus but the pluses outweigh more than the minuses.  I will definitely book a room at this hotel again in future."
"The word resort in the title sounded like a bit of a joke, but it really does feel like a mini little resort. Really nice place and great value for the money."
Overall stay was good. Breakfast options could have been better though but overall it was good
Pinjam alat makan ada charge 15rb
Hotel in the middle of the city... Easy to go everywhere.
We loved the place. Staff are friendly. They gave us a free room upgrade for our honeymoon which we really enjoyed.
Everything just good
"Best location and the staff is really helpful. For deluxe city view room is not clean, smelly and many mozzies. The suite room is the best !!!"
"Golden tulip is a very friendly well kept hotel. Great access to the beach and some shops. The only down side is that the main resterant and bar are is a bit away, but gojek taxi are very cheap and take u there for about 30,000"
"hotel's location very strategic, close to many holiday destinations"
"Luxury but many of facility of hotel not function,  may be cause pandemic covid 19.   We hope pandemic go out so we can stay again...  GBU"
"Nice breakfast , staff friendly and pool is nice , WiFi not too strong but Oke, central location"
We used Grab drivers to get around. Would  definitely stay again.
"The room that I book facing the pool is great, too big for me alone as a solo traveller. The facilities, like the gym, and swimming pool is awesome. The breakfast is nice, offering the variety of food everyday I was there. However, the in call food from the hotel is not so great. But overall, its a good hotel and I wouldn't mind come and stay again."
"Beautiful lobby, free upgrade to a pool front view, lovely staff, easy to get to around, lots of shops in convient  location"
"They should improve the air conditioning system.....at setting 18c it felt like 26....it seems many rooms had same problem.....otherwise breakfast, ambience and staff were first class....keep up the good work!!"
arrived very late from airport…and left early morning for Gili islands…ideal transit hotel……magnificent buffet breakfast
The staffs very friendly and helpful
"Well appointed hotel, great facilities but a little far from Kuta, etc. transport would be needed. Close to airport."
"Love the pool access room, my kid can go to swim whenever she wants."
"Stayed for honeymoon. Overall, room is clean and beautiful set up, balcony is a bit dirty (you might want to wear provided slippers), staffs are friendly and helpful, breakfast food is awesome and lots of choices, location is nice (city center)."
"The hotel was good. The facilities clean and looked after. A bit of a long walk around building if placed in centre of hotel like we were. Breakfast was nice. I was disappointed that on the map it looks like there are two shopping centres close enough to walk, but one is almost empty and you cannot reach the other without doing a humungous loop and would need a car in reality. Other than that, it is a good hotel."
Nice hotel 👍
"Kamarnya nyaman, view tempatnya oke bisa buat refreshing banget. Krn disini rata2 kamar lewatin jalan outdoor jd kalau hujan agak ribet aja, tp so far aman dipinjemin payung."
Hotel family friendly yg dket kemana2 cari makan gampang. Kamar bersih cuma harusnya book pool view tp viewnya ketutup pohon but its okay. Breakfastnya lumayan dan bervariasi. Ada kebocoran air di lemari baju tp cepat tanggap diatasi meski cuma dikasih compliment laundry dan buah tp so far cpt bgt diatasinya gk nunggu nanti. Semoga bisa lebih baik lg kdpnnya. I'll be back soon klo ke bali. Thank you gtjineng
"Location wise very strategic especially when you need to catch a flight early in the morning this would be the right hotel for you. Unfortunately the building condition quite disappointing (considering the pandemic might put them in struggle to maintain all the physical asset), my first room was not impressive, moved to the second one with better room condition, overall stat was amazing, great staff."
"nice clean place, great for couple. but the lightning is little too dark for family with little children"
very pleasant hotel but upkeep is a bit disappointing for such an unmarket hotel. breakfast is ibncredible with huge range from local to western.
"I was there during 2nd and 3rd week of March. Rooms are not fully soundproof. Food was good and as number of guest reduced they stopped providing Buffet breakfast. Overall hospitality is great, Food is also good, Swimming pool wasn’t that neat and clean. Anyway, still I’ll recommend this hotel and hope hotel authority will take my inputs positively and work on Improvement areas."
Makanannya Good
I assume Because of cheap rate They only Clean room every 2 days and block international TV so we are stuck in room with only nominal local Channels not good enough for 4 star hotel we feel like second class citizens we could have stayed in homestay with better service
"I would recommend this place to my friends.  There are ranges of rooms from normal room to suite.  The facilities are sufficiently available and the breakfast is good.
There are many nearby places to go for your vacations activities."
Worth the price
"The room was very spacious, the price is affordable. This is the second time I get here. Great location because it’s  in the main road."
"For city hotel all you need is complate in this hotel, there's kidclub,gym,kids swiming pool, our kids really enjoy the time there. Need some inprovement about cleanliness in room, pool and garden. Room bit small and not soundproof. Breakfast not so many options. You also still can hear noise from road its realy distrubed.  Anyway thank you for room birthday decoration and comp cake."
"Hotel front desk staff are very pleasant and helpful. Good facilities and decent breakfast. Affordable resort.
Toilets are not very clean. Staff were hesitant to clean the toilet when we requested."
"Must clean ur side pool, its very dirty.
More variaty for breakfast menu. Everyday is the same menu."
"Personally this is my favorite hotel. I always choose to stayed here, everytime I went to Bali. Before the pandemic, everything about this hotel was really nice.
But, my last stay (on Aug 2022) it felt like an abandone hotel :( I feel sad. I have so much old good memories about this hotel. I think the management really needs to consider about the renovation to save the hotel."

"This resort has great hospitality, service standard, honest and friendly staff! Thank you for taking care of me."
Very nice hotel
"Nice hotel but needs renovation its very tired, rooms were spacious and comfortable, only moan was that the pool was dirty water was merky so couldn't go swimming which was a dissapointment"
"Great location and value for money. Breakfast is good with wide option from asia to western menu.
Location is at the main road, so this hotel is near many tourist locatiob like kuta and nusa dua.
During my stay, i had dirty water (black sand) in my room. Although the mechanic said had flush the pipe, the dirty water still happened. Its frustating since i’m with infant and had to use clean water to shower the baby.
Further, on the last 2 days of my stay, the AC became hot. Since the AC was controlled by the central system, we cant do anything to it.
They only operated 1 lift, and it unconvenient if there is many guest who want to use the lift."
All iz good. See u in another time golden tulip🙌
The room so comfortable. The staff friendly. The pool little bit dirty.
"Nice spacious room, clean, polite staff, Didn't try the food.
a suitable relaxing massage next to the hotel"
"Rooms need some upgrading. Very outdated . Breakfast buffet was amazing though & staffs were courteous & friendly . Would have been a 5 star all the way if it weren’t for small, old room."
I appreciated the hotel gestured allowing me to change the date of my booking (due to medical reasons) although my booking from Agoda didn't allow for amendment.
"Shower floor is flooding while you are showering... I have to wait until water is drain after husband took shower.... apparently they are not giving us new slippers. There was ants on the table~ 
Hotel, please clean it properly before you take another customer check in"
"great clean cheap stay for no frills, everything is good, bed is comfy and smells good."
"Great facilities, friendly staff. Small problem at check in and received 30 minute massage and fruit bowl for free."
