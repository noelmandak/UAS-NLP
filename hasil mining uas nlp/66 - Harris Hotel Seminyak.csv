Column 1
"Sure, more expensive than homestays, but less expensive than 5 star hotels.
Yet, here you get basically everything you need with CNN, BBC, other world channel, great service and in house laundry. 
It feels almost like a hotel in Europe. 
No complaint of the service ever.
The staff is great, it's close to the beach and the bed is fantastic which are the Golden 3 that makes me want to come back here, over and over. 
Across the street a 24 hour open shop. You get to most of the great places for under 18000 IDR on a Gojek motorbike taxi.
3 minutes to the best part of the beach and did I mention this place has great beds and pillows? 😁
Oh, and the Irish bar down the street is a friendly place to meet people plus they show the football matches. 
😉"
"I went with my bestfriend to bali and we stayed at Harris for the entirety of our trip which was 5 days 4 nights. It was a very nice and convenient hotel which is worth more than the price we paid. The staff was extremely friendly and when I requested for iron and iron board, they gave it to me right away and didn’t take it away when they came for housekeeping which is great. Sometimes other hotels have a limited number of iron and ironing board so I’m sure Harris has a lot in stock which is great! Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, yet convenient and comfortable place to stay in Seminyak."
"We've been here thrice. Booked the room with direct pool access. Kids enjoyed the stay here. Staffs especially, Ayu, Arif, Aris made our stay very welcoming each time. The security guards, they made us feel safe whenever we crossover to the mart opposite, they assisted us with crossing over by manning the busy traffic. There's 3 24/7 convenient store opposite the hotel. The location is 10 minutes walk to the beach and 5 minutes walk to Nalu Bowls."
Very friendly staff making you feel very welcome which makes your stay that much better. They are very keen to help you with information and help in any other way. Also the complimentary breakfast has a really wide variety that doesn't let you feel like leaving the breakfast table. I started with a group of 7 and everyone enjoyed it a lot.
Absolutely loved it here at Harris. The staff are amazing. So friendly. I like the location as I'm very familiar with this area. My recommendation is to ask for a room away from the roadside as it's noisy at night with motorbikes but on the other side I never heard a thing. Rooms are basic but very clean with a very comfortable bed. Can't wait to return
"Highly recommended this hotel as it’s super close to everything.The beach only minutes away.Mixwell and BaliJoe only roughly 5minutes walk away.Staff members is super friendly and helpful.
The only negative thing is the water pressure of the shower is lower than average,however we still managed to make the best out of it."
"Wonderful experience. I used the swimming pool, I slept well, I was provided with plenty of clean drinking water, free toothbrushes etc.
I highly recommend trying out the SPA experience (H'Spa). I was blown away by the quality of the services."
"I stayed at the Harris Hotel for two nights. Room was very comfortable, clean and bright. Air conditioning was great as was the location. Excellent value for the price. Good location and walking distance to Seminyak. Unlimited water station and I liked the inclusion of magnifying makeup mirror in the bathroom. Staff very prompt and helpful. Would stay here again for a budget hotel."
"Hotel is good close to seminyak square, room is big and clean, aircon is cold. The only downside is the room that we chose which is the harris unique room with balcony was facing the street so early in the morning its quite noisy. But overall harris hotel is a good hotel for those on a budget. Will surely stay here again on our next bali tour and will recommend to my friends."
"Super clean hotel. Looked as good as pictures. Very helpful friendly staff! Laundry service was great! And pools looks amazing. Live band one of the night I was around for dinner time. All in all it was very nice experience.
Near all the gay bars but not in your face."
"Very nice hotel and also Food quality is good. It has two pools and one restaurant and one pizza place. Room sizes are okayish. Only thing that I didn't like was they should provide sealed per water bottle, otherwise very good"
"I stayed here at the end of Dec 22. Location-wise, I find this hotel to be strategically placed; short walk away from the main street in Seminyak and the Seminyak beach, but also in a location that is relatively quiet compared to the main streets.
The staff is very helpful and friendly, and will try to accomodate your request as much as they could.
The facilities are a little outdated, and I had some issues with the safe in my room. All in all though, it was a really good hotel to stay at for the price they offered."
"For the price that they offer, it's a great hotel. The room was clean, not to small and has all the basic amenities you might need. Friendly and helpful staff. They also porive free shuttle to Seminyaj Square and beach. Very nice affordable hotel."
"I found the Harris Hotel to be Clean and friendly and reasonably priced.  
I would definitely recommend the Harris Hotel to anyone looking for a fine Hotel to stay when in Bali."
i would recommend this hotel to everyone. great cleanliness awesome staff awesome food..all facilities.. just wow.please try once on my recommendation
The hotel is centrally located with the best Facilities. The staff are really helpful and almost all the amenities are present. Highly recommended.
"Efficient and good value for money. Room was comfortable, staff pleasant, decent location."
"Very recommended, all the staff are helpful and very welcoming.."
You can walk everywhere. Food is good but service fee is expensive. Nice area and great staff.
"Great Hotel, location and very friendly staff!!"
"For those who says its a hotel lower than 4 star hotel, u get what you pay for."
The Harris Unique room category faces the street therefore loud music from the Irish Pub in front of hotel.  Noise does travel upward.  I have stayed at Other category rooms facing the back which was quieter. This visit I chose the Harris Unique room which was more spacious and it had a nice big private balcony. The internet is quite fast and reliable.  The breakfast spread buffet was good. Lots of choices to eat.  Several convenient stores and restaurants along the street of the hotel in either direction.  The beach is a 10 -15 minute walk unless you want to wait and take the shuttle according to their schedule.
Good services
"Love this hotel for a base. Great value for money, clean and good location. Bed was so comfortable.  It's no Anantara but if you are on a budget and don't mind a short walk to the beach this is a great base."
"Cheaper compared to others in similar standards. It has its own underground parking. Nice and friendly staff. Room was ok, not too small.  Good location, not at a busy street but just a parallel to main street."
"After a 3 year absence due to covid, I returned to Bali and the Harris Hotel, Seminyak. As always, I felt very welcome and looked after. Great value for money and so well located to cafes, restaurants and the beach. I had problems with noisy guests in the room next door, who took no responsibility for nor cared about the effects of their actions on others. The staff handled the situation so professionally. I especially want to thank Udi and Arif on reception."
"We love Harris. This was our second stay here and we'd recommend it to anyone looking for great value and a great location. You can walk to the beach and some great beach bars eg. La Plancha. There are fantastic restaurants right by the hotel, especially Wacko. The pizza restaurant within the hotel is great too, delicious actually. You're also walking distance on a flat road in to the heart of Seminyak. The rooms are super clean, and comfortable. The staff are lovely and helpful too. The hotel itself is quite simple but it's location and value for money make it a great stay. There are a few pools too, they're all small and two of them are by the road, so it's noisy and not at all relaxing, but you're so close to the beach that it doesn't matter. Highly recommended!"
"The room is very clean, the staff also very helpful, location also very good"
The staff at this hotel have to be the most friendliest we have ever experienced and we have stayed in a lot of hotels. The noise from the street and bars can be a problem however the bars have to stop loud music at 11 (try to get a 4th floor room). The breakfast is substantial and a large selection; children eat for free👍. The only thing that lets this hotel down is that the paint work and swimming pools are aging and grubby. Excellent value though.
"Had the pool access room, very close with the walk-in gate across the Bottle Avenue, damn it was so easy to order food online.
Everything were great, really nice stays.
Love the sandals btw. The internet connection turned out fine all the time.
We've asked for 2nd working chair and they provided it.
Good work from hotel experience, combined with perfect Seminyak spot, had no complaint.
However until the last day of our check out, the staff was presented in front of us and in the lobby, but they had no initiative to help us load the luggages to our car. That's the only bad impression so far."
"Great hotel for the price. Clean, Fast internet and good location. I'd like to recommend this accommodation."
great location great service clean however can hear every noise
I’ve stayed here many times and likely will again. The staff are friendly and super helpful.
Breakfast here is unbelievably good and tasty! Best breakfast ever at a hotel!
Very convenient location and helpful staff.
Best place with the best staff!
Great hotel
"The rooms were clean, comfortable, and the staff was amazing. I will recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Seminyak."
"Great location, walking distance to the beach. The room is clean but the water in the bathroom is not strong, I stayed at top floor."
Everything is good
"What more do you need in your hotel when on holidays? Great location. Air con cranks. Bed is super comfy - pillows nearly got taken with me! I promise I left them behind. It may not be 5 stars, but you yet what you pay for and in this case you get a great return on investment."
"I had a packed schedule with tours everyday so was only using the hotel to literally sleep. It was ideal in terms of location and cost. If you want to spend longer resting hours inside the hotel, better to go elsewhere... perhaps a hotel with jacuzzi or inside pool may be ideal. There were a couple of rainy days that poured out for a few hours, and I was bored inside as swimming pool was outdoors. 
The furniture and bathroom seems a bit old as well but I can’t complain for the price of the room. 
I could hear people walking outside when trying to sleep and also next room.. walls aren’t sound proof. 
Leakages in hallways when raining heavy. 
The shuttle to the shops and beaches was great though. 
Horrissimo pizza, was not that great.. 
slow customer service, and they forgot my prawns on my pizza (only realised when I left because I bought takeaway to eat somewhere else). Pricey for the quality."
staff are friendly and helpful
Great value
"The team are very friendly, and are always helpful. The hotel is very clean especially the rooms. They clean everyday. The location is very good. shops are not far away and at night its a very quiet place so you can rest easy.
I recommend you get the breakfast with your stay. Will be back here next time im in Bali. Thanks everyone at the hotel for my awesome stay."
"Location of property is very good. Just minutes away you can find Cafes, Warungs, Spas, Laundromat, Tattoo shops, Convenience stores, Souvenir shops. Water 🚿 pressure is excellent. Wifi speed needs a major improvement. Beds are comfortable. Breakfast quality and variety can do much better. Overall I’m pleased with my stay. I do recommend this hotel"
"Good hotel in heart of seminyak, but the outside was a busy road, many traffic.
But the room was okay."
Had a great stay at Harris and awesome staff. We stayed in a group of 4 and found it to be a great hotel for the price we paid. A few things were broken in one of the rooms and the breakfast was okay and enough to get you through but there’s plenty of good breakfast places around the place. I’d recommend this place highly to anyone that wants a comfy big room with a good central location. Make sure to say hi to the guys across the road at Volt Burger!
Would love to back if stay in seminyak
if you looking for somewhere quiet. lots of minimarket surround. 10 minutes walk to the beach.
"The hotel is located not far from the beach, staff are friendly and the room is ok for the value."
"Harris hotel Seminyak is usually where I go back to because I like it's location, near to shopping, restaurants, spa's, the beach and a real comfy bed. 
I usually have nothing bad to say. 
It's clean, it has CNN & BBC and I enjoy my stays.
 
This time the price doubled over Christmas and yet the phone wasn't working, aircon flooded the entire floor in my room and no hot water showers for two days although I had a ""unique"" room.
I had to change rooms 3 times for a 4 day stay. 
 Staf was, as usual, very service minded and very friendly apart from one little girl that  said her name was ""Catharina"", who put up an unbelievable attitude that was so out of order I have contacted the management.
When this is the experiance you are left with, one tends to start looking at things I normally wouldn't see. 
The rooms are getting old, stains on toilet seats and floors, doors need paintjobs and windows are dirty. 
This hotel really needs an over all update.
No, this visit was not worth the extra money. Sorry."
Swimming pool special for children and a kids room are good. Worth the stay if you have children
"traveled during Dec 2020, I quite understand the difficulties they’re facing. The limitations of many things. The plus points are of course from the staffs whom were really helpful and nice and they’re following the health protocol. The minus points are the bed is not really comfortable, parquet floor in the bedroom smelled like a sweaty feet even though it has been cleaned. Breakfast was just okay."
Harris needs to look at soundproofing.
"I like this hotel. The best beds (not too soft and not too hard but perfect ) and lots of pillows on a three month journey.
Three pools, but I didn't try since the best beach is close and that's where I spent most of my time. 
The staff is very nice and hardworking. 
Helping out with anything possible and with a smile too. 
Not really a walk to the beach , because of this heat,  but they have a shuttle every hour.
It does not do pickups back to the hotel, but nothing a scooter taxi can't fix fast and cheap.
The warung shop across the street is open really late and there's an Irish pub close by with live music and great singers.
What I miss? 
A hotel bar with a vibe."
Walking distance to most of the places
"One of the preferred hotel in Seminyak, can go to shops & good restaurants by walking, breakfast is quite good"
breakfast a bit weird but overall great
Good and comfortable
"Harris Seminyak my favorite hotel ,"
The toilet was big and the room was spacious. Bed was comfy. There were various food options available just across the road or a walk away.
"Room was ok,  large bed.
But a bit noisy from the street.
Breakfast can be improved.
Overall ok"
"I stayed for 1 weeks in the unique package room everything was good except the Aircon and the Wi-Fi I I could not asleep from the heat 
I ask to change my room they did change on floor 5 but the other room was the same 
When u book unique package room they offer u free dinner but The option is limited you cant choose any type of the food"
"The location of the hotel is pretty good,there is a mini market infront of the hotel.The restaurant in the hotel has a reasonable price plus they serve some pretty good food."
"The hotel was ok, with nice room.
Location near some resto but not walking distance.
The breakfast need to be improved.
I think they understaffed, it took time for check in.
Overall was Ok."
The hotel was a great cheap option for me to spend a couple of days and meet a friend - breakfasts weren't extensive but more than enough - facilities are more than the price indicates -excelllent value for a cheap stop over.
"room clean, staff are kind, location not far from the beach, value for money."
"What I'd like to note is Harris Hotel Seminyak can develop more from these aspects:
1. Parking lot and Valet Parking system: It took quite some time only to get out from the hotel because I need to wait for the staff to take my car. It was peak season and there were lots of guests who wait for their cars altogether to get picked up in the lobby. I think Harris Hotel can develop this parking system to improve guests' comforts
2. Always check on room facilities before guests check in: when I was checking in, I noticed that the water heater was not working and I had to call receptionists and dealt with the technician. It took some time for me in order to be able to rest after checking in. I hope in the future Harris Hotel can always check in room facilities before check in time so guests can rest after checking in"
Location is good and near to the beach
"location of the hotel to the attractions in Seminyak take 10 mins to walk to at most, which is definitely a plus."
Decent for the price.
Tried to check in to one of our 2 rooms early. Room was vacant but they wouldn’t let us in until 2pm unless we paid extra. Why not? It created a bad first impression.
nice breakfast menu and clean room
Booked and used it for the 10 hrs we had between checkout from another hotel and until we left to airport. Staff were lovely.
"because you can here everything from the next room, next level, the street and even the wind"
"Excellent value, good location, very clean also the staff very friendly."
"Worth the price if you mind only for location, and price wise. But if you seek for comfort for sleep after whole day tired travel schedule, you will find it less comfort since u can hear almost everything from ur room. People talking, car passing by etc. But for location, room facility and price quite okay."
Good price for the room and its facilities. Location of the hotel itself is not too bad. It also has a gym although it's small. It's recommended for the price conscious travelers. Just a reminder that Covid-19 test results is required upon check in.
"Clean rooms good bed linen fair size. Shower was very weak. Comfortable to sleep. Definitely better than budget. Would not pay more than another 260,000 IDR"
Value for money 👍
"3 nights in Harris Seminyak, first two days was absolutely amazing but on third day when the staff made up our room, I got bite by Flea/Bedbug, my left and right legs are both super itchy now with total of 10+ bite marks."
"the wing of the hotel that has been opened in corona is directly opposite  bar that blasts music until i dont know what hour as i checked out early, i left at midnight, all rooms face the street"
"The pools get no sun so freezing 
It’s a large hotel with no Ambience"
"The location was great, located at not too noisy street. There are 3 convenience store at the opposite of the hotel so it made us easier if we needed something.
The room was great, the bathroom was ok. The bathroom needs improvement, adding a glass door at shower room would help since the water would not go out of shower room.
Some of the staffs didn't wear mask.
The staffs also didn't replace the body gel with the new one even if the body gel at bathroom is empty, so need to ask front office to deliver the body gel and it happened for 2 days in a row. I think the staffs should replace the body gel everyday, especially if it was empty."
"I know Harris Hotel as a middle-class famous hotel chain and that’s why I chose to stay in this hotel during my stay in Bali. However, my expectations were not met. I receive reports from my mother-in-law who traveled with us that she saw some sand in the coffee/tea box in her room. The housekeeper was also hesitant to clean her room just because she put a Do Not Disturb sign on her room for the whole day during “housekeeping day” (she was sick the whole day hence she didn’t want her room cleaned).
For me, it was more of the ambience. The pizza restaurant looked empty and poorly lit. So did the hallways.
Anyway I hope this will be temporary since I understand that Bali is now struggling to get up after the Covid crisis. I hope everything goes back as normal and Harris Hotel can live up to its’ name again."
Fulfill expectation
"Very basic budget place. Ok for a short stay.
Staff are very nice and friendly.
Not particularly clean however when I asked the staff to clean my room properly they did do it very promptly. 
Pool area isn't very inviting. Interior needs updating."
Was only just reopening during my stay so things had some bugs but it was a fine place to stay before heading to Sumatra
just good not excellent not bad
"Good location, great service, near convenience store and right behind the main street where all the restaurants are located"
"The inside of the hotel and room feels like an older facilities. Some chips on the bathroom door and the overall feel of the room is old and slightly dingy, unlike at Harris in other cities where it's a bit more ""relaxing"". But the staff and location are super great, if you are just staying in the hotel at night to sleep and shower it's good enough."
"Despite staying many enjoyable  times before, and being a Tauzia member, they gave me a bad, tired and noisy room which I had to change after one night.  This has soured me with Harris Hotel. It is a good hotel, but do not accept a noisy tired room on the street side. Insist on a good room on the non street side."
"Nice hotel, in a good location for the price. Fairly clean, could have done with a proper clean in the bathrooms and under the bed though. Lovely staff."
Great location however very noisy. Would be good for young back packers not good for young families
Softest beds and lots of good pillows.
The staffs need to be improved. Need a long time for check in process while the staffs work slowly.
good location
Decent hotel to stay.
"Hotel is quite big and renovated. But it is located on noisy street, has very small territory and almost no sun near the pools. They don't give bottled water and after their water from cooler whole our family had problems with health. They try to clean rooms good, but several times we faced big cockroaches in room, that was terrible!"
Room is a good size but simple. Staff were generally helpful. Road is a bit busy outside but quietens down after 1am.
"Room was clean and spacious but the windows need to be sound proof.  i stayed on the top floor (5 floor) facing the main road and was woken every morning around 6 by the beeping of motor bikes., staff were great and helpful, breakfest had a great variety."
"Like 15 mins walk to the beach. Towel was grey color, room is small. Shower broken not hot we have to call service! Breakfast is not good but have good coffee machine, although coffee machine keep having notifications need to been clean. So not going ti come back. But cheap price!"
"Modem hotel, Doesn't have any  Bali vibes"
Title says it all
"The towels were black and not white.
I made a double booking for the same dates and refuse to refund me back"
"I have a disappointing stay at this hotel. Poor guest relation. The towels were old and grey, toilet counter has mark stains . Room is basic."
"paid already as a gift, but still guest end up paying"
nicely done
The room was moderately clean but a bit over priced.
The linen was not to clean .I will not revisit this hotel again
resort in middle of no where  not even amoneychangerFree shuttle is a con  one way only uneed  taxi togetback Got nothing goin gor it food very poor topdollar
"Very Noisy. Many cars and bikes going by on main street. Irish Pub and clubs and restaurants directly across the street. Staff are opening up the pool and restaurant just below our room at 6:30 am. Talking loudly so difficult to sleep, But should be up anyways so not a major problem."
"Harris hotel disappointed on this occasion. Rooms dirty, selection of food and beverages poor, front desk staff unhelpful. I’ve stayed here many times prior to covid but Harris hotel has lost its attention to customer service and quality."
"They was fully booked out and we had very noisy neighbours had to complain for 2 days as they where playing music and being loud until 5am and the hotel wouldn’t do anything about it or re-room us.
Then tried to be rude and charge me 1million rupia for not clean bedding that they hadn’t even washed.car park was full and left us no where to park also.
So bad experience for us won’t be going back there again"
I left after viewing the rooms small plastic with no sound proofing road noise was very audiable from the back rooms of the hotel as well you could hear peaple talking in the next room!  A cheaply made hotel! I walked out and my money was not refunded!
"When we arrived at the Harris, we were greeted by ""Nico"" who made our check in a breeze. He was very freindly and gave us a fantastic first impression of the hotel. We booked a unique room which was brilliant -  balcony, large comfy bed, great flat screen TV with heaps of channels, lots of space and great bathroom. The wifi at the hotel is fab, you only have to log in once a day. There are 5 swimming pools at this hotel, the flying pool is a little piece of heaven. The hotel is spotless, very clean. No matter what time of the day we left our room, within an hour of returing the room had be cleaned,  fresh towels and complimentary water everyday. The location was great for us, 10 minute stroll to double six beach and all the bars. We took the complimentary buggy ride to the beach where the hotel has private sun beds for guests to use in the best location, they also provide free beach towels too. A ten minute walk in the other direction will take you to the Main Street in Seminyak. The buffet breakfasts in the hotel where a triumph, so much choice and the staff,  every morning so friendly. The pizza restaurant was joy!! Awesome Italian style pizza, beautiful fresh salads, nice wine and great service. On the street where the hotel is located there are also a number of bars and restaurants, an awesome bakery and coffee shop, as well as spa's and a mini mart and circle k right on the doorstep - so convenient. We extended our stay for a further couple of nights, and stayed a week in total and we still don't want to leave. I have to commend the management for hiring such great people, the staff here are all so wonderful, always a smile and a hello and eager to help with anything you need. Having stayed in many hotels in Bali, the Harris is the highlight for us, and we can't wait to come back. Our friend is getting married and we have recommend the Harris to all our friends also coming to bali for the wedding. Thank you for such a wonderful stay 😃"
"I would highly recommend this hotel due to multiple reasons.. please don’t waste time looking for reviews and complaints, coz I did the same and doubted staying in Harris Seminyak .. To be honest , this is a really affordable four star hotel with absolutely great staffs all around ,and clean rooms (maybe not like a five star, but Super clean ).. I was taken around Bali at affordable price by a driver I met through my friend(Mr Lutfi +62 81338303031).. A splendid 4 nights stay in Harris Seminyak .. kudos to you guys .. will be visiting Harris hotel , without wasting any time"
We are staying at Harris Seminyak until we can fly out of Bali. We have been delayed due to the Volcano and Harris Hotel has been a savior since we had to leave our Villa. The rooms are big and comfortable and the interconnecting rooms are perfect for families. The location in Seminyak is great. Easy walk to beach and shopping. There's a shuttle that will take you to Seminyak Square or to the Harris Hotel beach club where you can spend your day on a lounge chair with an umbrella free of charge. The staff here are VERY friendly and helpful and are taking great care of us. We will definitely stay here again.
"If you are looking for somewhere cheap and cheerful in Seminyak, Harris Hotel on Jl Drupadi is the go to place.  
We like to stay here for a few nights when we first arrive from the airport, then decide what part of Bali we'll head off to next (usually the south as it's less crowded).
It's conveniently located close to many restaurants, supermarkets and the beach (although we've never been to Seminyak Beach, we leave that for when we get to the south of Bali as the beaches are pristine).
Close by is Kreol Cafe (fantastic for breakfast/lunch and young fresh coconuts. Or if you prefer, Harris has restaurants/room service on site.
Agung on the Front Desk always goes above and beyond to assist us with whatever we may need."
