"very quite even though it was across from finns 
staff were awesome and friendly rooms were great"
"This place is good for anyone visiting Canggu. Great for couples.. especially if plan to visit Finns, it’s right across the road! We enjoyed our stay, very comfortable and the staff are amazing as always. We will be vack"
Just a wonderful experience. Every single staff member we interacted with was so nice.
"Location is unbeatable for the price, it's near Old Man's, The Lawn, and right next to Tugu Hotel (if you want to take yoga or meditation classes). So many restos, cafes, and shops nearby. Breakfast buffet was just ok, Food at the restaurant at the hotel lobby was great. Staff are very friendly and accomodating. I would stay here again."
"The staff were very nice and i thoroughly enjoyed my stay there! especially the pool overlooking the beach, such a great view"
Situated right in the beach and sitting alongside Finns Beach Club. The place gets busy at night when people head to the clubs but a good place with a ‘private!’ Yard off the beach so you don’t get hasseled by locals selling. The rooms are very spacious. Would definitely stay again. Food nearby was great and cheap traveling via Grab!
"I have stayed here before as it's inexpensive but has everything I want. Nice rooms, room services, free wifi & breakfast and I can go from the pool to the surf to the bar in less then 30 seconds, lol. Staff are wonderful, security good and local beach clubs like Finns right next door with all the beautiful people. 
Highly recommended for the budget or smart traveller."
"Stayed here a few times. Love the location right on the beach, and not far from heaps of places in Canggu, especially by scooter. 
It’s a great crash pad, but don’t expect to be watching movies in your room. TV is limited. Bed is a little firm but completely sleepable. No block outs blinds so bring an eye mask if you need ultra dark.
Will stay again."
Great location on the beach  and reasonable price
Everything about this hotel is great except the telephone in the room that not working because the cable is missing and i've telling the reception that they will replace it but they never replace it so i have to use my phone to call the receptionist
"Nice beachfront hotel, breakfast was a la carte but enough. Good hotel for surfers, has porches outside of rooms. You can slightly hear Finn's club but finishes at midnight so it was alright for us.
Water in shower was hot at night but when we took a shower at 6pm it was lukewarm (probably high usage with other rooms)..
We rented a scooter for 80k, reception also helped with arranging a driver reasonably priced.
Overall we enjoyed our stay :)"
"2 thing to beware of if you are a family.
#1 it is located between two night clubs. The walls are thick but some noise comes in. Didn't bother us too much.  #2 extra beds aren't advertised as 2022 august they were $35 night to hire which is steep by bali standards. Its not on their information page. So those on a budget should be aware of the extra cost. Nice staff. Nice breakfast. Other than the night clubs its a very chilled area in all..."
"Everything you need, beachfront, pool, restaurant, surf out the front and restaurants/clubs within walking distance. You can watch the kids in the pool and surfing while sitting under the palms. The staff are so helpful and friendly"
"Stayed here a number of times. A great location right on the beach, and next door to Finn’s Beach Club. 
Only issue on this occasion was the resort next door holding dance parties till 1am. The doof doof was great and all, but made it hard if you wanted to sleep prior. 
Other than that I enjoy staying here."
This is a basic hotel very well run in a beach front location. Highly recommended
"Good place, hotel is so good and fresh, but a location a bit far from tourist spot, best place to escape the city looking for a peace 👌🏻"
"I stay here several times when I surf in Berawa.
Due to the rainy season, there are always many mosquitoes in the room this time
But awesome staff, friendly attitude and smile, quick response, let me still choose here
The garden and restaurant by the sea are my favorite places after surfing,
But food needs a lot of improvement."
Good value and great staff. The pool is a bit worn down but the ocean is only a few steps away.
"The BEST location! Beachfront on a surf break. Opposite Finns. Lovely staff. Beautiful manicured gardens and pretty pool. I always look at other options when staying in Berewa, but just can’t find anything comparable at this price in this location.,"
"Great location, very relaxing, walking distance to lovely restaurants and a few bars. Clothes shopping too. 
Pity Finn’s is so close as a bit noisey at night."
"Fabulous stay at Legong Keraton. It’s right on the beach but can be a little noisy from nearby beach clubs on weekends. Most nights the partying ends at midnight, but on Saturday, it can go on until 2am or 3am. The pool is small, but you’re right on the beach, so not an issue. The menu was very limited, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby. I’d stay here again!"
"Good things: Lovely staff, nice pool and great surf.
Bad things: Used to be a great place, but now a little run down and extremely noisy, no block out curtains in bedroom (we had their best beach deluxe room) with night clubs both sides. We're not sensitive to noise and usually sleep ok with a bit of noise but it was impossible to sleep with loud doff doff boom boom music going until 2am. Windows were shaking and the lights from the clubs glaring into the bedroom. Breakfast was a bit underwhelming, they've changed from buffet to set, very limited menu and charged extra if you wanted a piece of toast etc. It might be great if you're 20, love to surf, take instagram photos at the clubs and party all night..."
"Every time I choice here to stay when I back Berawa for surfing. Last time I live here in 2019 
 December before the Covid. The staff are still friendly and helpful, the only improvement is the housekeeping. Tables and phones are heavily dusted."
I stay here several times when I surf in Berawa.
"Things here have declined a bit due to pandemic, etc. They no longer have the continental breakfast buffet but just a few choices to choose from a la carte for the included breakfast. Facilities could use some upgrade. Staff was pleasant enough and one female in particular working in the restaurant area was super sweet and very present. She did her job so well. Perhaps the manager of the servers. Our room was nice, clean, simple. We had a lovely little balcony and could see the ocean. Hot water was not working one of the nights but it was back in the morning. Also our a/c was awesome the first day but the second day was no longer cooling at all. It felt more like having a fan running. Perhaps it's because we left the a/c on too long? Or maybe it just needs a new filter. All in all for the awesome price, you can't beat the hotel in this location. If you want to pay higher prices, you'll get more for your money somewhere else. This worked well for us. The pool was great. The grassy area overlooking the beach was great. Make sure you're cool with dance music and house beats (we are!)because Finn's next door plays dance music all day and night! :)"
"Nice staff, friendly vibe.  Great pool and a decent breakfast.  Id stay again for sure"
"Great location & friendly staff. Food menu very limited. Nearby clubs can be a bit noisy till quite late on weekends, but otherwise, would definitely recommend & stay here again"
"Right on the beach, surf straight out the front."
"the staff is not so friendly or polite.  The service is not so good.   The hotel location is very good,  just a step to beach but the noise comes from the two biggest clubs in bali will not make your night easy.  if you are looking for quiet place by the sea. this is not the right choice. but if you are planning to stay out of your room, enjoying the beach and clubs, then you go."
"We absoloutely loved the beachfront location, the breakfast was good the staff were lovely, the rooms however were very old and dated and my pillows smelled like they hadn't been washed ever, pretty gross.  Fix up the room hygene and then I would come back"
"Great location for being by the beach but surrounded by bars and beach clubs most nights we were kept awake every night until, depending on the day either 1am or 3.30am with the sounds of loud party music. Food was also very average. Reasonably clean and tidy but could benefit from  a bit of a spring clean. The grounds are very well kept and staff lovely."
"Pros: good food, friendly staff, in front of the beach with good waves for surfing, clean towels.
Cons: there are 2 sewer outlet pipes where the hotel is so we haven’t gone for swimming with our little 5 months baby, sheets weren’t that clean and my room was way humid, do not pay for the hotel transfer because it is expensive (get someone from outside)."
"Room is good, quite big, but the amenities not really completed, simple things like toothbrush I need to ask reception, and variant food for breakfast is so so."
The hotel is in a great location and the facilities are good. The room was very dirty and sheets/towels grey (white originally). The prize they ask is way to much for what you get. The hotel is next to finns beach club and right at the beach so that is probably why they can ask so much for the rooms (compared to other hotels in Bali/canggu). I would stay here again for a half the prize!
"The location is great hence the high price. Their garden is very pretty and well maintained but the hotel itself reminded me of a dorm. The bathroom, all furniture was not clean, and old. The wifi was slow and unreliable . The breakfast was sad and bad quality. I once asked for a poached egg, and when it came it was soaking in the most sour water i ever tasted. I am not sure what they cooked that in and i don’t even want to know. I also tried a cocktail but they were all made with synthetic fruit flavoring. Felt very cheap and bad quality. I also felt unsafe. Although the do-not-disturb sign was out, once when i left, someone brought in new water. Which is nice, but there should have been noone entering my room while that sign is outside. Also the safety box was too small for my laptop. And there was at all times - literally all day-  cleaning staff hanging outside my room’s corridor, chatting and laughing very loudly, so they knew when i left my room. Felt unsafe."
"The only thing going for this hotel is the location.  Right on the beach and across the road from Finns beach club which is a must. 
Other than that, the room had mould in the corners, the bathtub looked like it hadn't been washed in years with yellow stains on the bottom, the mosquito net around the bed was torn, dusty and had stains on it. 
The drain around the pool probably hasn't been cleaned properly in years and the whole place looks like it need a bit of TLC overall. 
Breakfast was included but calling it average is being generous."
This should not be classified as a 3-star hotel. For the same rates there are much better options around.
"Perfect beachfront location, wonderful staff however the surrounding beach clubs playing 'doof doof' music till 3.00am was awful. We checked out 3 days early. Very disappointing."
"We have stayed at the Legong many times pre Covid and always loved it. What a shame we can never stay there again.  The sheets were badly stained the the towels had holes in them. The hotel is now surrounded by nightclubs and the constant base beat goes till 3am rattling the windows in your room resulting in no sleep.
This hotel is now way over priced."
"Not very clean, sheets and bedding wasn’t washed"
"The room was so old and uncomfortable, the bed and the pillow smell so bad then i have to throw them both pillow and the door. 
Kńwb"
"The hotel is in the middle of 3 beach clubs. Therefore, if you are looking for a quiet stay next to the beach it is not the place for you. Hotel is old & tired. Before the clubs were built it most likely was a good choice. Depends on what you are looking for party yes, chill no!"
Not a good location for families due to noise from the two large clubs on both sides.
"Location is good. Pool too deep , very average food and service"
"No coffee until 7am or  coffee facilities in the room, not an issue to most but big issue for me!"
Lovely staff but the facilities are so old need a complete update and look nothing like the advertised pictures. Bed linen and towels smell damp and are so old they are completely discoloured. Also very noisy from Finns next door
Unfortunately this hotel wasn’t for us. The room was old and appeared dirty and run down. The sheets weren’t changed only bed remade. The room was loud - no sleep until 2-3am. Breakfast was not nice - cold. Had to go elsewhere for breakfast. No poolside service. Staff nowhere to be seen. Sorry. But wouldn’t stay again. I appreciate you trying to get back on feet after covid and wish you luck.
This hotel is surrounded by clubs on all three sides. One club directly next door had it's music up so loud my room was shaking while the club from directly behind the hotel had a disco light shining into my room. The curtains didn't cover the windows so I was subjected to a full night of no sleep. The absolute worst stay I have ever had anywhere. When I talked to reception about it the next day they said they couldn't do anything about it. I feel as though I should have had a heads up somewhere but didn't read reviews before I booked. Only stay here if you are using it for a crash pad after your night of partying.
This hotel is showing its age but that would be OK if not for the two blaring nightclubs on either side that rattled the whole building. It was a Friday night and we were told it would end by 11:30 but was still going strong at 1:30. If you come to Bali for this scene then have at it. If not avoid this hotel and Canggu all together.
"Breakfast is very poor compared to other places. Pool is unmaintained, the pool bar is filled empty and filled with sunbeds  instead on bartender and drinks. Rooms are very basic even the deluxe version which we are staying in. The stuff is not happy and not smiling at all which is a big surprise."
"Though my visit was during off-season, I still wanted to be away from noise and the hustle-n-bustle of Kuta/Legian/Seminyak etc.  All I wanted to do was to surf, scuba dive, read, and chill, which is exactly what I ended up doing and staying at Legong Keraton was perfect, especially which included breakfast buffet, tax, and service fees.  For those who want to dine out at various restaurants, mingle with others over drinks, and have an easy access to shopping, Legong Keraton is way too out in the middle of nowhere.  However, the hotel does provide a daily free shuttle service twice a day (10am and 3pm) to Seminyak and Legian area, and you just need to find a way back to the hotel on your own  -- ask the taxi driver to run the meter and never settle for his/her asking price.  also there is a shortcut! which the shuttle takes, so roughly remember the route!).  Food at the hotel is just ok, and being a vegetarian, I was glad to have more than one choice of dish to choose from.  Room is furnished very simple; modern and minimalist style, which is what I like.  It was kept very clean, supplied with two complimentary bottles of drinking water, and bug-free.  I was worried about mosquito bites, but I didn't get a single bite unlike the last time I was in Bali staying at another hotel!!  There is a surf shop right next to the hotel if you need to rent a board, and it's reasonably priced at 50,000 rp 1 day for any board of your choice, or 500,000 rp for 1 week.  The guys at the surf shop were very friendly.  Spa services were reasonably priced, compared to spas at bigger hotels in the same class  and service charge for 1hr Balinese massage.  Everyone was very friendly and because it's not a mega resort operation, they quickly remembered my face (and my peculiar dietary preference) and were very helpful in accommodating my needs."
"We loved staying here.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and included many choices like fresh fruit and juices, breads, donuts, waffles, Indonesian breakfast with rice, stir fried vegetables, tofu, chicken, plus eggs and bacon.  It was right on the beach with a nice view.  It was a bit loud from Finn's right next door and we could hear the bass at night but that's not the fault of the hotel or much they can do about it.  It didn't last very late.  One night there was a party next door that was really loud so be prepared for anything.  The hotel was very accommodating and arranged transport when we needed it.  The pool was nice and super clean.  The kids had fun swimming in it every day and they provided cushions and towels.  I would definitely recommend Legong Keraton to anyone looking for an easy place to stay in Canggu.  We easily walked to Batu Bolong along the beach everyday and were able to enjoy the busier street without staying on it."
"I loved my staff at Legong Keraton Beach Hotel.  I would def. return to this hotel.  It was great because it was out of the hectic atmosphere of Kuta but it was close enough to travel easily by scooter.  Scooters were cheap and recommend you hire for the duration of your staff, however ensure you get an offical road map from the local diary...i think the cost was approx rp.  I discovered this on my last day and after numerous times of getting lost.  I recommend Changgu Cafe for food and also to bring some duty free alcohol as it is expensive to buy at the hotel."
The rooms at the Legong Keraton Beach Hotel are great. The have plenty of room and have a large bathroom and storage area. The gardens are absolutely spotless and the staff are always friendly and welcoming. The hotel is located of a great beach and is also located close to Echo beach where you can get great waves.
"Great stay at Legong Keraton. Stayed with a 1-year old baby and was easy (baby cot, baby chair at the restaurant). The staff was very professional and detail-oriented, and is definitely an asset to the resort. A bit outside of the ""busy"" Bali but easy reach with the hotel shuttle bus (to Legian at 10am and 3pm everyday), a cab or a 1-day car rental... So great compromise to relax and visit Bali! The environment was nice: the swimming pool (definitely for more than 10 people as indicated on their website), the beach chairs in the garden, facing the swimming pool or the rolling waves, the garden..."
"The Legong Keraton Beach Hotel is friendly and well maintained, we enjoyed our stay there. The pool is a great size and very clean also always lots of space and lounge chairs, towels etc. for all the guests requirements. The restaurant is well priced and the food is fresh and tasty."
chose legong keraton while still in canada. extremely happy with hotel.  this hotel is right on the beach within walking distance to echo beach and legian (low tide). the hotel  restaurant is nice and there is also a small restaurant next door that is half the price with a few more indonesian choices and free wifi. this hotel is for those that like quiet as it is far from kuta
"legong keraton is one of my favorite places in bali.  wake up and do a surf check after walking across the courtyard...if it looks good, paddle out before the legian crowds arrive.  place takes a mid to low tide best.  great vibe and good breakfast included.  the hotel staff go out of there way to make you comfortable and i have enjoyed coming back here every time i am back in bali and want to escape the crowds and focus on surfing...down time can be spent getting messages at the spa, eating hippie surf fod at sureti's down the road (free wifi with food) or just lounging by the pool.  be sure to take advantage of the free rides (trams) into town at 10:00 and 3:00.  this will save you the cost of taxi one way...once in seminyak feel free to shop (the bingtang store is great for filling up on necessities), do some upscale shopping or catch a taxi into kuta for some craziness and night life!!!"
"It located on the beach and the hotel also prepare spa for their customers. But if you would like to be at the city center area, may this hotel is not your choice because it takes about 20 minutes to the city center. Long Beach pleasant and less crowded than Kuta, and healthy family atmosphere. Hotel is so clean and comfortable for family who travel with children. All staff are nice and friendly, food are very good taste. The room was comfortable and clean, the grounds were well maintained and the pool was lovely. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Legong Keraton."
"When in Canggu Legong Keraton is my go to choice.. I love how it’s on the ocean and I get to swim in it several times a day when I’m lounging around on the pool loungers... it’s pretty with green green grass, palms and trees plus they were giving it a lick of paint brightening up the place even more.. 
I hire a scooter and get around on that to all the lovely restaurants, bars and sights in and around Canggu.. love Canggu.. 
I enjoy my walks in the morning on the beach.. blessed.. 
The staff are all very friendly and helpful and I highly recommmend this lovely place on the oceans edge.. I will return.."
"Legong Keraton is indeed excellent value for money. Staff were smiling and friendly. Although there were other guests in the hotel, there was space for everyone, because the hotel is well laid-out. The gardens open right out to the beach, which is great, if you love the sea or surfing. 
Rooms are on the large side, simply furnished, but more than adequate for a hotel in this price scale. Everything works, which is a big plus point, if you've been to other ""hotels"" in Bali that are crumbling due to a sad lack of maintenance. Our room (the cheapest one) was on the ground floor, near the reception and the pool, but it wasn't noisy at all. The large terrace was a bonus.
The breakfast experience wasn't fantastic, to be honest, but all-round, it's a fantastic hotel, and I would definitely recommend it to those who like a bit of peace and quiet by the beach (the hotel is near nothing very much, so it is a haven from noisy Kuta and bustling Seminyak)."
"We will definitely recommend the hotel to our friends and relatives.  Wonderful location right on the beach, we used the driver the hotel recommended to us and he was great, as well.  If we have another opportunity to travel to Bali, we will surely stay at Legong Keraton."
"I stayed at the Legong Keraton Beach Hotel for 2 nights which I booked through Agoda for a VERY cheap price. I then extended my stay through the hotel and they wanted to charge me double the price so I had to negociate. In the end, when I checked out, the hotel gave me a very bad exchange rate which I thought was kind of sneaky not to mention. I recommend you book through Agoda for your entire stay including if you want to extend. Also be sure to ask about the exchange rate to your native currency when negociating, Balinese people are lovely but they won't hesitate to make a quick buck at the tourists' expense. Good luck!"
"we really enjoyed our 2 nights at legong keraton. the room was nice, the pool was just standart, but what i enjoyed the most is laying down on my day bed enjoying the beautiful view of berawa beach. my son n husband loved playing soccer by the beach. it was just nice, not crowded. the location is not far from the happening place like ku de ta, potato head, hu'u bar etc. one thing need to be improved is the breakfast menu."
"Warm welcome on arrival by attentive staff. Easy checkin. Comfortable rooms, good size rooms. Legong Keraton Beach Hotel is right on the beach  which was great for us, Surf right out front. Would come back."
"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The location is unbelievably beautiful just at Canggu/Berawa beach so you can enjoy your meals and leisure time with the direct view on the ocean. Breakfast was a good buffet, with sufficient choices between Western and Asian food. There was however no fresh fruit juice, and the juices they served kinda tasted artificial. The staff was lovely and professional, always willing to help with a smile. 
You can also have lunch and dinner at the hotel. Food choices are very good (Western and Asian), tasty and reasonably priced. 
Some negative points: 
1. WIFI was a real pain: never been successful in our room (it seemed to only work in the reception area) and it was kind of ridiculous to have to ask for a login account + password every day, which are written on a small piece of paper.
2. They don't check whoever comes to their grounds and use the facilities, e.g. the sunbeds and pool. We noticed that there were lots of non-guests coming everyday to the hotel garden and using the available sunbeds, so that guests could not get any bed anymore. A check at the entrance could avoid this problem. 
3. The hotel lies on a very quiet part of Bali. We found it excellent for relaxing, but for others who want more facilities like bars, shops and resto's, this might not be for you. A taxi might also quite hard to get (we had a private driver, so no problem for us)."
"We spent two nights at Legong Keraton, the private garden and swimming are right on the beach. You can relax on a long chair sipping a drink while watching the surfers, have a swim in the pool or tempt the big waves on the other side. The hotel is super clean and well maintained. We loved the location, walking distance to La Laguna, by the beach, right opposite Fynn's beach club and close to a few lovely heathy food cafe/restaurant. A good place to land in Bali."
"When we arrived there was a wedding reception, which i was expecting as i read from other reviews. It was a little noisy and loud, but the staff told us that it will end at 11pm, which was fair enough. The rooms were minimal but with a balcony. But the Four posts bed was nice with a view of the beach. The hotel was well maintained. I chose the highest floor sea view. I am very happy with the decision i made to stay here! Breakfast choice was very very little. But you get a nice breakfast by the beach which is what i loved and not many hotels have this. I wanted a private beach where i can sit under the sun and surf without moving out of the hotel. The gardens and landscape were nice. Food was good from the hotel and they extended serving us by the beach as we lay there.I wasnt happy with not having a free wifi throughout the hotel, they should have at least at the lobby! All in all, we were very happy with our stay in Legong Keraton. I look forward to stay there on my next trip to Bali!"
"We stayed for two nights in a 'Superior' room, and had a very pleasant time. The Legong Keraton is not a luxurious hotel, but this is compensated for by its great location right on the beach and the friendly, helpful staff. It was extremely good value for money with the discount we got for booking through Agoda. Our highlight was watching the sunsets with a drink, then eating in the gardens to the sound of the waves. Recommended!"
"I'm a surfer and wanted to have a combined surf/family holiday in Bali. In order to do this i needed to find a hotel that was comfortable enough for my pregnant wife and son while having easy access to the beach, and other nearby beaches so that i could score daily sessions without too much effort. I found Legong through a friend who stays there regularly so decided to stay there for all 11 days that we were in Bali. The room was comfortable, the gardens were beautiful (there was always people working in them) and the location is right on Berawa beach. The staff were very friendly and always smiling, they were very friendly with my son and actually helped us quite a lot by looking after him for short periods during our meal times in the restaurant. There is also a really nice pool with a good area for children which was a big plus for us. The beach right out front has a few wave options too and a very nice beach bar (which is not part of the hotel) which has great music and a perfect view for watching the sun set. Overall, we are very happy with our decision to stay at Legong and will definitely be going back."
"We had a fabulous stay. Staff were very friendly & attentive.  We wanted beautifil gardens, beachfront position, close proximity to Echo Beach where we needed to attend a competition.  Legong Keraton was perfect for us.  Would have been good to have a movie channel."
Very clean place and right on the breach with beautiful views
"Location location location! Next door neighbour to Finns and short walk to Atlas, two awesome Beach Clubs, great pride of Canggu. Slay!
Small-Mid Size 30 rooms hotel, hence no crowd, quiet and peaceful under-tree-shades-by-the-beach sundeck moment.
Easy to find surrounding food places, all walking distance. Surf lessons just at the beachfront. Room comes with Balcony, perfect for Santai late night chat. Dip in the Pool while watching the sunset. Perfect!
Will come again."
"I'm staying with kids and elderly. The hotel has direct access to beach. You can enjoying the beach view from pool. Room spacious, staff are friendly. Breakfast ala carte."
Nice stay beautiful grounds.
"Beachfront hotel, located in crowded area. Eatery and bar are easy to find,  local shop even famous club is just next door.
Minimal hotel facilities till toiletries, no kettle for hot tea coffee, only water bottle provided. Hotel build in staircase only.
Staff is very nice and helpfull."
"The location of the hotel is beachfront and has a nice sea view. Everything about the hotel is perfect.  Just whenever there is music at the clubs at night,  you can hear all the sound inside the room."
"It is in a good spot. The hotel is in desperate need of a refurbishment. The sheets did not smell very nice and was hard to sleep in it. The interior in the room was lacking any comfort, it really needed some work, there was hair strewn all down the side of the bed and the bed linen wasn't very clean. the towels were also worn down. The hotel is kept very clean, but in general the place lacks lustre. the pool really needs to be fixed up. I don't think I will return here again. If I did I would probably stay at the White Goose. My travel friends got sick from the chicken parmigiana and that was the nail in the coffin for us."
Loved being on the beach and close walking distance to a lot of what the area has to offer. Good breakfast too.
Great location
"We’ve stayed here a few times. We would go back. Staff are lovely, location is good but there are a few things to consider. It can be noisy with the two clubs either side. The rooms are good but they need a deeper clean and buff up. The linen needs renewing. It’s been hard times and hopefully things will pick up and allow the owners to get back to a full menu and better housekeeping. There are the best views of the sunset in Bali from here and the grounds and pool are great. See you next time."
"A quite, older hotel nestled amongst the beach clubs of Berawa. Sitting on the grass at Legon Keraton overlooking the beach with a cold beer is one of my favourite things to do in Bali. And I used to live there so have done a lot of things in Bali!"
We love this hotel and will go back for sure just be mindful that people and businesses are still struggling I asked for and upgrade via email and paid extra then we did not use so we instead had a big credit come time to leave they said we got a bigger better room than we asked for and used the credit in fact we didn't get the room we asked for but try and get your money back is really hard we have been here many times and will go back just remember to see what your getting before you pay that's all
"Had everything we needed , enjoyed laying out by the pool on the grass. Maybe not the best location but a easy walk down the beach to several restaurants . We stayed on the weekdays and we had no problems with noise. I would recommend this Hotel , we felt it was good value for your money.

Good
"Decent place to stay, on the beach and close to the clubs.  Room was basic and run down.  Noisy club next door.  Terrace above the beach is beautiful.  Probably better places in Cangu for the price."
"Great location if you surf or just want to chill out. You can slightly hear the music from the beach club next door, but it’s chilled out music and not loud"
"Great location on the beach if you want to stay in Canggu and party. Although because it’s close to Finns you can hear the music till all hours. Wouldn’t recommend it for families. But a group of young party goers is more appropriate for this resort. The rooms are tidy but very basic. The wifi drops in and out often. Breakfast didn’t have that much variety. If you live omlettes you’ll be happy because it’s mostly what you’ll be eating, along with a curry and fried rice. The price is fair for the location and what you get."
"Perfect location if you love waking up to the sound of the ocean as it is right on the beachfront.
Finns Beach Club is next door and some days/nights were a little loud due to the music playing.
Rooms are standard but very clean, could do with a microwave for baby bottles.
Staff were not helpful on arrival and a bond was to be paid which we were not advised beforehand. 
Other than that a great stay."
"This hotel was just lovely! It wasnt too big and oozed balinese culture.  Staff were very friendly and helpful and we felt very secure in the hotel. Great location, so close to the surf and restaurants. 
Mini mart/Circle K a fair distance to walk if needed so get a taxi. Rooms were simple but included everything you needed. The pool and layout of the hotel were ideal with small kids including a much shallower end for those that cant swim. Thank you for a great time and we’ll definitely be back!"
Stayed here many times over the years just because of the location. The WIFI is weak if you can even get a signal! Staff is clueless! Security guards were really nice though.  Beds are hard as a rock. Skipped the included breakfast Most of the time because it is always basic and poor! The location is only good thing about this property. I wish new management would take it over and make some improvements. This resort has the potential to be something great with the right leadership. Too bad. At least the price will never go up at this rate.
This was more like a boutique hotel... small and great value for money we are use to staying at places like the padma ... anantara etc .. this is way smaller but so cute and relaxing and the bonus is the spot right on the beach and with Finns across the road you can’t go wrong ... a small poool but with minimal rooms it wasn’t crowded in fact no one was in the pool except a few little kids which was perfect as we went with children ... the only down side was the room was very basic still nice but not fancy like padma with all the extras ... I would stay here every time I am in the area
Location is perfect in front of the beach and rooms are comfortable and clean. Only downside is food isn’t good and there’s a lack of facilities.
"Wonderful location .. lovely grassed area swaying palm trees over looking the ocean ... unfortunately the BeachClub bar has a negative impact . 
Our room was not very clean on our arrival which was disappointing ..."
"Good pints .. location , lovely staff, great brekky buffet.. pesky things  .. no hot water .. tepid is ok. Cold is not ok 👎.. they tax 21% on top of every meal and drink .. makes it an expensive night.. without telling you first 🤔🤔👎 .. my niece and her family came to visit .. they charged $30 for to come into our hotel .. so so rude ... cleanliness as in all Asian countries is a bit lax .. no clean sheets and we stayed there for a week!! Feel like we are trying to be ripped off at every turn"
"This place is great for the price. Great location in front of the beach. Nice pool. Breakfast is basic buffet, but does have an egg station. 
It is right next to a huge nightclub. I sleep badly, but with earplugs I could sleep OK, so it isn't that much of a problem."
"Love this place !  Home away from home.  Perfect place to relax.  Fantastic location with grassed area around the pool, palm trees, surf straight out the front.   Great for families, couples and singles.  Staff are lovely, very friendly.  Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable.  Will be back again soon!"
"It is what it is and if your after simple, relaxing no fuss then this is the place for you. Dated but still ticks boxes for location,  low key accomodation on the beach."
loved it!! Highly recommended. Clean and secure. Friendly staff. Great location
We have stayed at this hotel twice and would definitely go back again. It is not fancy or luxurious by any means but it has everything you need and is close to great restaurants and shopping and situated right on the beach.  The staff are lovely and it is clean with lovely gardens and a great pool. We had a really nice time there with our two young children.
Great place to stay.  Staff very accommodating for our large group.
"The location is ridiculously good, and the local restaurants are top quality."
"Location, staff and hospitality, rooms and setting all top level and at a good price. 3rd time I’ve stayed here and will be back again"
Location staff price perfection
"Awesome location, good breakfast, little bit outdated interior though."
Location is right at the beach making it easy to go the beach any time. The rooms are spacious and clean and ecofriendly (no single-use plastic water bottles and towels/sheets are only changed upon request). They also offer connecting rooms for family with children.
Nice small hotel in a great beach side location
"I booked the hotel because I wanted to be close to Finn's Beach Club and it is certainly that. It is directly across the road so was very convenient indeed. Unfortunately this also meant that if you are not partying the night away at Finn's one evening, you are going to be kept awake by the music that is very loud, even when inside the room with the doors and windows closed. Breakfast was very basic and a bit disappointing compared to most places in Bali. Apart from these issues the hotel is nice, right on the beach. If it were in another country it would be a good hotel but in Bali the standard is so high that this one felt pretty average for the price."
Great location right on the beach and many good restaurants close and walking distance along the beach. Large rooms and adjoining rooms available so would be great for young children/grandchildren or older friends group.  Friendly staff and some with good knowledge of English.
"I come back time and time again.. it’s really good to see the staff walk around the customers lazing by the pool or ocean side on the loungers asking if they would like a drink or some food.. they never used to do that.. that’s really good for customer service and generating extra cash for the hotel.. love the beach.. love everything.. oh yeah, Finns is next door with its music but life goes on.."
If I stayed again and probably will I would stay away from rooms 6 and 7 as they  are on boundary of neighboring Finns which is quite loud but it wasn’t a deal breaker. Food was pretty good service is very good but could do with a kettle in the room as getting a cup of tea was nearly as the same cost as a Bintang. Breakfast was good recommend the omelette and the pool area is outstanding.
"My husband and myself always return to this Hotel as we love the quiet location, the relaxed vibe, the beautiful crystal clear pool, lush green grass and gardens and white Hampton style cottages and buildings all situated right in front of a great surfing beach. The staff are lovely, the restaurant has lovely food at very reasonable prices. The resort is never overly busy and crowded which is why it is so relaxing. People who complain about this hotel due to not being a 5 star resort with a million $$ price tag due to its location are obviously looking for a different type of resort. This hotel is for relaxed people looking for a relaxing holiday in the best location. Some of the best restaurants in Bali are situated within walking distance and/or a short drive away."
This hotel I chose for its location and convenience to the beach. Staff and welcoming but not really bothered. It a surfers hotel but it's overpriced and the owners know this I'm sure it will turnover regular surfers and beach lovers but nothing fancy just simple Bali charm.
"This is one of the few properties right on the beach in Canggu. I highly recommend it.  Great rooms, nice pool, food is decently priced, skip the pizza.   The board rental shop in front has good prices, 100,000 for the whole day."
Returned for another visit to this amazing hotel we love this hotel the location is perfect situated on the beach in Canggu next to Finns the staff are so friendly and always happy to help in any way the rooms are spacious and the bathroom is a decent size and clean breakfast is your average Bali breakfast at most hotels loads of restaurants near by will be back
"I was here twice about 10 years ago and really loved it. I still love the property, but a large night club has gone up right across the street and a new one opened while I was RIGHT BEHIND the hotel! Not to mention all of the other growth. It is no longer the quiet getaway I loved but if you like night life and hanging around a beautiful pool and surfing it's for you."
"Adjacent to the boisterous waves of Canggu beach, and the busy Finns Beach Club, this quiet family oriented hotel is a tranquil place in the bustle of Bali surfer scene."
"Stayed here before and didn't disappoint. 
Only negative for me was the shower was never hot, and the drainage system around the pool needs replacing as it's beyond cleaning.
Can't comment on the breakfast as always ate out.
Very relaxing and a great location right on the beach front."
Good hotel but a bit pricey and a small incident occurred whereby the reception did not issue a receipt upon collection of deposit and had a small argument trying to collect it back. Overall: not to bad
Love Legong location right on beach pool area is a lovely grassed area the rooms are quite spacious and clean good water pressure and the air cons work well beds comfy lovely big bath towels the only downside is that the restaurant is mediocre but step outside and you have a huge selection of cafe and restaurants only metres away we will certainly be back
