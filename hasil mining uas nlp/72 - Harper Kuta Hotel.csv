"Great location, not too big, comfortable beds, delicious breakfast and beautiful pool! We really enjoyed our stay ...thank you"
"This amazing hotel gave us the best start that any couple would want, Amazing location... it on the street where u will find everything ranging from clubs, to stores which are open 24*7, easy accessibility on bike to all the location... amazing breakfast.. We travelled and stayed here from 6th oct 2022 till 12th October 2022.. and had a blast"
"I've been to bali 5 times and i've stayed here for all 5. Pre-Covid & Post-Covid. Even after Covid hit, the streets & shops around this hotel is this bustling ! Love the location & hotel staff really assist us in many things like utensils when our 2am Grabfood delivery came without."
Nice stay here.. clean & comfort .. have a good staff.. good location.. many reataurant and shopping store around the hotel..
"Staff is kind, helpful, and nice. Swimming pool is clean and also they provide towel for swim. 
Pros : clean room and near kuta beach and beachwalk
Cons : a little bit noisy and breakfast just so so. But you can order online food here. The location near to famous bali culinary."
"Best located hotel to stay in Bali. Near airport, night clubs, shopping centres, close to beach. Rooms were very clean and spacious. Staff were very friendly and food in the restaurant was very good too."
"Located in the heart of Kuta, this is a nice hotel. We had a leaking aircon and the team came to fix it right after.
We were only staying for a night before flying out from Bali so we didn't get to see much. The breakfast was ok and the room is comfortable. Despite being on a main street, it wasn't too noisy when we were there"
Good location if you want to stay in the middle of Kuta busy street... only the noise at night time as the hotel located right in the middle of all lively night entertainment in Kuta made the music sound at night bit difficult to sleep
"the staff was so kind and helpful, the location is really good... near from restaurants, kuta beach.. easy to find...
the facilities is really good too..
and the most important is not too far from the airport...
thank you"
"the location is near to many shops and need to walk about 15mins to the beach. the nearby pub so noisy until 4am, though the staff offer to give the earplug, but i am not used to it so i didn't use it. breakfast is tasty and the pool also nice."
"Great location 
Walking distance to everything 
Clean presentable 
Towels was sooooo soft 
Rooms overlooked pool"
"Room: deluxy
Very big room, tidy, but just little for clothes. Shower room is fine just not much place to put things. 
I like they use the water tank in hallway so you can refill the water by yourself and save the plastic bottle :)"
"Such an awesome hotel, the staff were wonderful and caring, boutique type rooms, clean and comfy beds, I would defenitely stay here again AAA+++"
It's a wonderful place to stay. Nothing to blame If going to Bali again will stay at
Love the hotel.. the staff is so helpful and kind.. ❤
This is best location if you happens wants to do nightlife as well. Everything is walking distance at the same time the beach.
"It was a nice stay , the hotel is located in the middle of the busy street which gives you a good Bali vibes . Suitable place for those coming over for party . The only prons was the “salt water «
Not comfortable to take shower"
"It has great location, right in the middle of Legian street. And though this hotel is not big, it has proper parking space and entrance."
"good food. good hotel. friendly staff. only the aircon leaking the next morning but the staff fixed it very fast. overall, very good"
Close to everything. Breakfast was amazing! Pool was clean and very nice. On jalan Legian strip. Many restaurants and clubs around. Staff so friendly.
"it's clean, close to the beach, and friendly"
Good location right in the middle of Kuta. clean and very helpful staff.
Hotel staff was so nice very helpful and the location is really strategic and happening especially at 11pm & above. Will repeat again in the future..
I stayed here every time i visited Bali
Always good choice in bali
"I love the location, easy to walk around and close to the beach n clubs. The most important thing the staff are friendly and the room is clean. Deff will stay again"
"Not first time on this hotel, The hotel in general is excellent, clean, the staff are excellent, the cleanliness is excellent, the swimming pool is great, the breakfast is excellent with many option of food and teasty and problematic, there is no gym and its recommend  hotel"
4 star Budget friendly hotel at a party place. Loved it!
Walking distance to sanur harbour and the famous Warung Mak Beng. Super helpful and friendly staffs.  Clean room.

Was great to be back!!"
"PROS-
Huge hotel room, 
Had private access to the Pool,

Superb hotel location
CONS-
Their hotel travel desk is expensive compared to others"
"Great hotel room, surround by lot of bars n pubs.. close with kuta beach.. location in the heart of legian."
Good to have a very friendly staff
"We came across this hotel while looking for a replacement for our terrible stay at a certain hotel. Everything is great! However, it is close to clubs and pubs so your room will be vibrating till 2am ++. The location however is great! Super convenient"
"Plus points: Friendly staff, strategicaly Located, clean room
Minus: the breakfast is lack of variety and they are tasteless"
"Everything is Good, TY"
"I enjoyed staying at Harper. Stayed there for 5 nights. Walking distance 
to the restaurants, Beachwalk Mall, and Kuta beach. Good selection of breakfast food."
Best located ..for shopping and night life ....
Recommended hotel for buzy traveler 😁 nice room and nice staff.
"The dishes are fantastic, the location is strategic, and the ambiance is soothing. The price might be competitively affordable."
Great staff. Clean(it matters a lot to me) always . Always accommodated my very late house keeping request and made my room. Will come again.
"strategic location for young people, near the crowd ^_^"
Excellent location friendly staff and very comfortable bed

- Aircon isn’t that cool in some rooms (my friend requested for tech check and they’re able to fix it)
- Buffet breakfast w/ limited options (ate here for 3days)
- nearest BK is 8-10min walk
Not bad compared to other nearby hotels with same price range.
Will come back!
Value for money —> 8.3/10"
nice and cozy
"Hotel room and bed is spacious comfy. Amenities for toilet provided. Good location and easy access to mini marts, restaurant and entertainment."
My visit was great. I stayed in deluxe room and I felt that the price was not worth the room ambience.
Nice hotel & walking distance to beach
Semua perfect. Sukaaaa
Great location
Clean and nice hotel
"The room is very clean and tidy, the location is good (although it is quite noisy as it is adjacent to several nightclubs), the food is good and diverse. They need to repair the hot water installation, and the leaking air conditioner (probably just the case for my room)"
Great location and friendly stuff!
Good Location near Food and shopping
Is good for young traveler as is in the middle of kuta
Well location to discos is so close you dont even have to leave your room to listen to the pounding bass till 4 am every morning.   Other then that the place is very nice.  Highly recommened for the people that are clubbing all night not for people going to sleep early
"We got a small room for around $35 per night on sale and for this price I don't think you can do any better. Rooms are modern and clean, staff are friendly of course and the location is good. The hotel hasn't been amazingly maintained but all the room facilities were excellent. As this is basically in the centre of the night club area you should expect some noise late at night but we never found it to be too loud as the rooms are relatively insulated. We were also in the room closest to all the street noise."
"Clean hotel and that what matters. Breakfast buffet is ok but always watch for ants in your bread or croissant. Staff are very friendly and provide excellent service . Location is nice but music is too loud until 4 in the morning from several nightclubs next to the hotel , very hard to avoid the loudness and craziness . Location of the note is that n the heart of night life clubs and bars and aggressive street sellers. 10 minutes walk to the beach 🏝"
"Nice hotel, clean, comfy bed , good location"
"Good hotel and comes with a good price. Location is great, you can just walk to the beach or just strolling in Legian Street."
"The staff are amazing and if I come to Bali again I would definitely go to this hotel again 
Breakfast is good too"
Located in legian road :) the deluxe room was pretty big.. great staff and clean room..
"overall is acceptable, just my morning shower was interrupted when the tap runs dry. The hot water is also not consistent. Another problem is the noise from the pubs in the middle of the night, so loud that certain part of the ceiling was vibrating."
I really enjoyed my stay here 🤩 the staffs are friendly and helpful
Centrally located. About 10mins to Kuta beach (I think). Walking distance to shops and restaurants.
"The perks of staying in this hotel is that it's quite near to anywhere in Kuta. It's not too noisy now because the night activities kinda slow down because of the covid, so I didn't hear loud sound that disturb my sleep. Hotel is clean, but not too big just enough for 2 person. Breakfast just so - so, I don't really like it, but it's edible. The downside is only the water in washtafel is salty.. I brush my teeth with the mineral water provided."
"Pros: 
- Staff there were super friendly and helpful
- Great location walking distance to kuta
- Felt safe despite being surrounded by nightclubs
- Room was clean
Cons:
- Noise from the surrounding clubs till about 4am in the morning (for us we didnt mind the noise we were prepared)
- The aircon is leaking and its not very cold. 
- Breakfast was limited but the food is tasty. 
Will definitely stay here again when coming back to bali!"
Good location
Best Hotel👍
"Overall is good  ,just the hotel is located beside a club , every night start music loudly  at  10pm -3.30am . Suitable for young people ."
"Staffs are well trained, friendly, alert, and always try to make guest comfortable. Our complaints was leak at wash basin which overlooked by housekeeping. Cleanliness is ok but can be improved. Some guests might sensitive to cleanliness. Overall Okay."
We used this hotel as our 3 night quarantine stay. The staff were lovely and everything was really nice and clean
Superb location. Worth the value.
Will come back again
one of the best hotel in Bali!
"This hotel is located close to pubs with very loud speakers operate until very late. Unless you plan to sleep very late and wake up very late too, this may not be suitable for you. Location wise it is very close to the Kuta beach and at the centre of main Kuta tourist area where you have easy access to restaurant foods, convenient shops, and street market."
Lovely stay
"It was the perfect stay before we moved to another location since we arrived late in Bali. The hotel is located in the heart of Kuta, which means you are close to dining, entertainment, and shopping. Nighttime can be a bit noisy."
Hotel is in good location and rooms is big and clean
Best/Hot Place for travel
"A bit far from the beach. 
A nice breakfast buffet, but can be a bit crowded when peak season. 
They provide water dispenser at every floor."
Everything is great except the choice for breakfast. Perhaps because of short of staff.
Best hotel best location best staff best food. Right in the heart of Legian. Walking distance to Beachwalk mall and of course the Kuta beach. Breakfast were nice. I will stay here again when i visit Bali in the future.
Location is great
"Plus : available mineral water Dispenser so we can get any time. 
Minus : my room have two or three Mosquito"
"It’s the best place if you like to chill clubbing and shopping.
Moreover, the staff are very helpful and friendly. Room is quite tidy and clean as well. Breakfast also not bad. 
I wanna give 4 stars for overall."
Excellent service from the staff.
"I have stayed here a few times, its on the main street where the clubs/ pubs are, but being off the street far enough you dont here any noise. Its good for me"
This hotel is great if you get a room towards the back of the building. The rooms that face the front of the building are incredibly loud & noisy with all of the nightclubs that are along the street running until 2-3am. Gratefully we were moved/upgraded to a quiet room for our second night and slept well. The rooms are ok for the price and breakfast had variety.
"I have stayed here a few times, its on the main street where the clubs/ pubs are, but being off the street far enough you dont here any noise. Its good for me"

"I have stayed here a few times, its on the main street where the clubs/ pubs are, but being off the street far enough you dont here any noise. Its good for me"
I have stayed here a few times and never disappoints. Nice rooms. Friends stayed here also
"It is mostly bars and pubs along the street. You can expect loud music banging your room at night. I am personally a quiet sleeper so staying in the most lively area prob not a good choice. Hotel is nice and clean, staffs are attentive. Hotel provides earbuds, if you need one, simply ask. I would recommend this to travelers who don't get distracted by noise when sleeping. Location is excellent, go to nearby bars or clubs by foot in a couple of mins"
"we had a pleasant stay in Harper Kuta. Initially 2 nights and later 3 more nights.  The room are good considering the price tag and location. Good breakfast, easy access to the kuta beach, restaurants,  shops and clubs.  
The front desk girls  as well as all the staffs we met are always smiling and helpful.
There was an air conditioning issue during our 1st couple of nights stay but we had a good air conditioned room in last 3 nights.
Apart from a lost incident which has been addressed well by the hotel, we had an pleasant stay."
"Everything is great , however The expectations is when we have booked for long time and the room have to be ready when guest Arrives. Learn from my experience  i have waited for almost and hour."
Location is in Legian.
Good place to staycation!
"I have stayed at this hotel pre pandemic. Obviously things have changed. Nothing wrong with my room, nothing wrong with staff, however, the hotel now seems to cater for more Indonesian and SE Asia guests, hence, the breakfast options is tailored to their needs, not western needs. I obviously prefer western food for breakfast and there is limit as to how many eggs you can eat any style. 
Another problem, and I should have known from previous visits, the hotel is close to nightclub scene, so if you are an early bed time like me, be prepared to listen to constant boom, boom, boom music until 4am.
Sorry, but it will be my last stay."
It’s near the night clubs in legian so kinda bothering my rest
One Step to have vivid night life experience
"I booked this hotel because it was close to the airport and located on a vibrant street with lots of restaurants to explore. 
If you're sensitive to noise, be warned that the clubs outside plays loud music until past midnight. Also, I didn't have hot water in the morning and I assumed it might have been because it was around a time when everyone was getting up. Warm water had arrived by the time I came home from brunch so it wasn't a big issue."
"Breakfast, recommend to put aircond
Due to it very hot, in-term of food is on average"
"With the access through lanes, kuta beach is so close.
Legian is also a very nice location itself."
The location is close to the places that we wanted to visit. Breakfast not bad.
"Great location clean friendly staff pool little bit fresh for my liking sun doesn’t shine on the pool much 
And it’s beside a night club so at night you you hear the base"
nearly night club
best hotel to stay around legian
"If you plan to feel a busy night life in Bali, recommend this place. The traffic is quite jam, so be careful if you plan to catch the flight."
Good stay.
"It was a nice hotel, not as clean as other hotels in Indonesia but the staff was very (!!!) friendly and super nice, they did everything to make us feel comfortable."
"Near Kuta beach, stone throw away from bars and restaurant. I didnt experience the noise coming from nearby bars some reviewers are talking about. My room’s AC is defective though. I didnt like the food in their restaurant. It is too spicy and too salty for my taste."
It is worth to choose
Walking distance to many bars and restaurants. Hotel breakfast is pretty decent too.
Recently I stayed here for one night before moving to their own Neo Plus for four more nights just stone throw away. Compared to Neo Plus Harper is more expensive but I found Neo Plus is any day better. The rooms here are not well maintained  in comparison Neo Plus looks more clean and hygeine. I had 6 rooms booked here for my guests and my only intention of staying here was to assess the hotel for my futur guests and for that I really doubt if I would recommend this hotel again
"Booked this hotel because of all the positive online. But very disappointed.
However, this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in Bali and luckily I have only booked one night.
1. The room looks old and dirty. It doesn’t look like a 4 star hotel. There hair on the bed and the bedsheet looks dirty. The room is more like a 3 star hotel standard 
2. Couldn’t sleep well due to the noise from the club
None of the review mentioned that the noise from the club next door is very loud.
And it lasts til 3-4 am
3.There is no security latch. It is being removed. Ironically, there is a sticker to remind guests to lock the security  latch when they are in the room. How am I supposed to lock the security latch when there isn’t one?
I have stayed in many hotels in Bali with the same price which are much more better."
I arrived at Harper late at night after a long flight and was warmly welcomed by the hotel staff. Unfortunately my room (#329) was close to the street and the music from the surrounding hotels reverberated through the walls making it very hard to go to sleep. If you want to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Legian and steps away from the nightclub scene then this is the hotel for you.
"Used to be good. Recently i booked and was given a nightmare room. The aircon leaked so badly. Told the receptionist and they agreed to help us once we are back from our errands. Notice that someone entered when we r away. Thought that the aircon was already fixed but nope. Leaking thruout. On our 3rd night, we booked another last minute hotel and the balance stay in Harper just gone like that."
Happy to of stayed there. Central and fit the purpose. Lovely staff and would recommend it
