"Traditional style resort hotel, room was very comfortable, gardens were beautiful. Pool was great with a swim up bar. Staff were very accommodating. Food/breakfast was just OK the only thing that could be improved."
"At first we didnt expect to see something very different here.
The hotel got lots of ""back to nature"" touch, like a miniature jungle inside the hotel.
It got a big tree where squirrels lives, lots of birds coming to the garden in front of the rooms, fish ponds and gardens full of trees making me feel like im not in the middle of busy Kuta. 
It's like an oasis in the middle of the beach.
My kids really loved this hotel since they can see and feed lota of animals here.
The room is also spacious and comfortable.
They also provide clothes rack to dry the wet clothes in every porch of the room which is a great plus since we went to swim and play in the beach a lot.
The stafss are also very kind and friendly.
I really recommend this hotels, especially to travellers with children."
I’ve been here many times. This time with my wife and daughter.  Safe and easy place to get around.  Beach across the road. Shopping supermarket next door.  Huge clean pool.
"I had a great stay in Grand Istana Rama Hotel. The staff are approachable and the facilities are almost complete. A week before I checked in, I made a request to book a room facing the garden and the hotel management granted it. For those who wish to enjoy the night, this hotel has a bar with live band that could serenade you with good music. Even though some parts of the hotel were under renovation, it did not distract you from enjoying your day at pool or walking in the garden. I will definetely stay here in my next trip."
"A great hotel with great location. Worth the money to stay here in Bali. The staffs are friendly, however there are things that need to be improved such as the Bali Massage package that couldnt be cancelled due to our packed schedule. Try to be more flexible for the customers. Please improve.
All in all, a good deal as place to stay in Bali."
"Can't fault this hotel. Did have a room at rear so a bit of a hike to the pool. Bed was very firm but got used to it quickly. Clean, friendly, very close to Beachwalk and beach. Plenty of restaurants to choose from."
We arrived around 1:30am from our delayed flight and the service at Grand Rama Istana was so immediately supportive and quality service from staff. Felt so grateful being there and especially their comfortable beds and the convenience of having a tasty breakfast there too. Totally recommend it here!
"We had a week stay, and no complaints. There was some work going on to redecorate the hotel after two years of closing, but that didn't bother us. For a fair price the hotel let you have a car and driver a full day to take you to wherever you want to go. This is a much better solution then rent a car or scooters for going on your own. The traffic is insane for someone who hasn't been to Bali before and road signs are scarce.
This hotel is highly recommended by our family"
"great location, opposite the beach, staff are superb  rooms cleaned daily, breaky buffet has delicious Indonesian food plus toast,  pancakes  or waffles plus mix of cakes daily.
great value accomodation right next door to beachwalk mall, and only a short walk to Legian Street or Poppies 2"
"In the center of it all.  Very convenience location, clean room, friendly staff. Totally recommended."
"Great traditional Hotel, The gardens are impressive and well kept. the swim up pool bar is great and the restraunt is to die for."
"In the center of it all.  Very convenience location, clean room, friendly staff. Totally recommended."
"First time in Bali and had a great time. The only thing was the shower, the holder on the wall was located a bit too high, a bit troublesome for me (156cm tall). And water spilled out to the bathroom floor no matter how I tried. Otherwise everything was clean and sufficient, staff were all kind. Definitely going back."
"me & my friend stayed there for two nights. location, food, staffs’ behaviour, ambience, cleanliness - everything is value for money. a staff named ARYA was very helpful. next time also i will stay at this hotel."
"It was very nice and comfortable staying here. Also, good location, close by Beach and can enjoy surfing right infrontof hotel.
All staff is kind also.
Highly recomend here!!!"
"It looks old from outside, but when your in the room, you can feel it's not that old. The room is huge with terrace. The aircon is cold. Full amenities in bathroom. They have hair dryer. The room is complete. The hotel itself had a big pool & a big beautiful yard. The hotel location is beside beachwalk mall, in front of kuta beach. The staff all so nice. It is really a good hotel if your looking for Balinese vibe."
Surpriced us for free gala dinner.  Everithing is ok.  Nice hotel for everithing...will come  back for next new year if stil have time..
Great location and facilities were clean and well presented.  The Hotel has been painting and upgrading facilities which is great to see.
"I stayed in this hotel for 7 days with my siblings. Good location, friendly service from staff, good facilities overall. The pool and the bar are excellent places to chill. I'd stay here again."
"What a great Balinese oasis. Lots of gardens, birds and fish ponds. My room grand deluxe was comfortable, spacious, had heaps of drawers, hanging space and nice decor. The staff turned an outside light on for me every night. I loved this place. Value for money and brach across the road."
Great location with many restaurants and shops.  Nice breakfast with much variety of choices. Friendly staffs.
"We stayed here for 10 nights. Very comfortable. We wanted to be close to the beach, bars, and restaurants. There is a nice pool, restaurant and bar on sight. Beachwalk mall is right next door. Everything is convenient. They made us feel right at home."
"If you want to play at kuta beach and beachwalk mall
This hotel is one of the answer
Near to kuta beach and beachwalk mall
Best budget hotel"
"Grand Istana Rama Hotel is a wonderful hotel. Kuta beach is only a few metres from the hotel entrance. The amenities offered here are second to none. Room is clean and the staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating. This hotel is ideally located near many restaurants and shopping centres. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here. Would highly recommend."
Good place for staying near kuta beach.
This hotel is a great location straight across the road from the beach rooms are very clean older style Bali beautiful gardens bar and restaurants out the front and close to all amenities
"Very strategic location, near beachwalk mall and kuta beach with Friendly Price...Recommended!!"
"price, location, swimming pool, clean envirnment fit high rating"
"Very near the beach area, near the mall and food places to eat. You can dine in their restuarant."
"My second visit to Bali, and stayed here itself.
I liked the location right next to the mall and beach.
The resort has a nice large pool which one rarely comes by om this kind of room price.
The rooms are spacious.. my AC wasn't working efficiently on thr first night, but this was promptly attended and fixed.
The bathrooms could be lit better, just one light isn't enough.."
"Location is so nice  in front of beach .Breakfast also good .But We have to request and ask to give bathroom accessories ( Shower gel ,Shampoo ) .Everyday They always come and clean the room and put one set only in bathroom .Actually we are two persons /room .But they put shower gel ,shampoo for one person only .Everyday We have to call staff and ask to give for two persons . I not understand why they make like this .I understand First day they put for one person. But second day they should know this room stay two persons .we stayed 4 days ."
"Located in front of Kuta Beach, beside biggest Mall in Bali, Friendly & helpful staff, great food."
This was my 5th stay and I will stay again as the staff are amazing
I love the hotel for its locations and staff
"Kamarnya bersih, staff ramah, menu restaurant lengkap harga terjangkau lokasi didepan pantai Kuta dan akses mudah fasilitas lengkap menyenangkan buat keluarga"
"My family really enjoyed the time at this hotel. Super handy for beach access and the staff always smiling, friendly and helpful."
near the Kuta Beach so every morning before go around Bali we play at beach.
"Excellent location, staff ready friendly, place was clean."
"They have great customer service, he didn't discriminate local people, good location, good hotel, very recommended."
"Even though we would recommend this hotel, we found there was no connection with the staff - they did not go out of their way to connect with their guests like other hotels we stayed at. For the same price other hotels included breakfast and offered us a ground floor room at no extra charge which is very important to us. It's right across the street from the beach and next door to Beach Walk mall which is really nice."
"The place is an old property but very well maintained.. The location is excellent as one can right away walk into the beach. 
The pool is great and well maintained. 
Great hospitality and very good staff."
"I really love this hotel, clean and the staff so polite"
very reasonable price right on the beach
Msive room lots of green and plenty of grass area for my one year old running around
"Stayed and for price , absolutely can’t ask for anything more! Clean room , coldest aircon I’ve seen in my life lol, beautiful gardens, smiling staff, live music and dj every night, pool and pool bar . If grand istana would take criticism to improve- food quality and choice very low standard and if improved will make big difference - try modern presented , authentic bali  instead of bad western . Anyway I’ll be back 100%, see u Xmas and New Years if not before. … oh and best mango Sisha in bar 69"
frandly staff nice black fast good location recommendations come back soon
"Great location. Very friendly and helpful staff. Restaurants had delicious food at reasonable prices. Pool was huge, clean and well kept. We would definitely stay here again."
This hotel is in a great location in Kuta and the staff are so friendly and helpful.
"Basic rooms are much better than what you get in the 3-star hotels nearby for almost the same price. Awesome breakfast, helpful staff, reasonable prices for transfer."
I m going also here
The room is fully equipped with basic amenities and very comfortable
"Lokasi strategis,,view bagussss,,, petugas hotel ramahhh"
Worth every penny. Won't regret and will come back to istana rama
Great staff and best location
"This is great place to stay with a good breakfast buffet right by the beach. We stayed here for 5 nights and had a wonderful time.
Only problem was the shower wasn't really good pressure. Other than that, amazing!"
Had a nice stay here.
I love everything and the hotel is perfectly loacted across the beach
good choice to stay...
This hotel is the best for me..
Everything was good
"Great room , great pool , great staff, great spot . I'll be back again"
Some rooms are noisy as they back on to BoardWalk shopping centre & cars constantly driving into carpark drive over something metal that goes click click & that is all your hear from 8am to 11pm & it is very annoying if you are trying to sleep
Central to the action beach and party zone
we stayed here from the 20th Dec through to the 27th Dec then returned on the 5th Jan till the 10th Jan I recommend this hotel to everyone Wonderful friendly staff rooms are great    My only bad note would be the breakfast very very ordinary I tried it once that was it I ate out every other morning    but prime location lovely staff my favourite would have to been J LO  at reception  but I will be going back with out doubt   Neville
Lokasi bgs dpn Pantai Kuta
"I love the location, the beach is cross the road. Love the hotel garden. Can't complain about the room.  My room had a balcony.  Room is big but not modern.  A/C was good. Wifi was good. For the price I paid, I really can't complain about anything."
Great place... beautiful location... close to everything xx
Clean hotel and room. The furniture is a little bit old but still nice. Friendly service. Perfect location at the Beach!
Good value for money
"Very pleased with hotel, would visit again, and recommend."
Location was superb !! Near to the beachwalk and Pantai Kuta
Location perfect if you like the beach especially . Will stay again.
"Stayed solo at the beginning of my trip in Bali. Location of hotel was great being right near the shopping center and across the road from the beach. Staff were very friendly. Room was good. 
Downside were the mosquitoes in my room and towels weren’t the cleanest.
All in all a good stay."
"It looks like it was created as an all-inclusive resort, but it got engulfed by a propsering city. Now it looks a little older that it's bright new neighbors, but the rooms are big, and it has some beautiful gardens."
Worth surely the room price.
"everything was nice, especially location was superb"
BEAUTIFUL PLACE... great location xx
"Beach Infront, great breakfast and staff."
"Perfect location, very nice staff, and great hotel restaurant."
Everything was great
"Friendly staff, if you can’t climb stairs this is not for you ,ask for ground floor nice breakfast and quite clean"
Nice hotel. Best location good air-conditioner staff friendly
Great location near Kuta Beach and Beachwalk shopping mall.
Amazing stay :)
The room was good. We only stayed for a night but the room had all necessary facility. The room we checked into had no facility of elevators or lift. That was the only drawback for the room. Otherwise it was a fine arrangement. Please provide coffee and tea in the rooms since you already provide electric kettles in the rooms.
Great value for money. It would be best  to have lift when u occupy higher area rooms.
Close your eyes and book.
"Wonderful hotel, wonderful location, very good helpful staff, wonderful environment.
Few choices of restaurant and cafe available here."
"Fabulous location, staff very friendly, prompt attention when called regarding issue. Breakfast was ok reasonable selection of food.
Cons: air con was not really cool asked for it to be checked but didn't make any difference. Shower head would be great if you were 190cms or above otherwise you have to shower holding the shower head at all times. Smell present when you would initially run shower but then settled. 
Overall great location but room needs updating. Wasn't happy to pay 80% of room rate for late check out"
"Nice old school rooms. Beautiful premises. Clean washrooms with 24-hours hot water supply. Many options for the breakfast everyday. They even take special requests for breakfast for free if feasible for them. Attentive, polite and welcoming staff. One star less though just because the buildings don't have elevators - I honestly think it was very dumb of whoever came up with this idea of not having elevators in buildings that have more than two floors."
The location is the best as Kuta beach is just opposite. The beachwalk which is a shopping mall is less than 5 mins of walking. Otherwise it’s a basic no frill hotel with enough to stay comfortably. However the aircon wasn’t too strong and we had to push our bed forward to feel  it.
"Generally the hotel is quite old in term of room utilities. Secondly, the stuff like water jug is not clean and the shower water have no hot water at all with little of water. Overall comments is quite ok, depends on you whether mind or don’t mind."
Great location and staff where very friendly
"The hotel is very near to the beach, shopping centre."
"This place is located  in central  Kuta Beach. The staff  was great, breakfast  was killer. Rooms are decent  for the cost. I would stay  there again."
"Overall, the room was decent. Nice balcony, nice large room and bed. The bathroom could be better....both the shower and using shower in the bathtub flooded the floor. And the shower temp was usually scalding.....The staff was very friendly."
Old hotel but great location! Just next to Kuta Beach. Clean and big swimming pool 👍
"Make sure the aircon works good , mine doesn't get cold enough but unreal location and staff are good"
"I stayed at this hotel 25 years ago, so its been a long time.
I came back because the location suited my needs.
I
My fault for not paying extra for a ground floor room  up and down the stairs killed me. 
Loved the restaurant location overlooking the beach, however, the new shopping centre has been a big downfall for this hotel. Traffic in and out of shopping centre is madness."
"There’s bathtub in the bathroom, room is clean and quiet"
Located right across the road from Kuta Beach
"On the beach, good breakfast options, Check In was a mess and were overwhelmed with guests... Overall a good option"
highly recommended
"This hotel has good location, nice clean pool but that's all. Its good for 2 nights, but I would not recommend it for a longer stay. The rooms are old and outdated, the bathroom was not clean and some of the furniture was in really bad shape, needs to be replaced."
Have already reviewd
"This hotel is too old. Air-con leaking, bathroom not functioning well with smelly musty towels provided"
Location is excellent. Kuta beach is across the road. Reasonably good
I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone as it is so good it would be constantly full and be hard to get a room.
Place is convenient. Breakfast good. TV is old and really small. Rooms are good size.
Located at the prime location and near to amenities.. only problem encountered was with the hotel room as the shower room drainage was clogged and shower water always overflows to bathroom and toilet area. Reported to front office but seems not resolved and have to bare with the problem for 7 days and no room exchanged due to no room available. Other than drainage clogged issue overall was quite good stay there.
Very relaxing place
"We stayed over xmas and new year 7 adults 3 kids. Rooms are slowly being upgraded, our 'superior' room that hadn't been updated yet was very average but clean. The hotels location is its best selling point across from the beach, moments walk to BeachWalk shopping complex etc. The pool is nice and the swim up bar is handy. Endra who manages the pool par is lovely and remembers us each time we go. The only thing that really let them down this year was the choice of band playing in the front bar each night. We sat there new years eve for a buffet dinner and party - the hotel hired a 'rock' band which screamed out loud heavy metal songs all night, the singer was truly awful. Not one person got up and danced. We ended up moving away to the pool area to escape the noise. Such a shame i think  if they had played something more family friendly or even just melodic it would have been so much better."
The room was nice and the courtyard is nice. The food in the restaurant wasnt good and the band add night wasnt good.
"Stayed this hotel second times for 4 nights, 14-18 May 2022. Rooms cheap for money but mosquito inside the rooms and breakfast was poor( same menu everyday).  Pool are only suitable for children."
While the gardens are immaculate the age of the hotel is showing. Pool is ok. Hot water to rooms not good. Housekeeping excellent. Breakfasts need a shake up. Overall reasonable value.
"Close to the beach, but not for me as very old and run down. Couple of cleanliness  issues.  Restaurant staff and porter great. Wouldn’t stay there again."
"Location is great, near to mall, beach and waterbom
But the resort is quite old, so the cleanness are just normal
Breakfast is just normal, not tasty
Hope they can improve their cleanness and food"
"Location are good and outdoor garden is nice but the rooms are old, toilet are dirty didnt bother to use toilet for hygiene reason. Frontdesk Staff Females could be more friendly as they were blatantly cold.i changed hotel after a night"
"Hotel is across from beach and next to beach walk. Stuff service is not good especially at restaurant and breakfast. Restaurant meals are plus plus. Hotel is not close to indo marts ,laundry, massage or local shopping. If you like staying at the hotel and being around the pool this could be for you. Sunset at the beach is across the road. This is an older style hotel."
"Dissapointed with this hotel, very old, and dirty, the water have a smell and sticky.. the only good with this hotel only the location, very closer to the beach, you only need accross the road and very close to the beachwalk only 3 minute walk to there"
