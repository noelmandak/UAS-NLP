"What a hidden gem!! My wife and I had the most wonderful 4 nights in the pool villa. Totally worth the upgrade. We will be bringing the whole family at the end of the year and won’t bother looking at any other accommodation. This has everything we need- lovely staff, pools, massages, location, food, drinks, room service and airport pick ups. Thank you once again- Kim and Merredith!"
"Great location, a 2 minute walk to Beachwalk Shopping Mall and Pantai beach. Lots of good and cheap massage salons and restaurants around the vicinity. Staff were helpful and cheerful all times. Love the Koi fish pond and the resident squirrels….room always clean to a good standard. Enjoyed our stay very much. Will return to stay again."
"Finally returned to Bali after covid and stayed at Kuta Puri once again. We had a room with it’s own plunge pool which was the perfect temperature! Some small pools we have found to be to cold as they are shaded. 
Grounds and restaurant are all as they were pre covid and we have booked again for December.
Unfortunately some of the local restaurants ect have closed but there’s still plenty to find not far away. Also there’s a very good money changer on the right side of the road as you head down poppies lane towards the beach."
"Stayed at Kuta puri several times
Over the last 6 or so years and have always loved the location, the friendliness
Of the staff and the most beautiful tropical gardens.  Rooms are a great size and the private pool bungalows are the best- my choice of accomodation every time. Won’t stay anywhere else"
"We rented a lower bungalow and although it was a but further back it was awesome. Air Con worked great, bed was comfy, staff were super attentive and very close to Turtle Rescue and beach. We loved it here so much we extended our stay for a few days. We walked to grocery store in mall and bought some snacks and beer. Breakfast was excellent and filling every morning. We would stay here again!"
The hotel is really a great break in the heart of kuta. Once you walk around all day up and down poppies lane or enjoy kuta beach the property is very quiet. The entire grounds are 1 big garden so its feels extremely peaceful. They can accommodate for all groups and decent value with location. Staff is very nice and will fix any issue very quickly withing minutes of a phone call. I've stayed here few times and many more to come.
"Very happy with our lst stay at Kuta Pura bungalows, recommend to all my families and friends."
"Great pool villas we had a small pool more that enough and the larger pool villa 
Liked the room layout of small pool villa more as don't need need full kitchen as eating out
Breakfast is great 👍 
Pool bar excellent
Very busy with returning customers 
We will be back 
Staff beautiful"
"Very happy with kuta puri Bangalow
Room very very clean.
Am glad I booked this hotel
My next trip it has to be kuta puri bangalow"
"The positives: The location being at the beach end of Poppies 1 is convenient with plenty of food  and shopping options within a 10 minute walk. 
Staff are absolutely gorgeous, they couldn't be more helpful and attentive, especially when our 9yr old had Bali Belly on day 2!! 
The grounds of the resort are super quiet and peaceful. 
We had interconnected rooms which were nice and big with a large ensuite with bath/shower and also an extra semi-outdoor shower.
The 2 pools are a good size and central to all rooms/Bungalows, one has a swim up bar and the other has a shallow area with a large shade umbrella. Plenty of lines around the outside of the pools, and while we were there we had no issues finding somewhere shady to sit at any time of day. 
The constructive: The deck around the pools is starting to wear, so make sure you have shoes to avoid splinters. The buffet breakfast is a little limited, especially if staying for more than 3 or 4 days, it gets a bit boring. While the location is super convenient, it also means getting hassled quite a bit for transport/shops as soon as you step out of the gates which got a bit frustrating. 
Overall: Will 100% stay again, the Kuta Puri is locally owned and the staff are the most lovely people."
"Great location vary clean an well maintained hotel an gardens,  great buffet breakfast and staff were wonderful, would definitely stay again 😀"
"Love Kuta Puri , we have had many stays over the years and love the location usually get a bungalow with private pool that is very nice."
Just the quiet relaxing holiday I needed....will return for the rest of my holiday life
"Large rooms, lovely gardens in a great location, short walk to beach, once again beautiful Bali staff."
"Just a quick 1 night stay before our fight out and I enjoyed it. The location is great, almost beachfront in kuta yet it’s surprisingly quiet and peaceful inside the hotel grounds, like an oasis. The hotel could use a little update but everything was clean and in good condition, just not modern. We had an early fight to catch and since we were going to miss breakfast, the hotel packed us a breakfast the night before."
"Amazing location right near the beach, staff were friendly and extremely helpful, will definitely visit again :)"
Stayed in luxury villa with pool as we previously had.  So peaceful  and staff and facilities fabulous- This is now our ongoing chose of hotels.
Beautiful well kept hotel great rooms staff are amazing always get a smile and a hello would not hesitate to stay here again.
Nice clean rooms- daily room clean-swim up pool bar- restaurant/bar- great location in Kuta for shopping or the beach.
"An oasis of old world Bali, quiet & highly recommended."
"During my stay, I got quite I'll and had to be transported quickly to a hospital. The Kuta Puri staff arranged everything and used the hotel car to get me there. I tried to pay for it later but couldn't, it was ""their duty"".
After my return to the hotel, many asked about my well being. 
The bungalows are very nice, relatively large, but why we will return has all to do with the very friendly staff attitude. Our hats off to them!"
"Great staff, always happy to help. Bungalows spacious and clean. Gardens impeccable"
"I stay here several times when I surf in Kuta reef.
Due to the rainy season, This time, the ground in my room was wet all day, but the staff immediately changed the room for me after responding.
But friendly staff, kind attitude and smile, quick response, let me still choose here
It's the awesome staff, friendly attitude and smile, quick response that make me always choose this hotel and want to come back here."
"I had a great time at kuta puri Bangalow 
Staff was great .the breakfasts was fantastic .will stay again for my next trip"
Staff are the best.  Love everything about this place.  Will continue to stay here when in bali.
"Traditional Hotel witha good touch of Balinese. The room is spacious and clean. Although furniture is old, but if like the vintage type, this hotel is good. Walking distance to the Kuta Beach and Kuta area."
Best value for money accommodation I’ve encountered in Bali.  Staff are superb and can’t do enough to accommodate all requests.  Highly recommended!
"This hotel resort is in a great location close to the beach, restaurants etc.  The rooms are very clean, staff are great, the pools and surrounding gardens are lovely.  Great hotel for families."
"The hotel is just about 50m away from the beach and very close to malls and mini marts which is great and was the reason why we chose this hotel. 
Hotel’s landscape was well maintained although some of the water fountain are not working so there are alot of stagnant water in them. Maybe they should fix them.
Rooms are a bit dated (we stayed in the family room) but clean. Initially, had issues with the aircon’s condensation but they quickly fixed it. 
They do not have plastic linings for the bins which is probably an effort to go green just like some part of Bali is doing but I found it rather unsanitary so we bought our own bin liners as we had diapers and food waste.
The rooms and surrounding area of our unit were full of mosquitoes. Informed them to spray and they did. We also bought our own spray and coil which then did reduce the number of mosquitoes. 
There are 2 pools. Only a small section for kids to plat though. Other parts are deep.
Breakfast was okay and basic. Can get quite squeezy when its crowded at the bread + coffee corner. Loved the bread + crossaint though.
For the price and location, would say it’s worth the money!"
Well positioned  clean great staff and food. No negatives. All positive
Accessible to many shops and restaurants in Kuta. The staff were very polite and helpful.
Value for money and good location. Highly recommended for family
Very convenient location at Kuta beach.
"I have been to Bali 3 times and stayed in places all over from to Gilis to Pemuteran. The Kuta Pura is by far my favourite place. The rooms are comfortable, modern and clean and located close to the beach. The grounds are impeccable and the pools are lovely. I usually stay in the luxury terrace suites but recently stayed in the luxury bungalows which were well worth the upgrade. Beautifully furnished and nice touches. I would highly recommend this resort and would definitely stay here any time I come to Kuta."
"I love kuta puri bungalow.
My next trip I will stay there.
Staff was great"
Great place to stay when you're in Kuta with family. Staffs were super helpful 👍👍
"The Kuta Puri is a lovely traditional bali garden resort in the heart of Kuta & just across the road from Kuta Beach.
The gardens & pools are the perfect oasis to relax in after the hustle & bustle of Kuta.
The rooms are always clean & comfortable.
There is wifi available throughout the complex.
Staff are super welcoming & professional.
Breakfast is buffet style with plenty of choice & an egg station.
We love this spot & keep returning year after year."
"Yes, Yes, Yes super"
"Good hotel, good pool, good garden, very suitable for family. Like it."
コスパ、スタッフ、ロケーション、ビーチアクセス、very good ‼️
Booked in to stay 5 nights and extended as we liked it so much. Very relaxed feeling their with very friendly staff.. The only thing I could fault was the king size bed in our bungalow was very firm to lay/sleep on.
I stay here several times when I surf in Kuta reef.
I stay here several times when I surf in Kuta reef.
"Good breakfast, very nice resort"
"Convenient to explore Kuta beach and surroundings. With friendly employees, good facilities and breakfast, this bungalow is good and recommended"
We have stayed at Kuta Puri many times over the years and it has consistently been outstanding.  We stay in a luxury villa which has plenty of room and is just so peaceful.
We stayed in the luxury bungalow this time and I would highly recommend the upgrade. Furnishings and amenities were awesome.
Great location and friendly staff
Cottage with private pool was awesome 👌
"I highly recommend Kuta Puri Bungalow and Spa.  I have stayed there several times over the last 25 years, and I am glad I chose to stay there again.  It was easy to get to the hotel from the airport, and the check-in process was good, even though it was late at night.  There’s a 24-hour mini mart right outside the gate, and restaurants nearby.  I stayed in an upstairs standard room, and it was very nice.  It was clean and spacious, with a good balcony.  The breakfast was decent.  Although Kuta can be hectic and noisy, this hotel is quiet and calm.  The grounds are beautiful, with a fantastic pool area.  And, it’s a 3 minute walk to Kuta Beach."
"Once you get beyond the gates, you wouldn't know that you're in the heart of Kuta. A 4 min walk to the beach, and close proximity to alot of shops and eateries in Poppies 1 and 2.
The staff are very friendly, breakfast buffet has an egg station, and a modest selection of Western and Asian foods.
I would not think of staying anywhere but KP Bungalows on my next trip to Bali!"
"Nice place, good breakfast, very quiet and friendly stuff, big plus nice garden."
"Old Balinese style accommodation. Large rooms, great balcony, good sized bathroom but I'd prefer more room to move in the shower. Two decent pools, well treed grounds and location perfect. Very close to beach and good local restaurants."
"Central Location, Near to beach and  easily accessible from Airport."
"The whole hotel was lovely and clean.
The breakfast buffet had great variety which was different every day.
the staff were all very friendly"
"Near to Kuta Beach, Starbucks & Beachwalk mall."
Location is good. Quite and peaceful. Clean and tidy. Breakfast is good also. Good facilities.  I’ll recommend to others.
Many mosquitos around so pls use repelant. My daughter got bitten n she has dengue now.
"Excellent location
Good breakfast 
Friendly staff and helpful.
Great pools with bar."
"The bungalow was so traditional and the outdoor bathroom was amazing,  we loved it.
The resort is in an excellent location, close to restaurants, transport and shops.
The staff were so warm and friendly, they really made you feel welcome.
I would recommend this resort very highly."
"Great location and staff couldn’t be nicer.
Will stay again"
"Staff was friendly, facilities were clean tho our unit could be more well lit but had a great stay.will definitely be back"
The garden was incredible and created such a peaceful setting. The staff were always helpful and kind and we really enjoyed our stay.
All round an excellent place to stay the grounds are beautiful and great value for money . Breakfast and room service  average eat elsewhere
Have always wanted to stay here and finally have. Great location just inside Poppies 1 and close to the beach and restaurants. Large comfy bed. Aircon was great and the swim up pool bar and cocktails were amazing. Will be back :)
Had a great time at Kuta Puri. The staff were great. Meals at the restaurant always nice and have an egg station at breakfast. Overall a lovely time definitely stay again.
"We arrived at around 10pm to a room with x2 single beds when requested a king bed. The next day we asked for room with king bed & they were fully booked so they upgraded us for 2 nights. The room we were upgraded to was awesome! I will book this next time we stay. The staff were great the location was fab. The pool was warm but often is in Bali. The eling spa was good and reasonably priced. We ate at the restaurant once for tea and it was nice. The breakfast isn't bad, but you have to ask for sausages, bacon and baked beans etc. I would stay here again the aircon was nice & cold and walk in shower on end rooms only, witch we had were great. Thanks Kuta Puri"
"Original style Bali hotel with lovely gardens. Our cottage was an older style with ensuite with a walk-in shower. Nothing glam but neat & tidy.
Staff are friendly & efficient. Buffet breakfast has enough variety & choices to satisfy.Two refreshing pools with sufficient sun lounges.  We keep coming back."
2min walk to beach comfortably bed 3 poos and staff are great could be a better menu atm
"Amazing resort with beautiful staff, awesome food and lovely rooms.. Such value for money.."
Very nice traditional Balinese architecture.
"Rooms need mirrors. Breakfast menu needs more options.
But overall value for money, as it is very close to Kuta beach."
"Nice relaxed connected rooms for the family, nice breakfast and friendly staff."
"Decent place to stay for short stay, good location"
Staffs were nice. There were mosquitoes and other bugs in my room. It’s Bali so it might difficult to avoid them. The room was spacious but no not clean enough for me(my standard for cleanses is high).
Quite and nice
"Great location, close to beach, restaurants and shops. Very clean  room , friendly staff and yummy breakfast"
"Great location, clean and friendly"
"only 1 thing  negative the wifi is not strong in rooms we had.
the breakfast is excellent"
"In the heart of Kuta. Used to have loads of restaurants around the area. Due to the pandemics, more than 80% of them are closed, also the shops. Think they will take some time longer to recover. If you do plan to travel to this part of the world, please drop in to Bali and help to get this place back to it's former glory......"
nice breakfast.but do not recommand the room cottage garden.All other are good to very good
Good clean place good staff
And you cannot modify your booking.Cannot keep the booking and just upgrade your room
"Kuta Puri is a traditional (almost vintage) hotel at the very beginning of Poppies Lane. It has a surprisingly large garden for its location and there are two medium-sized swimming pools. Some rooms are in bungalows and some are in block-style buildings. All rooms have a balcony or a porch. What we liked most is the sense of tradition - hotels like this tend to get rare in central Kuta. Also, it is close to Kuta beach and shopping. At the same time, reasonably-priced restaurants are just around the corner. What we didn't like was a very weak WiFi in our room (almost unavailable in the evenings)."
"This hotel is really well located, a minute walk to shops and restaurant/bars and a 2 minute walk to Kuta beach. Staff are friendly and helpful too. What let's this place down is that (1) it needs an update because of it's tired and rundown looks and (2) the poor standard of room hygiene and cleanliness."
"Tried to scam us on the way out, but overall great service and company"
"The bungalows, pool, grounds and everything is lovely, but for some reason there are many roosters on the property. Last night and despite three requests to reception we've been unable to have one removed from next to our room and have had very little sleep.
I expect this in more rural areas of Bali but in Kuta I'd like to get a better rooster-free nights sleep.
Unless they change this I'd avoid this hotel, there are other quieter options"
I had planned the trip for my couple client and got the reviw from them that the hotel is not hygienic and comfortable. Our guests complained about lizards and insects roaming around the rooms and toilets. This is completely an individual experience after booking for 2 nights. I hope they rectify these issues and improvise their service.
It's for families
"When travelling through Kuta, you do realise that Bali is part of a third world area. busy streets, cars and motorbikes go everywhere, and then you turn off of the street in Kuta Puri Bungalow Resort......and WOW!
perfectly manicured gardens, spotlessly clean guest areas, rooms to real feel comfortable in, FANTASTIC.
We had a 'superior' room with balcony over looking the gardens, every morning the sun came up and this view of heaven presented itself to us. I cannot praise this enough, however remember that just outside the main gate is fabulous chaos, fantastic restaurants, and great shopping.
We are already planning our next trip, and we are quite fussy......."
"I've been staying at this hotel for 27 years now. There are continuous upgrades but they still keep the Bali charm. Many of the staff have been working there for a long time and this reflects on the management of the hotel.  I usually stay on my own but this time my husband came with me.  He was impressed with the Luxury Bungalow. The comfy bed, excellent wifi, good choice of English language movies and shows on the TV and he was able to watch live AFL on the Aussie channel. The restaurant food is of a high standard and there is a good poolside menu. The location is a couple of minutes walk to the beach with plenty of shopping areas near by.  The Kuta Puri Bungalow will remain my preferred place to stay when visiting Bali."
"The resort is a nice place to stay over all. The location is so good, very near to the Kuta beach. If you wanna go shopping, go to bars or go surfing, here is a very good option. The environment here is very good, the resort looks like a garden, so many trees and flowers in the yard. The swimming pools are all too deep (2 pools , deepest 2.0m & 1.8m), not so friendly to the beginning swimmers. The house here built wonderful, rooms are all villas and bungalows. But the room facilities are just normal, not very good. Sadly I found some yellow stains in the bed covers. The staff here is very nice. 
After all, Kuta Puri is a nice place with a wonderful location and a nice price."
This is our first trip in Bali. Read reviews before we booked.  Everything is great! Walking distance to beach.  Nice and quiet inside the bungalow. Beautiful garden. Fantastic pool.  Breakfast was good with different choices every day.  Top scores for friendly staff and services.  Little wears and tears in our room but not a major concern.  A little foul smell came from the sink hole only when you shower.  I told my wife we may stay somewhere else on our next trip for a change but she has specifically mentioned that she wants to come back here.  So we will be back. Thank you to all staff @ Kuta Puri for making our trip wonderful.
"Actually, I don't like to stay in Kuta area, too many people, terrible traffic.
Fortunately, I decided to stay at Kuta Puri Bungalow. This hotel just like a totally different space in Kuta, I felt quiet and peaceful here. 
I will not stay Kuta area next time I visit Bali, but if I have to, I will choose to stay Kuta Puri Bungalow again!"
"Only 5 minutes walking distance to the crowded Kuta beach, however when you entering the Kuta Puri Bungalow the atmosphere automatically change to ""calm & relax Bali"" .
The staff very helpful.  And just in front of the hotel you will find Guardian, and abundant food. 
Not to forget on mention that you can simply go to Kuta Beachwalk mall by foot.
Surely recommended !"
"Beautiful, large, tranquil gardens.  Nice pools. Two minutes walk to the beach. Reasonably priced food close by. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Yes,  helpful!  Twice we had noise problems (once from construction work, once from noisy guests at 4am) and both times the staff fixed the problem.  
I have stayed at several big hotels in the area (Sheraton, Hard Rock, and others) and I would never choose them again. Kuta Puri is my new Bali hotel of choice. 
Note: there are mosquitoes, however if you take basic precautions they won't bother you. 
The tap water is not drinkable even if boiled, unlike in some places.  This is a minor issue,  really.
I look forward to staying there again!"
"The Kuta Puri is a great Hotel for all travellers. It caters for everyone. There are 2 pools end to end. One has a kids pool at one end with some shade.
The other end is deep. The other pool is deep. The temp of the pools is just perfect.
We upgraded our room on arrival to a Bungalow right near the pool. It was lovely and spacious. It had a verandah to sit out on.
The room was a little dark so we had to use the lights during the day. They were even a little dim.
The bathroom is outdoors and huge. It was a little hot out there so I suggest storing your toiletries inside as face cream and makeup melts.
The Gardens at the Hotel are beautiful and the location is excellent, very close to the beach and Poppies one for shopping and Restaurants.
I would definately return again."
"We have recently stayed with 3 adults 3 children in 2 superior balcony rooms for 13 nights. Check in and check out process was super smooth. The gardens and grounds are beautiful, very well maintained. A hidden oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Kuta! So close to the beach, perfect for the kids. Cannot wait to visit again next year and see the restaurant area which is currently under construction.  Thank you Kuta Puri Bungalows for a wonderful and memorable holiday."
"Have stay at Kuta Puri many times. This place is a hidden gem located at the beach end of Poppies 1.
The resort is tradition Balinese style with great gardens and renovated rooms.
The location is excellent across the road to the beach,right among great shopping and close enough to the night clubs.
The staff here are Awesome nothing is too much to ask for and always have a smile and willing to help.
The Grand Deluxe rooms located on the ground floor are great value.
The resort has a swim up pool bar,kids pool and soon to be renovated restaurant.
I can highly recommend this resort."
"We have stayed at Kuta Puri on numerous trips to Bali and it never disappoints.  Even thought you are in Kuta - Poppies I, it is extremely quiet.  The staff are outstanding.  We stay in a Luxury Bungalow at Kuta Puri.  Recommend."
"accomodation was great, comfy beds with large rooms. The food at restaurant was good too. we found Kuta way to busy for us, & beach had lots of rubbish on it, so that was dissappointing. Even though we'd never stay in the area again. I can definately recommend Kuta Puri bungalows as a lovely oasis in the middle of kuta & by the beach."
"This was our 3rd time staying at the Kuta Puri Bungalows. This occasion we stayed in one of the Bali Bungalows which are much better than the standard room and worth that little bit extra.

We were allowed to check in early (11am) as there was a room available which was not originally booked for us, so that is exceptional service.

The room was very clean, smelled nice and the porter was very kind showing us all the hotel facets and room amenities. Though he did linger a bit too long waiting for a tip at the end which is both uncomfortable and annoying. I don't tip just for bringing our bags to the room - its your job mate. If that costs money, then I'll gladly carry them myself.

The pools are fine, but way overchlorinated. If you open your eyes underwater the surface of your cornea will have a few layers burned off on contact! LOL. But on the positive side, there won't be any nasties living in that chemical soup!

The hotel grounds are maintained extremely well. Each afternoon a small group of musicians play traditional Balinese music in the hotel grounds which is lovely.

One thing that needs dire improvement is the breakfast. The omelettes were either too runny or burnt. The fruit looked a bit off and sometimes tasted sour. There was a very limited breakfast menu on offer.

On a positive note, the bar is fairly cheap. 20k rp for a small bintang and 50k rp for a genuine Jacks and Coke.

The location of this hotel is great, 100m from Pantai Kuta and taxi transport and smack bang on Poppies I where you can haggle your life away over a pair of 'authentic' fake Dolce Gabanna sunglasses or dirty 'fu*k me Rhonda' singlet.

Kuta Puri Bungalows is a decent hotel, one that is comfortable for the most part, but could do with a few improvements.

We will stay again."
"Kuta Puri is set back off the main street (across from the public beach).  It is an excellent value for the $$!  Great pool and a nice breakfast buffet with good wifi.  Kuta Puri is a very short walk from the Matahari Mall/Grand Inna Kuta and tons of other vendors and restaraunts.  You can't go wrong with this choice!!!  Oh, 120,000R to the airport by the hotel."
"I spent 11 days in Kuta Puri Bungalows and thoroughly enjoyed it. Only two minutes walk to the beach and the location is pretty much in the heart of all the nightlife action. After some boozy nights I liked to chill by the pool, sunbath and swim. The gardens are pleasant and you feel you have all the privacy you need in your own bungalow."
"My friend and I stayed at Kuta Puri in a grand deluxe bungalow. This was my third time at Kuta Puri but have stayed at quite a few different places over the years. This is definitely my favourite for staff, breakfast and pools!"
"The Kuta Puri has wonder accomodation, beautiful gardens, warm friendly staff who have worked at the Puri for many years.
Its a gem , close to all amenities, around Kuta,  once you walk off Poppies 1  into the grounds of the Kuta Puri you’ll find a hidden ossis."
"Our stay at the Kuta Puri Bungalow and Spa was very pleasant, staff were great and very helpful during the time of a five night extended stay due to volcanic ash. The place is in an ideal location with lovely manicured gardens close to the beach, shopping centres and places to eat. Will stay here again."
"Loved the Kuta Puri. Typical Bali Style hotel with gardens surrounding the hotel,2 pools and great breakfast. The location in Poppies 1 is great for Kuta shopping,and 2minute walk from the beach to watch the sunset :-)"
"We always have a great stay at Kuta Puri. Lovely staff to greet you on arrival then you walk through the beautiful old style Bali grounds to your room. It is excellent value for money, great omelettes, fresh fruit and croissants for breakfast, nice coffee too! Pool area comfortable and large enough to have your own space..Booked in again for next year already."
"Beers by the pool, rest on a sun lounge after a day out in the hustle bustle of Kuta. Our bungalow with outdoor shower was nice. Movie channels. Restaurant food was good. All in all we enjoyed this hotel, the gardens are beautiful and well kept."
Verynice place and very nice staff
"Very good property. Very close to beach. Only thing is limited option for vegetarian food. If that can be improved, it would be great."
Lovely resort with phenomenal staff.
"Kuta Puri Bungalows is conveniently located on the beach end of Poppies 1. They have all the necessities for a comfortable,affordable stay. Breakfast is provided. It's basic but enough to get you going. The pool is great with a swim up bar and reasonable prices. I would definitely recommend this accommodation."
"Whenever we did google maps it always mislead us and we always got lost. The lane is narrow, no car can go, lot of one ways near by so reaching the hotel was a lot of pain"
"Value for money, great staff, good location"
This place is a slice of heaven in Kuta loved it didn't want to go home
"It hurts me to write this review, but they tried to double charge us and other guests at the hotel upon check out. We were having a great stay until they tried to charge us twice for the same service that we'd already paid for. Other guests told us they had the sake experience. Kinda sad to leave this review, but I have to."
Excellent resort in most happening place of Bali.. just few meters away from beach and lot of options for shopping in and around. Staff is very good and helps us in all the things. Breakfast also have sufficient options.
The beach is near by but has so much trash and pollution you are not allowed to swim there.  The neighborhood is low end and feels unsafe. Liquor in Bali is outrageously priced.
