"Nusa Dua was amazing and Merusaka did not disappoint. Worthy of a 5-star review. Various food selection during breakfast. Rooms are cleaned everyday, it is big (has twin beds, a couch, rain-shower and even a bathtub, bathrobes are also available). It has a real Bali feel to it. The place is luggage friendly (they also have a buggy), attentive and accommodating staff,  and has many restaurants within the property. I like that it is also a beachfront hotel. We enjoyed our stay. I greatly recommend you book your stay here as well. Cheers!"
"The pools and beach access + beach view are the best in Nusa Dua with good price.
Love the more minimalist style architecture with modern up-to-date vibes (not like the other resort hotels in Nusa Dua neighbourhood which scream dated, too gloomy-dark woody classic from the 80s and 90s or 2000s vibe).
I really like the landscape outdoor beach view from the hotel. It's beautiful and open space, with safe distance from the beach line. Not too close from the main buildings and rooms like other beach hotel. Feel more tsunami safe.
Spacious room for Deluxe Access Pool.
Healthy protocol & good hospitality service.
A good beginning of year vacation of 6 days.
A half day check out extension with good price when we requested due to late flight was facilitated by Merusaka."
"We just returned from a glorious 3 nights at Merusaka on 21-24 Jan 
We stayed in villa 1
Amazing hotel wonderful staff clean private pool and amazing toiletries. Breakfast wonderful fresh and staff always smiling x will be back. Thank you for An amazing get away. Thank you so much
Me and Mrs Omar yassin"
"We would highly recommend staying in this hotel! Rooms and villas are amazing, the river pool in the villas are fantastic, staff is friendly and kind, it’s clean, it’s on the beach, a few restaurants and shops in walking distance and right on the beach.
Couldn’t get any better - we will be back"

"It's located in Nusa Dua ITDC (Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation) area. The lobby is wide and spacious. All of the staff are all helpful and friendly. The hotel has several buildings, so make sure to read the hotel directory given to find detailed hotel information.
To reach the room, we can either get on a buggy or walk. We'll get numbers which indicate the building number, the floor, and the room number. Since the area of the hotel is pretty wide, you need to walk or just ask buggy to help for going back and forth.
It's a beachfront hotel indeed, so we can play at the beach easily. They provide shower and water tap near the beach for the guest to rinse. There are some pools as well and they're wonderful. The room is clean, spacious, and comfortable, but it'll be more perfect if there are more lighting on the way to the room.
The breakfast is various (Chinese, Western, Indonesian) and there's kids corner as well. The restaurant is wide enough (indoor & outdoor). In my opinion, it'll be better if the beverages station located in the middle of the restaurant, so we can order directly and don't need to order to the waiter/waitress.
Overall, it's a memorable and wonderful experience."
"My stay at Merusaka was enhance by small staff gestures.

"The best beach area in Nusa Dua.
Great room (go for pool access)
Food very good.
Staff so so friendly
Great value for money.
Close to town centre with plenty of restaurant (cheap & not as cheap) and shopping.
Close to Bali Collection
Huge pools including an awesome dive board pool with swim up bar.
Don't waste your time anywhere else, thuis hotel (resort) is the one.
Stayed in a few in Nusa Dua, but we will be back or our 3rd stay here in the very need future. hopefully"
We booked here for three nights in the private villas with a pool - they were beautiful - super clean. The staff were amazing. Super lovely and willing to help with food allergies in the restaurants. Definitely recommend !!! Especially if you want a little relax relax
"We love Merusaka - the beach in front is great for safe swimming and very clean. Workers rake the sea grass and remove any trash daily.  Their huge buffet breakfast is a highlight. The pool is beautiful and spacious. Rooms are very comfortable and we were pleased to have a choice of TV stations that were in English (CNN, CNBC, BBC, etc).  Very short walk to a busy street full of restaurants, shops, laundries, grocery stores, spas,etc.  We really enjoyed walking in both directions along the beach boardwalk, past many other luxury resorts."
"Best affordable price hotel at nusa dua, i was travel with my family, the room was clean, tidy, spacious. The view was amazing, the breakfast was awesome. Everything in this hotel was memorable make us want to visit again. Thank you merusaka"
"This is our third time. It was called a different name then. Since its changed names i feel it has a newness about it. The staff seems so much more motivated to please. The breakfast is amazing!! The best in the world!! The facilities is just fantastic! 
We will be coming back on a regular basis."
"I’m so glad we chose to stay here for our first trip to Bali. The grounds are impeccable. Staff are so friendly and go above and beyond every day. 
Rooms are beautiful and clean and I cannot wait to return."
"Highly recommend staying here. Very clean, great location and super friendly staff. Some great food options in the hotel or cheaper restaurants not too far down the road."
"Expectations (i.e., room quality, beaches, staff, kids playgroud, and breakfast) are met with the money you spend here. You shall expamd the kids playground in the future for a better facility."
"I’ve been to a Bali several time but wanted to try out Nusa Dua, and decided to stay here. It’s a very large hotel but seemed relatively quiet when we were there, and there were plenty of sunloungers, The staff were lovely and friendly, and beach was nice and clean. There is a bit of seaweed here but nothing too bad. We lived it a lot for the price we paid and would stay there again happily."
"Wonderful stay at Merusaka Bali. Room was very nice and well equipped. Hotel staff, esp during check-in  and breakfast were courteous and very friendly. Food was aplenty and quite tasty. Special shoutout to Mr. Dicky & Ms. Flo at the reception counter. Tqvm. Will definitely come again!!!"
The place has clean pools and the view from this hotel is beautiful
"Everything about Merusaka was great, from the very comfortable room with excellent bed and huge free standing bath to the buffet breakfast and the pizzas served at the beach bar.  Staff were amazing! Thoroughly recommended. Tip: We stayed in a pool room (Uma) which was very private."
"There are beautiful Beach and pool.
My daughters had a great time in here.
All staff are very kind.
The guests came from various countries and we were able to have a valuable experience."
"So beautiful! Paradise clean beach in front of 4 amazing infinity pools!
Pool bar is so good with great cocktails. Service is 7 star 
Restaurants lovely!  Rooms are roomy and so clean and big! Pool access rooms are the best. Definitely coming back!! Well done Merusaka!"
"I had mixed feelings before I have checked in. However had one of the finest experience there. The staffs are kinder and resort was awesome. Had the beach side dinner and the restaurant staffs are very kind.
In room services never failed to surprise.
Love to came back to Bali and MERUSAKA again."
"Location of the hotel is amazing. Waterblow beach, mall and shopping areas are just at a walking distance. Good variety was offered for the breakfast. Just loved staying here."
"Great hotel in Nusa Dua, Bali. Im booking two bedroom villa with private pool in this hotel for 2 nights, very satisfactory. Excellent cleanliness, staff are very helpfull & friendly. Food for breakfast n room service are amazing. Great location at Nusa Dua ITDC area, very near to beach. Very suitable for staycation with family. Children are very comfortable."
"The price of the rooms + everything on the menu at the pool bar and restaurants were very reasonable.  The rooms were very well designed, we were in the pool access room, the bath was great and you you share the pool with only 4 other rooms, very handy. The staff were lovely, almost too accommodating .
Would recommend!"
"Staff were very friendly and welcoming, grounds are beautifully kept with many pools to chose from. Villa was very clean and spacious with a big private pool and access to huge lagoon pool. Beach is very clean! Overall one of the nicest places we stayed in Bali and would stay again!"
"The staff were absolutely amazing 🤩 
Never been to a resort where all the staff actually want you to be there and want you yo come back. They are all so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. We will be highly recommending this resort especially because of the staff, we would go to breakfast and on the second day they all knew who we were and even what coffee we had each day. Then dinner they would know what cocktails or wine we liked. They made us feel part of their family and got to know them all personally.  Soo much appreciated for our first time visit to    Bali and we will be back very soon ❤️❤️"
"Very nice Indonesian restaurants. Good morning buffet, excellent room services. Airconditioning was stable although you would not feel like you're in Antartica. The beach was beautiful and super accesible. All facilities appear to be well maintained as there are staff all around but not intrusive manner. Stayed at Suite with 2 rooms and facilities were very good as everything appears to be in order."
"Best property in terms spacious rooms, awesome location infront of best blue water clean beach , swimming pool is a main attraction, also the guests staying at this property is of very good standard
Overall one should stay atleast 2 to 3 days"
"Staying here for 3 days during Nyepi, was such a wonderful experience. The resort was so huge, with a complete facility. I love the pool and the view, especially from Gading restaurant. The staff all are so humble, the food is good, and the room is super clean. I will definitely be back to this place soon."
"Booked for deluxe pool access with the large bed, but when we arrived the receptionist told us that the large bed was full, then upgraded us to suite room.
Overall the suite room was clean, they provided sajadah. The pool was huge, and the beach was clean, my children love to play at the beach, a lovely resort"
"My husband and l stayed for 3days in Nov 22 and we would highly recommend this accommodation. We stayed in a villa which was absolutely amazing. There were 4 restaurant with different menus , about 5pool areas and the beach was right in front of the resort."
"The staff at this hotel were amazing and so kind and helpful. They went out of their way to make sure I was ok and help with anything I needed. The room was also big, clean and spacious. With lots of attention to detail in everything."
"Overall, the resort was awesome. Love the resort. Very wide variety choices for breakfast. There are four restaurants in the resort itself. Can consider this hotel if you are travelling with kids and would love to enjoy private beach with other hotel facilities. Looking forward for our next stay"
So glad we chose to stay here. After being disappointed with other beaches and accommodation on the island we decided to book here. The staff were absolutely amazing and bent over backwards to help out anyway they could. Novi in the restaurant is an absolute gentleman and helped with our dietary requirements and made the usually stressful situation absolutely stress free! The beach is kept immaculately clean and is private to guests. The pools are abundant and their is also a kids club. We loved it so much we have booked another week here to complete our Bali holiday in style 😊 Rooms are well kept and spacious.
"It was a perfect stay.
I stayed at the inaya putri bali one bedroom pool villa with a recommendation from Agoda.com. 
I loved the private pool and the lagoon pool for the villa guests.
And it's very reasonable price.
I arrived a little earlier than check-in time, but Butler immediately escorted me to the villa and checked in inside the villa.
Although the villa's bedroom was a little bit small size, there were very fond of the well-equipped private pool.
In check-in time, the villa guest benefit was informed of free minibar, afternoon tea and cocktail time.
 Welcome gifts included eye patch and massage supplies, and cookies and nuts. they were delicious. Especially, it was Butler team who gave me great satisfaction in this stay. 
All butlers, including supervisor Angga, were very friendly and kind. 
And they responded immediately to my requests. 
Many butlers such as supervisors Angga, Butler Oka, Andi and Sicily have made my stay more happier. 
I sincerely want to thank them."
"Location, location, location, the open white sandy beach, great view and facilities. went here during covid with big discount, the health protocol was great, get into the room with sanitized sealed. Staff was great, but the breakfast was not a 5 star level hotel, probably during covid they reduce the menus and staffs (but hey we got a big discount price). Great place for family with childrens, book 2 deluxe rooms with access pool and we get the pool for ourself (I supposed each clustered pool made for 4 rooms access) the kids definitely happy. Will back here to stay in Nusa Dua."
"Have a good time staying here, can't get enough with the view, nice swimming pools, delicious breakfast"
"had a good stay, everything was great, but the gym is pretty minimal. Got a decent rate, so not bad."
"I love this place so much! The pools, the food, the people, the room- all were amazing! We stayed in the deluxe pool access room, and our private pool was such a treat. The two restaurants we went to were very understanding of allergies and we had some great meals.
Definitely stay here if you can!"
Absolutely perfect for what we needed. Great hotel on the beach and a boat ride away from great surf.
"Probably the best hotel I had ever been.
Can't express in words for the beauty of the place, the expansive landscapes, multiple swimming pools, private beaches and many to look forward to.
Would highly recommend any one planning there"
"It's a nice property, with the grandeur of any 5-star you expect, clean and tidy fresh rooms,
can improve in service quality especially during breakfast time, over all it was a good experience.."
"We had a problem with the air conditioning in our villa on the first night. The problem was handled quickly and efficiently. Ever request we had during our stay was handled in this manner.
Our villa was perfect for us. Quiet and the private pool temperature was just right. Would highly recommend this Hotel."
"Kolam renangnya oke bgt 
Area pantai enak untuk main pasir anak2 .. 
kamar menghadap kolam asri bgt .. 
will be back again .."
The device there is very good!
Really enjoy stay here...private beach access..very nice pool..big and clean room..tasty breakfast..the hotel staff also very helpful..will be stay here again next time
Location near all the popular resorts. Room is very clean and spacy. Highly recommended.
"Fabulous location, lovely swimming beach, amazing breakfast.
We stayed in a pool access room, small deck but it met our needs, large rooms. Good for families or couples or groups of friends. Quiet at night which also suited us. Walking distance to restaurants, shops and supermarket. Highly recommend."
The stay was amazing. The staffs were really nice and kind. They were very respectful and helpful as well. They made sure that we were comfortable and provided everything that we needed. The food were delicious despite having limited choices for lunch and dinner. They provided a variety of dishes in morning breakfast though. The facilities were easily accessible and the cleanliness of the beach and the whole place was exceptional. Overall had a very relaxing stay.
"Hotel has nice beach and 6 pools, included 2 child pool and a tower jump pool. 
Room is big but have no bed lamp, so a bit gloomy. 
We booked 2 rooms, AC in 1 room not too cool, but it is ok since we can open the connecting door. 
Bathroom is big as 1/3 of room and clean with big bathtub, but amenities can be improved as a 5 stars hotel
Breakfast is average and nothing special. 
Staff service is good. 
Overall is ok but can be better."
"Inaya putri bali is very recommended hotel to stay!!!!!!! Furthermore, the hotel is so very friendly for kids. All the things provided by hotel is very clean and amazing,  very friendly staff. I Still cannot move on from this hotel. Im sure to be back here to stay with my family. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INAYA!"
Superb area and close to everything. Beach is very good. Very friendly hotel. Staff was great. We stayed in private pool room.
This hotel has private beach and many swimming pool. Very clean beach.
The room was big and clean although the shower was not running well. The pool was awesome. The view to the beach was beautiful.

"Great pools, good food and outstanding service throughout, it's worth it."
"This wasn't our first time at Merusaka, and it won't be the last! The pool suite lagoons are wonder for children and plunging, as well as exquisite staff service for breakfast and other activities. Everyone is very considerate and attentive to detail - wonderful!"
"The Hotel located in great location, the Room is very nice, tidy and also clean. The price is very cheap between the other 5star hotel in Nusa Dua Centre. The Food at the breafast sometimes a little bit “Plain”, but if you eat the other time, except breakfast, the Food has great flavour. 
The Pros :
- Very Great Price for 5 star hotel at Nusa Dua.
The Cons :
- Not all the staff do the Health Protocol compliantly."
"We order 2 bedroom suite, it was great room with great facilities. They give best service to us, all staff are very friendly. Overall we really enjoy out stay at Merusaka,  my boy is super excited for the private pool outside our balcony. The minus is only the odor at the toilet at our room (4111), a little bit annoying for us."
"Very clean, friendly staff, great restaurants to eat the location on the clean beach and the pools where amazing ."
"The grounds are beautiful and so we’ll kept. The food, staff, rooms, pool and beach front were perfect. I miss it already!!"
"Fab beach, so clean and perfect for swimming as well as in the pools. Rooms were great and the food excellent. We only stayed 2 nights but wish we could have stayed longer . Not sure how easy it is to get out to see the area around it or the shops, but it’s only 30 mins to airport so very convenient ."
"We really enjoyed our stay. Definitely will stay there again. The staff are very friendly. Plenty of restaurants that stay open till late. We would have our delicious Rosella ice tea late by the sea. 
Would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to enjoy a holiday. Very affordable price."
Pleasant staff. Beautiful beach. Very fantastic facilities and not to forget great foods
the room is good. the bed is so big it can fit 3-4 person. the pool is huge and clean but there's lot of insects near the pool
very good. Hope to comeback soon
Hotel is in good location. The facilities is very good complete with private beach. The room was excellent. Breakfast was good. Only the front office staff should more welcoming the guest with smiles eventhough it is quite late for check in.
"Large but very nice spacious hotel, with large rooms. We had a private pool, which I would not bother with if returning, as their communal pools are lovely and the beach is beautiful. Recommended."
The beach straight out the front is really lovely.  The pools are AWESOME and the whole vibe is super relaxing. The staff go above and beyond to cater to your needs and the buffet breakfast is the best and biggest I've ever seen. The restaurants on site ate lovely with HOMAYA being a stand out. The spa centre is sensational. We stayed in the least expensive room and it was huge. It had a separate bathroom with an egg shaped bath and there was an L shaped sofa looking over the balvony. I would highly reccomend Inaya for a romantic getaway.
"This resort just has everything, will be back for a third time!!"
"After renovated, Merusaka Hotel which was Innaya Bali Hotel is a beautiful hotel, modern looks, cool and spacious room, facilities are amazing, pool direct to the beach is a beautiful view, very nice place to stay,"

Really good service + amazingly well kept hotel area and greatly maintained rooms. Perfect stay in a cozy quiet area in Bali in Nusa Dua.

Great stay for mindfulness even for solo travel.  
Very satisfied and happy with our stay . Would definitely return ."

Experience was amazing at Merusaka. Staff was very friendly. Great location at Nusa Dua

But food taste so so.
Been several times stayed here, perhaps could improve for food.

"We stayed the whole family in Inaya Putri from 05/02-13/02. We were surprised how great hotel, great organization of the hotel, and absolutely fantastic stuff. The person who is leading, managing this hotel, we have high respect to. 
Every morning they greeted us with specialty made sushi for our baby, even with no asking. We would like to acknowledge Mahendra, who took care of us so well while we were eating.
From all our heart we say thank you that you made our holiday so special."
"Stay here for 5 days and it was incredible place @merusaka, we booked villas with two bedroom,  private pool its so nice, and we have our door to the biggest pool side the villas, recommend this place for traveling with fam and children, but for breakfast not quite good enough be ready..haha"

Resort provides exclusive private pool along with best food and services.
"things are great, enjoyed our stay.
But I'd be more happy if there are more lights in the room especially near the wardrobe. Too dark to my preference"
"Just beautiful! From the lovely, accommodating staff to the morning buffet and restaurants there is not much I could fault about my stay! I was stay solo while joining some friends at Inaya. Every effort was put into having a room close by to there’s! If there was a problem staff were there to help in minutes! 100% recommend staying and will be back again that’s for sure!"
"Good breakfast spread, very clean swimming pool, good facilities and very clean premise,however sea is not  very clean this time of the year, due  to sea weed on the water and breech."

All other restaurants were excellent."

We especially liked and enjoyed our interaction with Arta, the duty evening manager - what a lovely guy"
The hotel has private beach and has great swimming pool. Our children enjoy the clean beach ver much.
Recommended for you who wants warm vacation
"For its value its a nice resort with nice view and beach. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. The entire resort has huge area so going from one point to another might take time but the wonderful view makes up for it. The deluxe pool access is worth booking. Even though we have seen bad reviews about the breakfast, it was actually good considering that there are not much people coz of Pandemic. Overall, great stay.👍"
"We had fantastic time stayed in this hotel for 3 days. Inaya Putri has all facilities that you need without going out from the property. The pools are amazing, nice beach, great room (we booked deluxe access pool which is really recommended for family), and good foods. Thank you Inaya Putri."
Very friendly staff.Superb infinity pools overlooking the beach . Nice amenities.Tasty buffet breakfast.Exceeded my expectations.Will definitely come back here again
"Definitely will come again to merusaka. Nice facilities, private beach, nice staff too. I really enjoy as long as i stayed in there."
"The room is spacious for family with 2 children. It offer 2 bed which if combine bigger than king size bed !!!
Beach is the best and not too crowded. Plenty of pool to swim. Perhaps the only drawback are the rented bike which are not in the best condition with max 1 hr rent. 
Overall it was enjoyable stay and will come back."
"Everything  in Merusaka made our holiday memorable  . The sun rise never to be missed ✨️ 
Calm & relaxed 😌 😎 holiday"

Nice hotel stay with family with perfect beach
"I am very happy to stay at this hotel.. the rooms are maintained and clean, the atmosphere is quiet, the location is good and there is a private beach"
Though staying during pandemic season and some facility not servicing still we can have good enough experience and essential function facility still operate even with such low Guest attendance. Good effort that get our respect.
