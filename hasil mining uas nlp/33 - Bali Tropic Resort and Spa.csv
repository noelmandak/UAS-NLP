"I was staying at different 5 star hotel in Nusa dua and was having the worst experience there with poor food and the chemicals they used to clean burnt my skin so i booked to move to Bali Tropical resort and spa and it has been the absolute best experience i’ve had! The hotel is perfect, beautiful and so clean with fruit trees growing outside my room the staff could not be more sincere and friendly the food is also great quality and range for Bali. I booked a 4h spa treatment that has been the highlight of my week you can’t get any better then what i experienced scrubbed with coconut then drenched in milk and honey while getting massaged and pampered for a price that should be 4x more then what they charge a huge thank you to the staff for making my holiday relaxing and enjoyable. T from Syd Aus."
"Excellent hotel, Good location, Beach side and excellent breakfast. Staffs are very helpful and polite. Even we had an early flight for departure, they had packed Food packet for us."
"Overall nice resort, nice people, very clean and loved our stay at the resort! Could have bit more indian/veg options or may be as per the availability of the indian guests can modify the breakfast menu and also overall in both restaurants not a single Indian vegetarian dish was available hence we had to go out for lunch and dinner!"
"Great Hotel with Traditional Balinese exterior. Room is spacious and clean. Separate bathtub, shower and toilet. Private beach at the backyard, an instructor is there every morning for exercise in the swimming pool, decent gym. Various of family game (volleyball, mini soccer, chess, etc). Food is delicious, great for family & vegan guest. They also provide ""all day inclusive"" dining & entertainment to make sure we are fully occupied all day long without even getting out from the hotel. Simply relaxing and chilling."
"mr wayan kajang was the best customer relationship staff at the hotel. he is so nice and eager to share about local culture with us. 
overall the hotel was brilliant in all aspects.
would definitely come back next time"
"Loved the traditional Balinese vibes at the hotel. Its a beautiful resort with direct access to the beach. Rooms are extremely spacious and beautifully done in traditional way. Good food and services. 
It has decent activities for the kids too."
"Very accommodating staffs, super clean place. Best place to have your vacation. Very good local foods. Near to malls and other places. The value for money is great too."
"The hotel has one of the best values for its costs. Facilities are not shinny contemporary as other resorts in the area, but they are really great. With Bali Tropic you don't pay the premium extra price of other resorts with contemporary facilities, so it is a great value for the price. 
The internet has issues in various areas of the resort, and the signal is awful in some rooms. However, each door is a piece or art, and there is a huge and beautiful temple inside of the resort; I don't think most resorts in the region have something like this. 
Since the moment you arrive, the staff is incredibly helpful, friendly and respectful; they are always smiling and ready to take care of everything you need. This is one of the best staffs I've experienced in the world.
The Nusa Dua area where the resort is located is extremely secure and has great restaurants, beautiful beaches and great bars at walking distance. You are not in the middle of a crowded city, but you have the feeling of a quiet small town with really nice people."
"Had a great time. Older style resort (which I prefer),  lovelly very clean and large rooms
Staff were fantastic, food was ok. They did not have all restyrants open due to the limited people staying at resort...
Free breakfast was very good.
Highly recommend if you want to chill on the beach..."
"This is a great resort to stay! Staff were courteous and helpful, the room was spacious and clean. Love the balinese traditional design and touches of the room. Food was delicious and affordable."
"Our stay at Bali Tropic was amazing. Friendly service and helpful staff all round. Good location and many places  to eat out of the resort if you prefer to. 
Rooms were large and comfortable. Would definitely be back. Few minutes to beach and not crowded"
Where should I start?  The gracious staff greeting us with cold welcoming drinks…the beautiful grounds…spacious and beautifully appointed rooms..delicious meals…so many wonderful experiences…I know we will be back!!
"Location close to Toll if need to get to Kuta/Seminyak area. We got upgraded to a Deluxe Bungalow Room which was awesome, room was big and clean. We used the pool a lot and they have excersise every morning. The massages were very nice. Only downside was we arrived after a storm so the beach wasn't clean as the pics, no room services for ordering food. Other than that it was a pleasant stay. Also Jet ski near by was 225k rp for 30min was fun."
"If you’re looking for a relaxed atmosphere in a tropical paradise. This is the place to stay, wonderful staff and the food is amazing. Great location"
Their customer service couldn't be faulted. we stayed at a slightly more expensive place after this and enjoyed our stay here better.  Amazingly friendly and accommodating to any request. I couldn't recommend it enough. and lovely authentic architecture .
"Well. There are a lot of best hotels especially the expensive one. Bali Tropic is the other way.
They are giving a good price for good quality environment. Private beach just for 5 of us with clean and good view. Swimming pool also just for 5 of us. Really like a stay in a private villa in Nusa Dua.
My children really enjoy our stay so I have to extend the duration. Really good hotel with reasonable price."
when we arrived we were upgraded to a bungalow which was lovely and right beside all amenities. The pool was great and breakfast had lots of choices would definitely stay again
And please up your facility a little bit due to aging.  Othewise this hotel is a gem.  Thank you !
"Lucky for me, they upgrade my room to number 2 (from top) class. 
It was a GREAT time to spend in the hotel. They have pool and direct sight to sunrise view.
Location is near to Tanjung Benoa (recreation place). There is medicine store 24hrs nearby (Kimia Farma)."
"very close to Nusa dua convention center, choose this hotel for very good deals. Big rooms and excellent facilities. Good for either business or leisure."
"What a wonderful place to relax and unwind, the breakfast each morning was amazing with so much to choose from. What made our trip special was a the welcoming staff. We both highly recommend this Resort to any travelers of any age as they have something for everyone."
"Wonderful place to stay for a holiday, the breakfast was sensational with a huge selection. The staff made our stay so much better."
"This is the 2nd time I have stayed in past few months. The staff are wounderful and caring, the new food menu is fantstic, the rooms are always spotless and the beautiful gardens are always maintaine to the highest level.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
"I love it here! Everything was great! People here are nice and very helpful...
Will come back again!
Thanks for everything!"
The people at Bali tropic go out of their way to make you feel at home! So don't think twice about booking! The traditional Balinese architecture is icing on the cake!
"Good service from staff, room clean. Nice Breakfast and varie.
but the wifi... need to improve 
over all we are happy stay at this hotel"
"- Excellent staff and service with traditional Balinese vibe in the property. Great New Year Party with a terrific bar.
- Bad food, terrible wi-fi and guests smoking all over the place.
- If you are a smoker and looking to switch off from wi-fi, this might be the place. There are plenty of restaurants right outside and near to the property."
"Best side of Bali, near by many Indian restaurants (Indian Delhi restaurant)
Overall nice place to stay"
Fascinating experience living in the resort! Feeling reluctant to leave. Ended up staying most of the time in the resort enjoying the spa and private beach.
"If i could rate the staffs 10/5, I would do. They are really nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend to friends."
Very nice and clean place. Quiet at night. Breakfast is top notch.
"It's really very nice with including pool with bar, beach view,spa,what not every thing in resort."
"Will definitely return here. Everything good here from pickup at airport to our stay. Lovely staff and excellent service. 
Beach is few minutes walk and not crowded. 
Nothing negative to report."
"Staff are nice, rooms are big, love the bathroom, over all its a nice hotel"
"Beautiful boutique hotel that is perfect if you want to have a true Bali feel to where you are staying compared to so many other hotels that all look the same. The staff is amazing and so welcoming, everything was spotless and the rooms beautiful. Great pool , lots of activities and just a great feeling staying there. We would recommend to anyone wanting more of a cultural feel to where they were staying. Highly recommend! Can’t wait to come back."
"We love the Bali Tropic and have stayed there 9 times. I like that it is nice and quiet, on the beach and that the staff are simply wonderful. Last time I was there the Hotel had started updating the bungalows with new fixtures and fittings."
"We would recommend this hotel to anyone.  The staff were so friendly, efficient and amazing.  The breakfasts were fantastic and the location an absolute dream.  The resort is authentic Balinese and so peaceful, green and beautiful."
Beautiful tropical paradise getaway! Everything I dreamt of.
Everything you need--love the little sitting area on the porch.
Surprisingly our room was big and the food was great. Their staffs were also very friendly. Highly recommended
"Excellent friendly staff, so helpful in booking our ferry ride that went side ways when we tried online.  The traditional dinner night was very delicious and the breakfasts were top notch. All at a very good price point."
"Amazing location, friendly and professional staff"
"Great environment, grass and temple, nice restaurants"
Very spacious room and love the pool area
Will always go to this place!!
"The Balinese bungalow is very classic, however there is no lift landing in upper floor. Definitely needs porter to carry your luggage. You need to climb stairs to lobby and eventually we found way out to car park without climbing stairs but limit time of opening. Good handling of breakfast especially for fruit , 🥐 pastry etc . Large dinning area, but swimming pool is a bit congested. Many older smokers don’t care about non smoking area.  We supposedly to have early check in for two hours but nothing offered!"
Nice huge pool with multiple restaurants and extremely friendly staff. It’s also great to have a private beach that doesn’t get extremely busy in the off-season.
A great resort friendly staff nice and quiet
"The resort exceeded our expectations, it is so well maintained and the staff incredibly nice.  We relaxed by the pool, swam in the sea, paddle boarded - all in all great time!"
"We booked two rooms (twin share) for our team supporting the B20 Indonesia presidency and we were pleasantly surprised. 
We always read the negative reviews first when choosing a place and we were pleasantly surprised at good sized, clean and comfortable rooms. The hotel is on the beach but to be honest, there are nicer spots of beach if you walk north for about five minutes on the beach. The pool is large and great for kids and adults. The team gave breakfast a big thumbs up but the few meals they ordered for room service were sub par. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable although my team had to find their own motorbikes (it turns out right across the street) which in Bali should be a no-brainer for any hotel staff to help out with. 
All in all a good experience for the price. Yes, the hotel is older but it is kept up well and I think for tourists there is a great Bali feel."
"The Bali Tropic Resort and Spa is a wonderful place to stay.  The buildings are tired but the staff do an excellent job of keeping them up.   The most important parts of our stay were excellent.   Great AC, great food, amazing Spa and massage, terrific shower, superb bed and mattress, beautiful pool, friendly and helpful staff and fantastic breakfast.   For the money, this was a wonderful choice for our week in Bali."
"Lokasinya bagus, pantainya bersih, pelayanannya juga ramah sekali..very good..."
Everything great
Bali Tropic has it all in a Balinese charming resort. Traditional carved doors and styling. Friendly service. Inclusive packages and all the waterspouts out the front on the quiet beach front . It's all here. Probably only half full so come to this side and enjoy.
"Just lingering around with children to the beach and swimming pool. very nice stay for 3 nights, will go back there again"
Everything was excellent. I highly recommend the hotel.
All is well
"Resort is totally good no issues on that but the breakfast was OK and it was western breakfast and not much options in buffet, very less options as per the price of the resort."
"although the weather was bad during our stay, but overall we enjoy it. From a wide selection of breakfast, a lovely in-house Pura (temple) nice beach front, fun swimming pool that my kids enjoy very much! not forgetting nice landscape and a clean traditional room with a nice bath tub too! totally value for money especially for Nusa Dua area and walking distance to supermarket and restaurants nearby!"
Loved our stay at Bali tropic- traditional resort with plenty of space and activities.The staff are all extremely friendly and welcoming.
"Nice hotel enjoyed our stay, reasonably helpful staff. Poor WiFi except the hitel reception area. Unfortunately this is something that most people need these days.
Was dissapointed to see that bars in hotel did not have lemon Bintang Radler as a selection. Which country does not support their own countries beers. $12 cocktails just don't cut it after a while in a warm humid country."
"Clean, friendly staff, pool and beach"
"Very nice room ,good swimmingpool
I disliked the food"
"Nice hotel with friendly staff . There are mosquito so even though you can sit on the chair facing the sea ( during sunset and after) you would run back to your room .place for basketball, chess , library, billiards etc"
"This resort is at a very good location, withnlot of restaurants, Sipermarket and Water Sports nearby at walking distance.
View from its private beach is good, it has recliner and kids play area with swing and small slide, that you wpuldnlive to use.
I saw some Guided sessions wete happenjng in Swimming pool. You can enjoy pool bar. 
Few concerns,
- I reached Hotel at 01:45 PM, but had to wait till 03:15 PM at reception for room to be allocated.
Honestly that was hot day, and we needed early room. As Agoda Gold Member we were entitled for 2 hour early check-in, though we got room 1: 30 Hiurs later than mentioned Check-in time.
Staff told they are preparing room.
Braakfast was Ok Ok. Liked Fried rice.
Few improvements needed in breakfast,
- For Omlette we have to queue up for 15-20 mins, as they denied to serve on table, even when long queue was there.
For water and Juice glass size was very small(100 ml), so you have to ho many times to a cabin like room to get water or juices. Unfortunately except for tea, waiter didn't serve anything on table.
- In room no torch was provided."
"Good value resort with friendly staff, unfortunately let down by allowing guests to smoke all over the place. If you're a non-smoker, who doesn't enjoy second hand smoke in your face at the breakfast table, the pool bar, the pool area, outside your room, etc., then it's probably not the resort for you."
A little old and tired but great location and value for money
"need to improve cleanliness in beach and garden area, and your facility is too old"
"I am so sorry to write a not good review, but I must. It is very obvious that the hotel was closed for long time and it lack of a proper maintenance. The rooms smell really stuffy and humid, we booked the Royal Room, is supposed is better than the Deluxe room, and is not true, Royal are really dark and make you feel like living in a closet, besides are much worst located within the hotel. The buffet is not what you can expect in a hotel with this prices, is like many other places this summer of 2022: after 2 years of COVID, the quality and the services are 1 or 2 categories below expected, but the prices still are high as previously. Not fair for the customer, lower quality at the same price. The staff is really great, very friendly, kind, nice and willing to do their best."
"1. Too many mosquitoes - due to stagnant water pool
2. Rooms have insufficient lighting
3.  Same breakfast menu on a daily basis
4. Nice pool and close proximity to the beach"
"I paid a big amount of money for my new year stay! Didn't expect this kind of dissapointment. First, they give me a deluxe instead of the bungalow that I booked for. This is where they cheated me! Second, the staff was not so welcoming. They really need to change their behaviour towards the guests coz people from around the world visit and the negative reviews gonna beat their business to the ground. All in all I wouldn't recommend this hotel to any couples or families. There are a lot of options in the area that are cheaper with a lot of amenities!"
"The resort was decent.  There are huge mosquitoes swarming this resort, i have so many big bites that i look like i have monkey pox. The dinners are ok but very expensive."
"Been in Bali and Lombok for past 2 weeks. Stayed in different hotels and definitely able to compare. Wanted to pamper myself with a good hotel and decided to go for this 5 stars hotel which cost 250USD, it is the most expensive hotel i stayed throughout my 14days. But it is among the worst among all!! Hotel is old and not well maintained. The beach is so dirty which is totally different from their picture. And worst!! The allow mosquito to bite their client. I was stung the whole night and when i called, the staff just replied she cant help but asked me to apply mosquito repellent. This is radiculous as we arw not paying to be bitten by insects. The next day while i was in the restaurant, all the client are talking about the same topic, insect bites! And some even bitten on their whole leg. Im sorry, this hotel is the worst and i will never forget."
Hotel is great and the rooms are amazing but the staff is absolutely deceiving with their patrons… do not ask them to help you with any travel plans :( extremely bad experience
"Check in should be in 2 pm, but we waited one hour, hotel old, beach not as on photos at all, shower was broke, I couldn't take propa shower,  kettle was not turn off himself. For 200$ per night (royal bungalow )
 I could get at least a good shower at any hotel ."
"Not worth staying at this place. It is very dated, stale and just feels dead."
The wifi doesn’t work. The phone is and thrashcan were dirty.
Service was very poor and food wasn’t that you are expecting from 5 star hotel.
"We found that the Bali Tropic Resort and Spa was the best resort we have stayed at in our many ventures to Bali and will be making it our place to stay when we visit Bali next. We found the staff friendly and helpful, the rooms and grounds were immaculate. The resort catered for all water sports with offshore adventures departing right off the beach which saved the hassle of fighting with the Bali traffic. The food was great with a choice of smorgasbord or dining at the 24 hour restaurant, with traditional Bali dancing and shows that you can watch whilst enjoying dinner. From the resort you can walk along the beach front and dine at any of the five star resorts that are on the Nusa Dua beach front. All in all if you want to spend either I nice relaxed or action packed holiday you can get it all here and the choice of not having to leave the resort if you choose is a great option to have. You can walk or catch the free shuttle bus to the Bali Connection shopping centre in Nusa Dua where you can enjoy hassle free shopping. We strongly recommend this resort to any one visiting Bali"
"i have to say that nusa dua was my least favorite area that i visited in bali, but i absolutely loved bali tropic resort. it was not as hyped up and expensive as some of the surrounding hotels, like the nusa dua resort and club med. i liked that the buildings and rooms still had the authentic balinese style to them, as opposed to the very contemporary & modern styles of the other hotels. my boyfriend and i walked the beach boardwalk everyday and found it great for going to find another restaurant for dinner or just walking off to enjoy watching the moon rise from the beach. the pool area was lovely and they offered fun games like billiards and ping pong, which we took advantage of frequently. the breakfast buffet each morning was delicious and all of our meals at the cempaka restaurant were great. there's also a lot of options for water sports right at the resort, which is super convenient. we could easily walk across the street to the convenient stores if we were ever in need of something, or just to stock up our room's fridge with bintangs and water."
"The Bali Tropic Restort and spa is a beautiful hotel, likely one of the two or three nicest in the area.  The Nusa Dua peninsula can feel a little artificial in places -- because it is artificial, I suppose -- but the Bali Tropic overcomes this with its lush landscaping and tasteful balinese architecture.  The rooms are nice and have all the amenities you would expect, and the breakfast is massive.  Overall, it's a great value for the very reasonable rates it charges.

The Bali Tropic is not perfect, however.  It's rooms lack internet access, which in this day and age and at this class of hotel is increasingly unacceptable.  The lobby does have wifi, but the grounds are large enough that tromping over there from your room late at night is annoying.  Also, the front desk staff gave us some bad information on a couple occasions, including once when they told us there was a car rental place just a few minutes walk up the street.  In reality, the car rental place had been closed (and torn down) months before, and we wasted a good hour before giving up and hiring a driver for the day."
"If you are looking for an ultra-hip and happening hotel, then this isn't for you. Some reviews said that this hotel is outdated and old. It is, but that's what is great about it! We chose Bali Tropics because unlike the other 4 or 5-star hotels, it boasted traditional Balinese architecture, which made our stay in Bali extra special. We really wanted to stay in a hotel that was some distance away from the Nusa Dua ""happening"" strip (where all the 5-star hotels were) because we wanted a more quiet and relaxing stay. The hotel beach area was really quiet and a good place to relax.  Their beach faces east so if you're the type who wants to watch the sunset from your hotel lounge chair, then don't pick this one either. Even if the hotel is away from the main beach, it was pretty easy to get around. To explore the whole beach strip, we rented bikes from the hotel for a cheap price. Lastly, what makes this a great hotel is the staff. They were accommodating and really nice. We even got an upgrade (no additional charge!) because the room we had originally requested was not available at the time we checked in. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Bali Tropics. :)"
"Here's the thing about Bali: you don't really have to pay five star prices to enjoy five star hotels and services. Bali Tropic Resort and Spa is quite a good example of a very convenient, very beautifully laid hotel at accessible prices. You won't find the kind of luxurious extravagance you might find if you are willing to pay a lot more, but you will certainly find Bali: a small but beautiful stretch of beach, small altars and temples spread all over the property and a deeply encroached sense of tradition and spirituality. Amenities? A beautifully tended garden, a Balinese stage, a nice enough swimming pool, a supermarket just across the street and the Bali Collection Mall a short car ride away. Space for improvement? Probably breakfast could be slightly more Balinese. All said, a good choice for medium income travelers."
"wow ! was the exclamation from both my sons as we entered the beautiful spacious balinese style deluxe bungalow . we had a wonderful holiday at bali tropic  resort n spa !
the all inclusive was great . all meals were appetizing with both local n western spread. 
we were very well served even when we had our super pass 1 am . the staff were very accommodating. the food was beautifully  presented and delicious . 
the location of the hotel is so convenient , with the sea sports  just a few steps away fm our  hotel rooms . 
my boys really enjoyed all the sea sports . they tried everything  that was available , and they were just awesome !
even i had my share of screaming and adrenaline rush.... at my age ! 
we were reluctant to leave after our 5 days stay .... 
our flight was 10 pm but we needed to check out by 12 pm as usual . 
but we were pleasantly surprised when the front desk personnel were so accommodating n generous . we were given coupons for lunch n coupons for pool towels , on top of that they offered us a room to shower after our last tour around bali just before our flight . 
that was amazing ! 
i felt so grateful n indeed it was so refreshing and complete comfort to be able to have a nice shower just before our flight . 
our stay at the bali resort were unforgettable ! 
unforgettable because it was such a great vacation .
and unforgettable because we had so many mosquitos n sand fly bites . 
that is the only sack back . 
so my advise is arm yourself with a can of  ""off"" whenever you go dinning 
than you will have a peaceful meal. 
i will be back !"
"I chose Bali tropic for our family stop over in Nusa dua after reading reviews on Agoda . We were satisfied with everything! We spent just 3 days there but we loved it! Kids loved the swimming pool and breakfasts. Surrounding hotels are more luxurious, but Bali tropic is definitely a great value for money as it was built in a Balinese style. The beach is good enough, but we also liked neighbouring beaches of the more expensive hotels (just 5-10 minutes to the right from the beach). I will definitely recommend Bali Tropic to all! It is beautiful"
"we stayed for 2 nights at bali tropic resort. we had the deluxe room. the room is big and we like the big restroom especially. the location is just right at the start of nusa dua. however there are not much choice of dining places outside the resort. have to take cab to the further north of nusa dua where more resturants are located. if not, there is also resturants inside the resport. overall, nice and relaxing trip!"
"The Bali Tropic Resort and Spa was fantastic.  I was extremely happy there.  I have no bad things to say.  I honestly wish I could have stayed longer.  Everywhere I turned there was Balinese touched beauty.  For example, just outside of my room's back porch was a channel of water, running the extent of the building, filled by Balinese statues covered in moss.  The ""moat"" was patrolled by beautiful fish.  The attention to detail was obvious and spectacular!  The room was beautiful.  They even had fresh local tropical fruit on the desk.  If I hadn't already made plans to see the local sights I probably would have never left the hotel.  Everything my fiance and I needed was right there.
Would I recommend this hotel to others?  Without a doubt, I emphatically say yes!"
"we like the beautiful balinese architecture, friendly service and the relaxing, peaceful ambiance but what impress us the most is the room itself. we had for ourselves a deluxe room which is the cheapest room available but even this is a sight to behold! from the elaborate carving on room entrance to the huge and comfortable bed to the spacious bathroom which has separated bathtub, shower and toilet... we are so impressed!

situated in nusa dua, i would say the quieter side of bali, our hotel is about 30 minutes from the bustling kuta. depending on the kind of holiday you are looking for, this is a little far from where all the actions are but in exchange you have for yourself quiet, relaxing moments in the hotel and on the beach. we would recommend bali tropic to our friends."
"there isnt much to fault with the the bali tropical, lovely rooms with great bathrooms & balconies, very freindly staff, nice location in nusa dua, great pool & beach!.
we stopped at a very reasonable rate & were very happy with the quality of the resort.the rooms are exceptionally clean & well maintained. 
you can go for some nice walks all the way along the nusa dua peninsula and get a great view of the other hotels in the area.
only down side to the hotel was the free wifi was only available in the lobby/bar, which isnt a major problem, but would be nice to have in the rooms."
"I was attending a conference at nearby Conrad Hotel but due to unavailability of rooms, decided to stay at Bali Tropic. I did not regret the choice at all. According to one of the staff, Bali Tropic is owned by a Balinese so what you get is a true Balinese stay at the hotel. Despite being there for business, I felt very relax and uplifted everytime I walked the lovely grounds. The room was so lovely with intricately carved wooden door and Balinese accented furnishings. the ensuite was separated by a sliding window and roomy. water pressure was strong with plenty of hot water. the pool was ok sized with sunken bar. I tried the aromatheraphy massage and it was oh so good only bad point was that the room i was in was next to the restaurant so i could hear voices and clinking of plates and utensils during the massage which was a bit annoying. if you'd like to try out the massage, request for a room that is farthest from the restaurant. i did not try the all inclusive so cant comment much on the food. i did have breakfast there every morning n the breakfast spread was quite good. my only complaint would be that there is no internet in the rooms and that to use the wifi or internet you'd have to go to the lobby. if you are in bali for a relaxing and romantic holiday then i would not hesitate to recommend Bali Tropic but if you are there for business and would need to use the internet often then perhaps another business friendly hotel would suit you better."
"We arrived at Bali Tropic and were greeted with a cocktail and friendly staff. We asked if we could have a ground floor room which was given to us without a worry. The beach area was lovely with a lot on offer, such as, giant chess games to play, with numerous ball games, also billiard tables for all to play. The gardens were magnificent and pool with swim up bar was a welcome oasis in the heat of the day. The Location was great for tourist trips to Uluwatu, Jimboran Bay and access to watersports of Nusa Dua/Benoa. Although we didn,t use the ""All Inclusive"" Feature at this hotel, we would consider definately using it next time. Just down the road,was a restaurant strip where we found ""BumBu Bali"" true balinese food. It is also a cooking school if you want to arrange a class."
"I arranged a Bali Trip with my girl friends from New York and Manila through Agoda. They were all impressed with the hotel I chose...specially, with the price and location of the hotel. We enjoyed Bali from the moment we arrived at the hotel. The Beach was perfect! It is combed and cleaned every morning. The beach water was cool, refreshing against the Hot Bali Sun. All in all, our stay at the Bali Tropic Resort and Spa gave us a GREAT and MEMORABLE  ""girl-bonding"" time!"
"Our stay at Bali Tropic Resort and Spa can be summarized into one word. RELAXING. My bestfriends and I had so much fun just lounging on the beach chair while worshipping the sun. While the sand and the beach are not as beautiful as Boracay, i can say that the beach in Bali is still awesome. The food especially their buffet breakfast is superb! Their rooms are spacious enough and the bed was comfortable. The staff were very friendly and they speak English well. They were also accommodating. We will definitely come back here!"
"we didn't stay long at this hotel as we were traveling about on our honeymoon but we did get upgraded and we have never stayed here before.  that was a plus! love the balinese feel of the rooms and landscaping, we have stayed at a lot of hotels in nusa dua and for the price, cleanliness, and friendliness of the staff we would recommend bali tropic over all the rest."
"just got back and our 4 days were great!
We like to enjoy local atmosphere when in holiday and Bali tropic resort was just awesome.
Quite, layback and amazing location on Nusa dua beach.
Restaurant is a bit simple and buffet nothing special but still ok. Anyway you can go out for lunch and dinners as there is much choice."
"We were all so very happy to stay in late December and remove ourselves from our busy routine and enjoy a time of total relaxation. My expectations of Bali was not great, particularly after a previous short trip which involved a 3 hour visit to ""Seedy Kuta"". To my surprise, the Bali Tropic Resort and Spa has completely changed my view of Bali and the staff epitomise the gentle caring nature of Balinese people. A huge thank you for your hospitality and undoubtedly we will be back!"
"It's the staff that make this special. Probably on the best beach in nusa dua. Whilst there are many 5 star hotels nearby and much newer, the beach is wonderful, very safe for children. The rooms are really clean . It' only a 10 minute walk to the Bali connection with so man y shops and restaurants. Immediately across from the hotel you have a very good supermarket and several spas. My only issue is that some  of the rooms lack privacy and are very near the road. We stayed in  a bungalow no 2030  good location and quiet. Would I stay here again Yes, we had a wonderful time."
"I and my wife looked forward to come back to Bali. We spent our honeymoon at Bali Tropic Resort & Spa in 2008.
What a wonderful time we had! The Bali wedding ceremony was something we have been remembering for our lifetime. 
This time we brought with us our two friends to celebrate the 5th anniversary and have fun. 
Bali Tropic is an excellent example of the hotel that makes you feel comfortable from the the first seconds of your stay. Garden view bungalows feature elements of Balinese architecture with wooden doors carved by local masters; there is the beautiful hindu temple surrounded by a fountain and a small golf course. The hotel has its own beach with the sports center, tennis tales and billiard."
Great old school bones to this property. Proportions are great. Big rooms. Staff are lovely. Dining areas and beach furniture need desperate upgrading. Very old fashion. Could modernise. Great value for money.
"Lovely teak rooms, gracious balconies, pretty gardens, a real old-style gem"
"We stayed here for 7 days.  Staff were wonderful, our room was lovely and clean.  Breakfast was good with lots of choices.  Will definitely stay here again."
Very nice hotel a little old some mosquitoes but overall very much Worth to stay. The facilities are nice and clean the stuff is very friendly and helpful I would definitely stay there again
"Not the room from the photo, but 1st floor, dirty sea water"
"This was our 2nd visit and lived up to the 1st which was pre- the c word! 
The staff make this place. So pleasant and friendly and will do what they can to make your stay enjoyable.
Its not 5 star so if you are looking for  modern pristine white bathrooms and shiny tap ware this isn't.  But, I am super fussy and hate any sign of things not being clean and we have returned so for me that's a win. Cannot recommend highly enough. Super chilled and relaxed. Well worth doing the all-inclusive but reasonable enough that if you wanted to hsve z change of"
Place is worth every Penny
"Nice, but some rooms are dated and need some refurbishment.... Food is good, breakfast spread is excellent."
"This resort had it all, friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were cleaned daily and felt clean. We stayed in a bungalow with king bed, room had plenty of space to move around, bathroom room area was large as well. Only downside was that the fridge is too small, but it’s manageable. You also get two small bottles of water complimentary each day. 
Breakfast smorgasbord had it all and was fresh and delicious. Had two restaurants onsite. 
The pool was large with swim a bar and a great place to just relax and unwind. The resort has a peaceful setting and also has a beachfront with plenty of water activities to choose from. 
At night you can walk along the beach boardwalk and visit the other resorts to drink and eat if you so desire. 
There is a few shops across from the resort where you can buy water, nibbles and other items. There are many restaurants close by if you wish to eat out and also amazing massage facilities at really reasonable prices. 
A couple of markets located in either direction of the resort if you don’t want to go to Kuta or if you want something more western then you can go to Bali Collection, which has a range of modern clothing and accessories shops as well as restaurants."
"Only Chinese check room，not Europeans and Americans, doing this kind of thing affects the experience, bad reviews."
"We had an amazing time at the resort 
Great location, very friendly staff, delicious food .
Only the negative side is that We paid for 2 adults and 1 child (7 years old) but had 1 bed and towels and water were supplied for 2 only.Other than that everything was great"
They hide it everyday to the sand instead of throwing them away.  The ocean and the sand beach are full of them making it so bad.
It was nice! Definitely comfortable for relax. Recommended to borrow bikes and ride on the ocean side. If you are there in a Friday they have a nice show with buffet
Stayed with young children and Mil in 2 two rooms. Excellent customer service.  In a call they fix most of the issues if need to be . Morning breakfast was continental buffet with hot food options. There is traveller advisor for fixing tours at nominal price . Pool was very clean and good for kids though it was small . Kids play centre was v small and not so functional . But I would highly recommend with young kids as it was very safe and convenient.
"Bali tropical resort and spa is a beautiful traditional looking hotel, lots of balinese features surround the hotel inside and outside, the wooden carvings are stunningly beautiful, the gardens are lovely and food is good too. The hotel is right on a nice clean beach, there are motorised watersports you can hire like jetski, banana boat, doughnut ride etc. You can negotiate prices with them , Also bike hire is available which I recommend just to see the other hotels and beaches along the pathway. I would recommend you go all inclusive especially if you like to have a few beers and cocktails throughout your day as the drinks are expensive especially when they add on their taxes, a bintang beer was around $8 after tax add on and cocktail around $15 , happy hour is 2 for 1 at 5pm but you have to mention it to them as they don't let on . Breakfast was great you have choice of pancakes,waffles,pastries(about 5 different ones) eggs cooked any way , traditional balinese brekky, cooked brekky, cereals, fruit, yoghurts..quite a good selection. Pool is nice with swim up bar,  the rooms are huge , we stayed in the cheapest room garden view although ours had no view of a garden just buildings 😆 wasn't fussed as we didn't sit out on it much . king size four poster comfy bed and pillows, huge open  ensuite ! It was great !
as being a woman I had lots of toiletries etc, lots of room to get dressed! There is a great little lical cafe shack if you go out on the beach path and turn right walking past Sol melia hotel next door, you can get a balinese meal for $7 with a beer or soft drink and their banana fritters are amazing!  , It was mainly  europeans at the hotel, staff are lovely too. I will be going back here but all inclusive next time 😁"

Only the food is very much tailored to European tastes :)"
"We would absolutely recommend Bali Tropic. The staff were fantastic, very friendly. Our room was spacious and clean. 10/10 for a great family holiday."
