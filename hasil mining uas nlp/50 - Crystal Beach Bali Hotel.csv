Column 1
All the staff are a delight and look after your every need. You get what you pay for . I will always stay here again. The rooms are extra spacious and well presented.
"The place is very calming and relaxing, there are sun beds where you can spend hours chilling near the beach and appreciating the view in front of you. The staff is nice and helpful and can help you with Scooter rent, car rent,etc. Just that the location is a bit stranded and you will need 3-4 mins ride/15 mins walking to access the main road/market for buying anything. Otherwise an excellent stay!"
"please, save yourself the time and hassle of crowded canggu and seminyak and go to this lovely spot instead (its close to Denpasar!). Annie did so much to accommodate me during my stay! Breakfast was wonderful, staff was so friendly and the location is perfect. I could have stayed forever! I hope to be back"
"Manager was so kind and reliable. If you have any problem, recommend to ask her to fix it asap so that you can  find best solution and keep enjoying trip continuously."
"If you are looking for simplicity off the beaten path, this place is heaven. The staff are wonderfully kind and helpful. A delicious breakfast was provided. There are lovely shops, coffee and restaurants in short walking distance. Views are breathtaking. 
Star rating accurate."
"The staff very friendly and helpful, and the beach view is amazing😍"
"This place is off the beaten track and you really need a scooter to get around. In saying that I recommend you get yourself some motorbike lessons because this place is worth it. Located on the beach, the grounds are full of day beds with comfortable fat pillows to lounge on and look at the ocean, or watch the amazing sunsets. The beds were large and comfortable and the pool was clean and the water not too cold. 
Breakfast was adequate, but basic, with western and Asian options.  They have some problems with hot water here, so be prepared to have a cold shower. It was so hot I didn't mind too much, but I was there in the middle of January. That aside, this place is the worth the stay."
Location had a great view. Staff very helpful and even got dinner for us from outside. WiFi is not great though.
"Excellent and extremely helpfull staff, especially Ms Annie. Also not forgetting the other staff like Putu,Adi and Narto who always attended to our request. Besides the people whom manage the resort the view and place to unwind on the deck is superb."
"The staff were very friendly, they attended to my every need. 
You definitely get what you pay for, so don’t expect above and beyond. The aircon s were icy cold. They attend to your room every day. Breakfast is simple but tasty. 
I would recommend to anyone seeking peaceful, roomy accomodation. Who doesn’t expect too much . It’s bang for your buck."
"Big room with lots of windows , balcony, and partial ocean view.
Good aircon. Had some problems with toilet."
The Family  rooms are big enough to accomodate four of us. The provide breakfast in the morning. The resort are very quite and nice for few nights stayed. Definately will came back again.
"My upgrade to sea front apartment made it !
Unfortunately the food side needs a huge improvement.
The team the staff are a delight"
just exceptional
Ocean front property in a quiet area.
"Right on the coast , a pool + the sea inside a breakwater.  Day beds to lounge on. Nice clean rooms. Best of all, the staff. Lenny and her team are doing a great job with the running of the hotel in difficult times. Thank you all. I hope to be back one day soon"
"Staff was very nice, a little bit remote, need transport Motorbike. Accommodation was very clean and good value for money. Good place to just chill out for two or three days."
"The beachfront location of this boutique property is lovely. The gardens are nice and Leni and her team are great hosts.  Perhaps some cash injected to take it from good to great. Doesn’t have to be major changes just a few small ones. For example new linen, bath mats and toilet seats in the rooms. Clean the driveway and perhaps some of the garden furniture may have expired. I understand the hotel is only just taking guests after being closed so will take some time."
"Excellent value. Basic but spacious room, but to be expected given the relatively cheap price and perfectly adequate four our family short stay. Enjoyed the swimming right in front of the hotel. The quality of the free breakfast could have been better. The restaurant menu was simple, but the food we had was of a reasonable standard."
"What i like the most is the sea view... the manager also take care of us during our stay. Rooms is not so, as its old and outdated. Not for fussy people, still must see..."
The hotel was a little far from local house and its also very quite. Looks like its been empty for a while because of covid. The staff were friendly and the price was affordable
Great view nice room but the bed made me itchy all night and the hot water won't come out and shower water not working properly. The wifi didn't get into the room so I need to get out of the room near the lobby where the signal is stronger. And i was kinda disappointed with the breakfast. Hope they fixed the water and the hygiene of the bed and also the hot water it would be the best amazing place to stay.
"Good pool
Good views
Food average 
No gas for cooking and furniture broke which got charged 50,000 for a coffee table that was already broken and glued.
Best to hire a scooter to go down to the market of shops.
Need better signage to find it.
Overall good but wouldn't recommend"
"Everything broken, boss refused to speak with me, stayed here three years ago, 99%better! Do not waste your time and money!"
"This place was disgusting. I left 2 days early, because it was so gross. Towel had obvious stains all over it, the dry wall had mould on it, and was painted over. The ceiling in the bathroom was nonexistent, their was a sheet to cover the hole. No hot water to take a shower. Their was a hole in my mattress, and they covered it up with yellow fabric. 
I talked to the couple that had rented the room the day prior and they, weren’t impressed either. The pictures they display on the website are very outdated pictures. 
I was definitely “catfished” with this room.
Giving them one star is definable way too generous."
"It really does not look like the pictures. It is not clean. The sheets are always stained and the room itself was not clean. They have a pool but there are no sun beds, since they all are broken and the beach out front is not a beach where you can be in the sand, as you have to walk away from the hotel to do that. Overall the hotel looks abandoned and they have a big sign where it says they are selling the place. It all looks like it is about to fall apart.
We were supposed to be there for 5 nights but after 2 nights we decided to go. 
I can really see the potential of the place and how it has been in the past but now it is not good at all. 
Would not recommend!!"

NOT RECOMMENDED
"Our stay at the Crystal Beach Bali Hotel was great. It's directly at the ocean with jungle on the other side. Our driver didn't know the place,but you can always tell them its in the same street as the Sea Breeze Candidasa, only further down the road.
The room came with a fan, aircon and TV (no english channels). Wifi worked well. The bathroom was shared with one other room and had a washing machine. 
The garden was really nice and green, with a nice small pool. There is plenty of coral right in front of the hotel. Unfortunately the low tide was too low to snorkel over it into the deeper water and on the second day it was too windy to get into the water. But I'm sure it's usually a great place to snorkel. 
In the evening we went to a restaurant, and to our surprise it was closer then expected. We had a nice walk along the jungle road, tip: bring a torch its pretty dark in places and I felt saver, as the scooters could see us better that way. There are few little shops and maybe 3 restaurants not too far away. We didnt like the German restaurant (the Balinese staff was incredibly slow with everything, not friendly, my food came out of the freezer and had no taste at all), its well worth it to walk a little bit further to a much nicer place with very friendly staff and tasty food.
In the morning we had our breakfast outside on a sheltered terrace with a stunning ocean view. There was even a rainbow over the bay. The breakfast was very good compared to our hotel before. Fresh fruit, banana pancake and toast and eggs on the second day.
We loved the quietness, it's still called a backpackers on the sign, but you won't find any partying backpackers out there. There were only a handful of others staying there. They are building more rooms at the moment, so there was some noise from that, but we got up early anyway so didnt mind.   
All together this was a very nice stay and I can recommend it to anyone, who wants to get out of the busy city for a while."
"We enjoyed our stay at the Crystal Beach Bali Hotel and would have extended our stay had we not been back-ended. Would definitely come back and recommend it to others. The hotel is a little difficult to find, but once you are there it is paradise. The location is in a village between Padangbai and Candidasa - so away from hustle and bustle. Leila the manager is extremely helpful and a wonderful person."
"We had a lovely stay at Crystal Beach. The room was large and comfortable, staff were lovely. The hotel itself is really pretty and well located with lovely views to the ocean. Lots of hammocks, deck chairs and beds are scattered around so as to enjoy the hotel and it's surroundings. When we arrived, we ordered lunch from the hotel restaurant. It was absolutely delicious in every way - far above our expectations for a cheaper hotel! It's such a shame therefore that the breakfast (included in all bookings here) was - sorry to say, disgusting. It was a buffet with cold, oily vial tasting foods. They even managed to only include the worst bits of the fruit for the fruit salad. I saw them bring out a new batch and there were no good bits. We had half a plate and gave up. I believe the idea is that if you provide awful food it will encourage people to not go back for seconds. It was so bad that we couldn't face going back to the restaurant for lunch as we knew that that breakfast had been cooked in the same kitchen. Surely - if they had not included breakfast in the deal and taken a pound off - or added a pound and made something edible it would leave the customer with a better taste in the mouth. As an overal review I would leave 4 stars as everything else was great."
"I randomly found this place and have now staid multiple times. Each time extending my stay. 
1. Annie - who runs the place and works the front desk is amazing! Her english is excellent and she is so happy and helpful. She will help you accomplish whatever you need. 
2. Great location
3. Mixture of room types means that you get to interact with people travelling in all ways. 
4. Very clean!
5. Coffee and sunrise / sunset on the deck is amazing! 
I highly recommend Crystal Beach Bali Hotel!"
"Crystal Beach Hotel is a little difficult to find for drivers who don't know the Candidasa area well. I really enjoyed the stunning water views we had from our apartment looking out through the coconut palms and tropical gardens. There is an attractive small pool and it is also possible to swim in the ocean. It was a very high tide for most of the daylight hours  when we were there so I didn't venture in. There is virtually no beach. 
Our appartment was very spacious and I loved the decor of the upstairs bedroom. The stairs going up were very steep which might be a problem for the elderly or infirm. There were two terrace areas - upstairs and downstairs each with a small table and two chairs.
The kitchenette section downstairs was equipped with a 4 burner gas stove which we didn't use,cutlery and some plates. There was only one glass and one mug. There was an electric jug, a large fridge and a supply of cold and hot aqua water.
The bathroom was semi outdoors but covered in with a translucent roof. It was spacious and the hot water was very good but the whole bathroom was extremely hot as the air conditioning fan outlet was there. At times it felt like a sauna!
Despite this I loved my time at Crystal Beach, The young female staff were very sweet and keen to be helpful. The location is so peaceful and the surrounding area very unspoilt and tranquil.There are some good restaurants close by at other hotels and a popular warung as well."
"The staff at Crystal beach are always ready to help , Annie , Oke, Ipnu ( I hope I spelled your name correctly :)) and the rest of the staff are super friendly. Our room is a one bedroom apartment and it is right at the beach front, fantastic view and where else can you walk only a few steps outside of your room and can snorkel first thing in the morning before breakfast. We did enjoyed the buffet breakfast as well. You can order food from the hotel and not worry about heading into town for foods, they do offer free shuttles into town by the way should you like to check it out . Best of all they have 3 residence dogs that I 've love to play with everyday that we were there. We love this place so much that we are planning our next trip already. Thank you all the staff at Crystal beach for having us and hope to see you all very very soon."
Absolute surprise accommodation in Candidasa  I wouldn’t normally stay so far away the main stretch but this is no problem at Crystal Beach with five or so free shuttles back n forth every 120 minutes and or cheap scooter hire. Crystal Beach Hotel is clean and affordable and the staff GREAT – Annie keep up the good work and see you next time 
"Our family of 5 booked two apartments, which meant that the whole building right by the sea was ours. The apartments were wellkept and looked nice, the bathrooms were especially beautiful. We really enjoyed the pool, you can swim in the sea but we preferred the pool. The sea is great for snorkeling you can also rent snorkeling gear from the hotel. The staff is so lovely and amazing - thank you! There weren't many options at breakfast but the food from the menu was absolutely amazing. We hope to return to crystal beach the next time we're in Bali."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Crystal Beach Resort, so much so that I kept extending it! If I could I would have definitely stayed longer! I'm currently backpacking and this was a welcome rest and a bit of luxury but still on a backpackers budget. The hotel is located in a quiet area of Candi Dasa away from the town but they provide a free shuttle service for whenever you need to get there although I stayed at the hotel most of the time as I had everything I needed here, pool, comfy beds overlooking the sea and fantastic food and drinks. The staff are extremely helpful, friendly and welcoming especially Annie who runs the place incredibly well and is the loveliest lady! The resort is very well kept with gardeners and cleaners who come into the room every day,  breakfast is very nice with a food selection so there is something for everyone. I would highly recommend this hotel and I know I will come back here again without a doubt!"
"I had such a relaxing time that I stayed another night-and still didn't want to leave! I live in Bali and it was so nice to stay somewhere so quiet. Yes, it's a 20 minute stroll to the main road and another 20 minutes stroll to Candidasa but, both are very pleasant and I walked them during the day and at night (I am a single female). There are small shops and restaurants on the first stretch of road and many more on the main road to Candidasa. In addition, the hotel shuttle to Candidasa is every two hours there/return, so there is really no trouble to move around.
The staff were all very friendly and the breakfast was fantastic. I look forwarding to returning."
"If you want to feel the perfect relax, you have to visit Crystal Beach hotel. The accomodation is perfect. We were in a family deluxe room with terrace. There were two enormous very comfortable beds. The room was cleaned every day. We had a breakfast included in room price, although we understood when we arrived. Annie - the receptionist arranged everything for us - a driver for a whole day trip, motorbikes, great very cheap massages, a food delivery. We kindly recomend this hotel."
"We were given a 'free' upgrade to the new part of the hotel. At first I was excited until I discovered that it was to the back of the property and upstairs. The disappointment came when we realised that we would not be overlooking the beach in the way we had been looking forward to as the older building has balconys that get the afternoon breeze. Our room was rather hot with the big windows and none could be opened. The Balcony area was not very big and overlooked the land next door. It's not to say that the room is terrible but the furniture has obviously been transferred from other rooms and attempts made to give it a new look.....but a slice of granite laid dangerously atop a cabinet isn't something to rave about. The aircon struggles to cool the room with the massive windows facing the sun pretty much all day. The other sad part was hearing our European neighbours screaming at their child and at each other, loud and clear, if they hadn't left the next day we would have cancelled our stay.
Otherwise our stay here was enjoyable enough once the initial disappointment wore off. The room was comfortable and we ended up staying longer even though it's a fair way out of the central ""Candidasa"" area. We enjoyed the location and the pool area, also the day beds overlooking the ocean are enjoyable (excluding the cigarette butts left by other tourists) and they seem to be building the area more. The area is good for exploring especially if you have your own transport otherwise the staff can assist. The breakfast is reasonable if you get in while it's warm, the staff were kind enough to let me have Bali kopi instead of nescafe.
Would we stay again? Possibly, but we'd prefer to try the beachfront rooms."
"We stayed 2 nights in Crystal Beach Hotel and it was just excellent time so we don't want to leave. Location is great, hiding in the jungle with absolutely stunning view, beach front location, nice garden with swimming pool, wooden terrace and many chill out beds to enjoy sea breeze and view of Nuda Penida!
Rooms are totally cool, with nice quality wooden furniture, super nice and comfortable bed, clean and spacious bathroom and balcony with great view to the jungles and sea. You will have everything incl. wifi, smart tv, fridge, AC, hot water, room service, Free! laundry and Free buffet style breakfast with good choice.
Thanks a lot for hosting us and wish u a great time and happiness!!"
Staff were friendly and helpful. Great value for the dollar. I would not only recommend Crystal beach to my friends and family but in addition am am looking forward to my next holiday so my family can stay there again! I would rate Crustal beach Bali Hotel two thumbs up:) It was perfect.
"The apartment we booked which built as 2 floors, just the same as you see in the pictures on here, large bedroom on upper floor, beautiful scenery with ocean view, ground floor is a mini kitchen and outdoor bathroom. 
Laila (staff) is a very kind and helpful, I loved her homemade toast breakfast. 
We did snorkeling in hotel private seaside (not a beach in all), just in front of the hotel, from the picture, you see a railing, we swam from there and if you swim a bit further away you will see numerous beautiful corals and mini fishes, the water is clear. 
I hope we’d stayed longer, the area is so quiet, not like Kuta, you see rarely visitors in here.   
The only grey comment we have is they should have more snorkel equipment to borrow, at least a pair set for two person. Again the air-conditioner is not cold enough, I don't know is it better if another air-con can turn on together. 
Also, if you ask the hotel to book in advance for airport pickup , please ask for what kind of the  car model will be offered. There are about 2 hours driving from the airport.  
Lastly, we enjoy to stay at Crystal Beach hotel, environment here is wonderful, recommend for couples and small family."
"We arrived Candidasa, Bali, late evening and has difficulty to locate this hotel as it is located off the main road. However, when we called the hotel, the staff came out to meet us at the main road and kindly guided us to the hotel. I stayed in a 2-storey apartment complete with kitchen. The apartment faces the beach and one can hear continuous melody of the waves beating the beach day and night. There was also a decent swimming pool. Our stay was very enjoyable and relaxed. It is advisable to have own transport for this place."
"Where do I start? Big clean rooms, most comfortable beds we’ve had in 14 weeks in Asia, relaxing areas all over the lovely gardens & beachfront area, literally right on the beach, great breakfast buffet with self cook egg station. 
Restaurant with good food at prices you can’t really beat locally.
It’s a bit out of the way but they even provide a free shuttle bus into Candidasa! Free snorkelling equipment to use whenever you like & a lovely little pool for cooling off.
Annie & her staff are superb & will help you out with anything.
One little negative...the owner’s dogs are lovely & very well behaved but if you’re going to have dogs at a hotel, you need someone to clean up the dog pooh at least once a day!"
"I had a 3 day Intensive Conference at Villa Jukung (which happpened to be right next door) and Crystal Beach was the perfect location. My partner decided to come along for the trip and the room was comfortable, bed comfy and we had everything we needed to make it a great stay. We even extended for 2 nights and were pretty sad to leave. The beach is beautiful, lots of fish and nice reef, and the Staff, especially Annie, the Manager was an absolute delight. She was so accommodating and made our stay incredible easy and smooth.  They have a complimentary shuttle into town and they made a special breakfast as we had some dietry requirements. The place is hidden so its very quiet, the only that would make this place even better was if it had white sand instead of black. We would return and highly recommend.  Oh. We stayed in the Junior Suite."
"Heard good things about Candidasa and wanted to see for ourselves. Chose this hotel for proximity to ocean and reasonable price. Very impressed. Fantastic spot down a small side road opening out to an impressive oceanfront property with wonderful staff who were friendly and helpful with any and all requests. Shuttle available every 2 hours but didn't use it as we rented a scooter (through the hotel staff) to get out and about. Food at the hotel good quality and very good price, a great back up if too lazy or relaxed to go out. Room itself could do with a little maintenance, but nothing that detracted from the peace and quiet we were after."
"Best Value/Price-Ratio I every had, paid for a very good room with aircon-wifi-bath with hot water & breakfast 180.000 IDR which is about 11 Euro. Looking at the map it looks a bit outside of candidasa-city. But in candidasa: there is just a road where people want to sell thingsto you. Just outside this place is a very nice and beautiful authentic village with some small shops and warungs. there is really no need to go to candidasa except for the ATM. Anyway, they have a free shuttle-service to town! I booked 3 days and stayed finally 11 days there. A great place to chill out and not to forget the friendly staff!!"
"Omg the first time i came this place is wonderful😍😍and the second visit this place had some changing,and that looks more amazziiiingggggg,,,,
I love to staying in crystal beach candidasa,,,,
You gonna see me soon 😍😍😍😍😍
Can't wait"
"A quaint hotel by the sea, run by friendly and accomodating women. 
Big and clean rooms with comfy bed. Super quiet area, great for chilling out and relax by the sea. 
Good buffet breakfast with fresh fruit that you can enjoy on the sea front.
Nice restaurants up the road and a great coffee place, Oketo Cafe 10 minutes' walk - with the best homemade cinnammon roll ever!"
"I'm so thankful for the perfect hospitality of the staffs. They are extremely warm-hearted and generous. To Ms. Leni and Mr. Kade, God bless you more ❤️"
"Large rooms, comfortable bed and big windows. The place is a bit retrieved with not much around. There is no beach that is super accessible it is mostly an area for diving and snorkeling. Mrs Leni and her staff were super nice and well intentioned. The place could use a few upgrades but after Covid times i understand it is hard to do so. Not a place for picky people. We definitely enjoyed our stay here."
Awesome staff. A little hidden Gem right on the ocean.
"The staff are nice.
We ordered standard room but they upgraded to family room. 
Pet friendly 
Has private beach 
Nice view"
They no longer have a swimming pool and is quite a basic place to stay. But the room was clean and staff are lovely. Needs a lot of maintenance in the outside area.
"Quiet and relaxing place, breakfast choice must be improved, friendly and helpful staff. Between coconuttrees and bananagardens. No sandbeach. You have to rent a bike to be flexible to move to other beaches or Padang Bai for ferry to Lombog. Good place."
"Super relaxing place right on the ocean.  The front desk staff was a total sweetheart.  The day beds on the ocean front were a perfect place to lounge and relax.  And the massage for 100k they offer is definitely worth trying, the massage therapist who came was one of the best I've had in Bali."
"This is my second time here, love the location of this hotel and how quiet its , definitely will come back ."
"Great vista over the Bali Sea. Serene destination. No sandy beach but amazing branch coral you can swim over at high tide; make it out past the big stone barriers to the fish and coral channels. Seafront bungalow is an odd setup, with the bedroom up the steepest stairs I have ever encountered in an accommodation. Style is dingy corporate apartment. Great breakfast and top rate manager Annie. Off main road down a long lane, pretty isolated."
"If you get the budget room - just don’t.
The shared bathroom is also a laundry and right next to the food prep area in the mornings so waaaay too loud.
I’d you get any of the other rooms, they are excellent. But cost double the budget for our week long stay. 
Also - get a scooter, it was great to be able to zip around and have a look at what is around the place.
The food was nice, the staff were awesome! 
The pool was so good!"
"The best . about this hotel is the staff, Annie was very sweet and polite. The place is very quiet , ideal for relaxing. Breakfast is quite poor though ."
"Best breakfast in days!! So huge, a lot of choices, all you can eat.
The amazing staff! 
The amazing view!"
"Tolle Lage, direkt am Meer. Sehr romantisch. Tolle Zimmer"
"From camping to full suits with kitchenettes they have all the optiond available. The facilities are the same for everyone so its super great for backpackers maybe not so much for people paying for more expendive accomodations but it's a good choice anyways.
Our kids would have loved the dogs that roam around as well, unfortunately they visibly had flees and we had to keep them away as mich as we could...
Breakfast is self served eggs but limited... As we as some cereal fruit, leftovers from dinner such as rice and pasta... Not bad. Lunch and dinner csn be ordered from the menu and it's actually really good at good prices, congrats to the kitchen team."
"Great place to stay, nice new rooms. In the garden there are beds and sits were you can enjoy the seaview all day. 
Snorkeling is just a few stairs away.
Staff is very kind, Annie the host even ordered a birthday cake for my daughter.
Small pool but enough. 
Breakfast is buffet with lots of choice and the food and drinks in the restaurant are good.
The Hotel is not in the center of Candi Dasa but they have a free shuttle taxi 
We had fun!"
"Great Price, Great Location. Great Stuff"
One of the best views of the ocean. Nice place to stay and I love the place
"This is a very peaceful place to stay, right up against the ocean, and was our favorite place in Bali this trip. There are heaps of sitting areas to enjoy, from the deck overlooking the ocean to day beds and swinging seats. The swimming pool was popular with the kids and you can snorkel straight off the resort and instantly see coral and heaps of fish (watch out to the left of the steps as you go down as there is a tangle of metal that was popular with angel fish but would not be fun to drop onto). Best bring your own gear for snorkeling.
The staff are excellent with good English. Annie the manager is an absolute treasure (we think her boss should give her a pay rise) and went out of her way to help with anything we needed.
The room was large, fridge & air-conditioner cold. Their Shrimp Kway Teow, Calamari and Thai Fried Rice are very tasty and fairly priced.
We will definitely come back again."
"In my 10 days long tour in Bali this is the best hotel. Miss Anni, the in charge of the hotel was very professional and also helpful. We were very happy to stay there. Hotel location and also view is awesome. You can stay in hotel without activities by enjoying hotel view. Room, service , washroom is just perfect. Breakfast in buffet is just delicious. There is a Kichen so u can cook anything. Most impressive thing is free water. I just wonder this service. Love to stay there, hope to stay here again."
"I booked this place with Agoda but the price is more expensive than booking directly on place... Exclude the price from Agoda, everything is perfect, amazing place!"
"NEXT TIME WE WILL STAY FOR A MONTH. SILENT ON THE BEACH.
VERY GOOD FOOD WORTH TO STAY FOR LONG RELAXING HOLIDAY.
STAFF ARE LOVING AND CARING. THE KITCHEN STAFF ARE REALLY GREAT.
WE FELT AT HOME WITH BEST LUXURY."
Awesome value in a fantastic location
"Great value, really nice staff. Needed scooters to get around as it’s a few kilometres out. Traffic not nearly as busy as other areas so this was inexpensive and fun."
"Stay here for a night during our visit to Candidasa. Best if you bring your own car/motorbike, since the location is a bit isolated (but it’s good; no crowd). 
Room was nice and clean. AC worked like a charm during a hot humid day. But the communal room on the third floor might need some fan or AC, since it’s boiling during daytime, and there are no windows to open. 
Free water at the dispenser (hot and cold), which is a plus. From here to the center will take around 10mins driving, in case you want to eat outside. 
Breakfast is okay, with rice, toast, sweet bread, and pudding."
"Great location for those looking to kill a day or chill in Candidasa. Snorkelling right off the property, plenty of places to lounge and short biking distance to stores, the main beach, and some of the village hiking.  Only negatives --- buffet was a bit too oily for my taste and the cheap room is right next to the reception meaning you have a shared bathroom with quite a few people in the mornings (didn't bug us at all really)"
"Must book property. They have all facilities present as listed on website. Perfect location for snorkeling. They have cute dogs which made my stay more memorable. Good spacious rooms, perfect environment, helpful staff. Breakfast is not at all good but I think it's comprising. Definitely will be back soon. Missing cute dogs. Home like stay."
Thankyou to Crystal Beach Hotel as a solo traveller it was so welcoming location is ideal for exploring the East hope to return again.
"Out of town but free shuttle bus, and warungs and small stores within a reasonable walk.  Good snorkeling place. We adored our stay and wanted to stay longer than 4 days."
"Beautiful ocean. Puppies. Good food. Outdoor Lounges overlooking the sea. 
Economy double has bathroom separate from the room. But the ac is ice cold and bed is comfortable."
"Just terrific. Wifi a bit hit and miss in the rooms, but that was the ONLY downside. Loved it here."
"Delux with terrace: Don’t come here with expectations of swish facilities and the latest movies. Come here instead happy for comfortable family rooms, a very simple but adequate breaky, the usual peaceful and hospitable attitude of Bali culture, with access to trekking, snorkeling, sight-seeing or simply laying in the many outdoor mattresses with your feet up, to read a book or write to friends. 
The hotel is remote, so provision of everything is more difficult. They do a pretty great job of it. Shuttles to town every 2 hrs. Some really nice places to eat there. 
Cons: lobby pictures on Agoda are wide-angle so it looks WAY bigger than it actually is.  You make your own eggs on a frypan on a portable gas burner - can get quite squeeze if more than a few guests are there at the same time.  In-room wifi is weak (Lobby is good).  Flies are an issue with several pet dogs around (but my girls loved playing with them and want to go back).
Overall: great value and 4/5 for its class."
"Beautiful place, friendly staff, a great stay for dad and 2 young boys."
"Very nice and cozy. I stayed there at the hostel. Comfortable room with five beds. The staff is autumn polite and smiling, especially the girl Ani. I went back there four times and want to come back again. Wonderful place! The only negative is bad internet."
Only complaint is that the outdoor day bed mattresses were molding a little as they where kept outside all the time. At the very least clean blankets or dherts should be given to perspective tanners
The location is a bit too far from the city but I loved it as it was quiet and peaceful and overall a great experience. I loved the staffs and the beach deck breakfast
My wife and I went here two years ago on our honeymoon while she wasn’t pregnant and loved it so much we came back with our 18 month old daughter. The room is great with an incredible view. The garden and pool are awesome. Snorkeling right out the back yard is really cool. And the staff is off the charts. The manager Annie is half the reason we returned. The place and staff felt like family. Can’t recomend this place enough! We LOVE it!
"The dorm (only female) was nice and only had 5 beds. The bathroom was located one minute away and clean, although the showers had no shelf space. A mirror was missing.
The breakfast was great, it was a small buffet (cakes, toast, jam, butter, fruit, coffee, tea and fried rice/noodles) and you could cook your own eggs. They also have a bar in the evening and a restaurant that serves food all day. 
As the location is a bit out of the center the hotel provides several shuttles to and from the center.
The pool was nice but the best were the sunbeds right in front of the sea. 
The wifi didn't really work in the dorm but was good close to the reception.
The staff was really friendly and helpful and always said good morning in the guests different languages."
"A sign out the front of the place advertises for Backpackers... it would be nice to know this BEFORE you book with them, considering their name states HOTEL in their title! 
The whole place is rundown and very old, the staff were completely rude and wanted us to pay 300,000rp before they would even show us our room (we refused and left). 
The lady at reception would not talk to my driver when we had questions, she just made out like she didn’t understand us and then refused to communicate with our Balinese driver. 
If you’re a backpacker it might be ok accomodation. However, we are a family with 2 children and this place was not safe for the kids, despite our communication with the hotel prior to arrival stating we have 2 children. 
I am now fighting with AGODA to get a REFUND OR CREDIT for what we paid and didn’t get to use.  It seems Agoda is very quick to take my money for a hotel, but refuses to issue a refund when the room does not look like it does in the photos.  MISLEADING!"
Very quiet and helpfully staff! Thank you so much-:)..We will back again..
"womderful staff, great ambience, the hotel is so beautiful with the amazing garden, swimming pool and direct access to the see, shuttle to candi dasi every hour, great ambience. The best stay in Bali so far."
"Starting with picking us up from the bus stop, to lending us fins, free water refill, hot water for our coffees, to buying baby gooling at local price for us, free banana fritters, dropping us up at the beach, finding another couple to share the taxi fare to the airport... The list of services the family offered and their kindness made our stay special. The accomodation itself was really good, nice specious room, comfy bed with mousquito net, bathroom with hot shower, sink and mirror, cupboard, dressing table, balcony with sea view, really good especially for the price, definitely the best value for money we found in the Amed region. We rented a scooter from there too, good price; the breakfast was good, you have a choice: we had banana pancake (you could have eggs instead) which came with fruits and coffee (you can have a juice instead). The location is great, in between Jemeluk and Lipah beach. Would definitely stay there again and recommend it. Thank you so very much. 😊"
"The view is also really nice, the perfect place to relax and calm down!"
"We weren’t expecting much but were impressed by the garden when we arrived. It’s really chill with beds along the sea with a nice view on the mountains. The pool is really confortable too. The terrace just in front of the lobby is very nice to watch the sunset. 
We booked the standard room, which was okay for the price but it was just next to the kitchen and we had all the smells from the kitchen. And the shared bathroom wasn’t really clean. 
But I would totally recommend it for the price !"
Loved the amazing breakfast and comfy beds.  My favorite part was all the awesome daybeds with a view!  The management can set up tours and transport for you and are always so friendly.
Staff was great. Unfortunately there was fresh blood on the under side of the blanket. There was a spider in my bed as well.
"really enjoyed our stay. everyone was friendly, it was clean and everything was as it should be. the only negative was that the noise insulation on the budget double room wasn't great so you could hear the breakfast staff getting the buffet ready at 6.30 (and the washing machine). Apart from that though it was perfect"
"I booked for 3 nights and I stayed  5 . I slept in the dorm, the place is clean, with confortable bed, locker, and the breakfast is amaizing, the best I ever had in Asia. The staff is friendly, helpful and you can book a fabulous massage. I recommend this place really quiet with a beautiful view and lovely matress to relax on the beach.
I look forward to stay here again."
Nice hotel not much to do in the area. Friendly staff. Pool is small. Pictures are misleading.so be careful when you book.  The breakfast is ok. A lot of deep fried foods. Overall we enjoyed our 4 nights.
"actually this place is more like villa, not a hotel, the facilities such as toiletries, building structure, etc not like a hotel. but this place provide very beautiful scenery, because the location is on the beach (literally), so we can playing sand on the beach when low tide, or we can snorkeling when tide. the minus of this place are, the location is far away from airport and it like the hidden place, so we need more effort to reach it. but all of the minuses are paid off when we on the site. overall satisfy with the place"
"The place is a gorgeous and quiet resort type looking out onto the crystal blue waters of the sea. The staff, especially the receptionist Anna, were wonderful. The room I stayed in was stunning with great wifi and aircon. The breakfast is delicious with local and continental options. A wonderful place!"
"Very nice staff!
Annie is amazing! Nice pool and free shuttle service to Candidasa!
Everything was perfect!
Food in the restaurant not the best!
But a lot of nice warung nearby!
Highly recommended!"
"The hotel staff are friendly, the whole area of the hotel are clean the food served for breakfast are decent.
The room is really beautiful the bed design are unique, towels and other toiletries are provided. I love the sitting area by the beach, you can order your food and have them served there. So you can enjoy your meal with an amazing view."
"really good view, just on the beach,  lots of corals around their if you like snorkle you can do it around.  every evening you see the good sun set.  bit interier 30 mins from candidasa by walk. 
great staff,  manager annie very polite and try speak many language to greet and help people around the world . 
chef is great nice food for reasonable price. 
you will love it.  this is my second time here."
great quite location good food and service really nice Accomadation
"Originally booked for 3 nights and extended to five (like several other travelers). Stayed in the 6-bed mixed dorm, bed was comfortable, and locker is large enough to fit a full backpack. Best: unlimited breakfast buffet with many delicious choices on awesome terrace overlooking the sea; free shuttle available every hour to get a ride into or back from the town center; lots of comfy platforms with mattresses & pillows to relax, watch the sea and sunrise/sunset; quiet other than hearing the sea. The entire place has lovely landscaping. There isn't a sandy beach (you can swim when it's high tide, but watch the stones/coral), but beaches are within a short bike ride. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Downside for dorm: bathroom is all the way over in the main building, not near the dorm. WIFI in dorm & hot water in shower can be temperamental."
Staff wonderful and very accommodating.
"We stay just for one night, it's a lovely place, hopefully we can come again."
"Everything is a standout. The grounds, pool, breakfast, food but especially the staff. Annie, the manager knows all the answers, she'll help you more than you thought possible and she's pretty funny too. Your perfect destination choice at Candi Dasa! Try it, you'll be impressed."
the room itself was good but it was just beside the reception and the bfast buffet.. so we were woken up by noise outside the room. the location of the room was just not right.. otherwise annie the manager is pretty nice and helpful.
"Nice breakfast. Annie was very helpful. Worthwhile hiring a scooter every day for only $5, to see the temples and beaches in the area, but be careful the roads are very busy and fast but go at your own pace keeping to the left."
"My girlfriend and I booked originally for 2 nights being unsure whether we’d like the area. We soon extended an extra day due to the wonderful staff here, excellent room sizes and decent facilities. The pool is quite small but clean. That didn’t bother us though as the sea is just a few handy stairs away!  Easy, friendly shuttle car can take you into town for some bargain hunting ad food in the evening. Annie (front desk) was particularly friendly and helpful and made our stay one of the best. So warm and bubbly whenever we saw her. It’s because of her (and the puppies!) this is one of the best places we’ve stayed in Indonesia. For the money this is a brilliant place. We would both highly recommend it to anyone in the Candi Dasa area."
There is no beach and everything is a little far from the property. Not suitable for young children.
"good hotel, located on the ocean, you can swim, but many corals, there is a shuttle service, paid separately, breakfasts are meager, greasy, but if you ask, omelet or scrambled eggs, then do not fat, dinner and dinner can be at the hotel prices are acceptable, the boss the cook cooks very tasty, the administrator is just super super, she learns the Russian language, will help in any matter, the view from the room is good - these are the pros, out of the minuses are interruptions with hot water and weak Internet!"
"Got an upgrade and the place plus staff is so nice. The only thing they should change is the loud dangdut music at sunset time. It doesn’t fit the place so please no more loud annoying music when we enjoy the views. 

The lady at the reception was so nice, Think she manage the place. Thumbs up For You!! We Will be back"
"Booked in a rush; did not notice that we had to share the bathroom (now it makes sense why the price was really good).
We got the room next to the kitchen so it’s very busy during bfast time. We absolutely loved our surrounding though! It’s in the village so if you go out at night, make sure your vehicle has working lights."
It was a cook your own breakfast
"We spent 4 nights here, during our stay it was Nyepi (Day of Silence) and it was the perfect place to relax all day.  The pool is great and especially loved the outdoor beds for lounging. Breakfast was delicious with new foods to try. Very friendly staff! I hope we can return one day in the future!"
"I loved this hostel from the minute I walked onto the property. I will just go ahead and say that I was staying in the dorm, and I was blown away by the price for what was offered here. The pool is great, the view is incredible for sunrise and sunset, the breakfast... THE BREAKFAST! Makes it feel like you're not actually staying in a dorm. Best part about this hostel by far was Annie who works and lives here. Such a ray of sunshine. Lastly, the puppies. I can't dislike a hostel with a golden retriever :)"
I had a wonderful stay here staying in a five bed room. The staff were so friendly and helpful. They provided a shuttle bus to the centre of Candidasa and had a beautiful pool. We had total ocean views and any number of day beds to choose from to wile your life away. The breakfast was great too. The introduced all different types of Balinese food. The staff couldn’t do enough to help if I needed it. I would recommend this very budget accommodation.
"Top stay, very kind, best free breakfast and cannot best $8 room on beautiful beach with in house massage by the pool."
