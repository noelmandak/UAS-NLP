"I almost don't want people to know about this place. Perfect location right outside Shipwrecks, right on the beach, clean comfortable and super friendly. These people feel like family :) I have arrived back after 3 years away and they now have a fantastic seafood bbq on the beach each night. Fresh fish and super tasty.
Their rooms are great - simple but all you need - they are clean with really comfortable king sized beds. The location is private and quiet on the beachfront with easy access to everything - it's not often you find a balance like this. Give it a go :)"
Yogi and his family and crew are an amazing group of people that make you feel like family. They take care of everything for you and make sure you have the best time. The food is delicious and so cheap. The space and facilities is way more that what I expected for the good price. Such a relaxing and totally enjoyable place to stay! Cannot wait to go back again!
"I highly recommend Yogi Beach Bungalow. The location was absolutely perfect. Right on the beach with the most delicious fresh fish cooked on the bbq every sunset. We spent a week there and the staff felt like family. They were so friendly, kind and caring and my daughter thrived off seeing their smiling faces everyday."
Yogi beach bungalows is very beautiful and right on the beach. The place is very clean and well priced for the place. Many great restaurants nearby.
Also has a resident cat that came to say hello!  Their breakfast was also nice and healthy with delicious jamu when the restaurant is open.
"I went surfing at shipwrecks, which is right out the front, an easy paddle or pay the aqua taxi man 25000 each way, and he parks his boat right out the front. 
Staff very friendly and helpful. 
Units clean and cleaned daily, only thing is they could use new pillows (the current ones are pretty hard).
Can hire a SUP from them too explore the 'lagoon'area too if you like that kinda thing."
"We loved this place for a small beach getaway from Ubud where we live, staff lovely and the location on the beach was perfect. Right next door to a great cafe where we had breakfast most mornings."
I took my family with 4 1/2 year old twins they’re on the suggestion of a friend in Bali. The staff was excellent the location is right in front of two surf breaks one a beginner one an intermediate and advanced wave. We had a fabulous barbecued fish dinner both nights. The staff was excellent and we had a great time.
"I regularly travel to Nusa Lembongan and always stay at Yogi Beach. The rooms are clean, staff are fantastic (they’ve become family to me), location is amazing, right on the beach, and very reasonably priced! Highly recommend!!!"
My husband and I loved our stay never wanted to leave.  The location is dreamy and the place is great as well as the owners.  Very nice people.
"Bungalows are very nice and spacious, our was right on the beach. Quiet area, friendly and helpful staff. The food was very nice with tables set on the beach or further back in the shade. Plenty of other restaurant nearby. Would happily stay here again"
Awesome place you will be happy 😊
"Amazons view, staff and bungalows!"
Highly recommend
"Beautiful place, right at the beach. you fall asleep with the sound of the ocean 💙 Very friendly owner & staff. 
absolutely recommended 😊"
"They have all you need very close. Cafe, surfboard hire, bars and restaurants. On site are Sup's, scooter hire and laundry all at good rates.
Rooms good and clean.  
Staff friendly and helpful"
"Great location right on the beach. The staff was kind, helpful and the room was always spotless. Would definitely recommend the Yogi Beach Bungalows!"
"We always stay here, it’s clean and the family who own it are super lovely. Amazing value and right on the best beach on the island."
"Simple, but very good for the price."
Wayan and Nyoman are lovely and we absolutely love staying with them.
Perfect location next door to a few great cafes and warungs. The sand and ocean is clean and bright at the front of the property and the aircon and cleanliness is great. The owners/operators are extremely hospitable. Note no food service onsite due to covid19 at this time.
Right on the beach. Large comfortable room. Bargain price. 10 mins fm ferry..use scoot..
"Great spot right on the beach. Only downside is no tea & coffee making facilities or breakfast available.  But totally loved our stay. Lovely friendly staff, very relaxing & calm."
if possible the the oceanfront bungalow and watch the beautiful sunset from the bed
This hotel is a great location and the cafe next door has some amazing vegan options. The view in the morning is incredible. The bed was a bit too firm for my liking but I did still sleep quite well. The only down side is that the receptionist promised there would be drinking  water in reception and we got back after a late night to no water. All the shops were closed by this point. I would of gone to the shop in advance and bought some of our own had we of known.  Please ensure you have enough gallons of water in reception for your guests or put water machines in the rooms :)
Great spot right on beach .staff helpful  and  friendly. There b.b.q fish is yummy
"Tolle Lage (direkt am Strand)
Trinkwasser for free
Tolle Restaurants in der Nähe"
"Unfortunately this accommodation is let down by its lack of basic requirements. Being good WiFi, a refrigerator, tea & coffee making facilities. Beds are quite ok but pillows are not so good. Water is provided but it is from a large water bottle near the office. Location is great & staff are very friendly. No on site place to eat."
"Location was awesome, no pool but right on the beach. Breakfast wasn’t great but has a really good cafe called zero waste next door (on beach also)"
"Great place where you get good value for your money. We were only  dissapointed in how they dealt with our personal circumstances. I got food poisened the night before we had to check out. In the morning we asked if we could checkout an hour later, so we didn't had to wait for an hour in the heat for our boat departure. Immediately they wanted to charge us 100K which was about 25% of the total room price for 24H."
"Very good  for the price, a bit old but so quiet, wich is precious iland very rare in Bali.
I will definately recommened.
Very good cafe restaurant jist next door, best location."
"I' very been visit bali, gili islands, lombok, many times since 2012，this is truly the worst experience.  We had the room in the  garden next to the kitchen,  after first night sleep next day afternoon started appease some red spots on my shoulders,  i knew it was bad bugs right away,  told stuff over there they just changed new sheet,  make  a new bed, u can tell from their reaction this is not the first time they heard it, and change new sheet wont make any different.  Those bed bug bits could show up few days later..  Then  i got so many red ichy bumps all over my body  ,looks gross and ichy like hell,  can't stop sctatching  can't sleep  at night  . After swimming in the sea salt water  it gets worse.  Totally ruined my whole vacation in bali.... And those bite marks takes one month or longer to disappear.... This is Nightmare came ture"
"We had 7 fantastic days at Nusa Lembongan & loved our stay at Yogi Beach Bungalows. The rooms were large, had cool aircon & clean.  The staff were always friendly & would do anything for you & the location is amazing right in front of Shipwrecks surf break. The family that own these Bungalows take a lot of pride in their gardens & the grounds are well looked after. Breakfast was included in our stay. Choices were Tea, coffee or water / fruit plate or fruit juice / banana pancakes or eggs your way on toast. 
Thank you Yogi for a wonderful stay .. can't wait to come back."
"Yogi Beach Bungalow's was my favourite accommodation by far. Our group booked out 3 of the 4 bungalows for our stay at Nusa Lembongan and we were all very impressed with not only the accommodation and location, but also the friendly service we received from Yogi himself. You would never meet a nicer and more genuine host, and I would highly recommend Yogi Beach Bungalows to anyone looking for fantastic accommodation that surpasses those that charge much more per night. We will defiantly be staying again."
"We stayed their for 2 nights in Superior ocean front room. Hotel is only 10 mins away (via scooter) from Nusa Lembongan port.  Staff was kind and helpful. Room was neat and clean and AC was working awesomely in such a summer heat. The restaurant only provide the breakfast which is limited and basic but tastes good, for lunch and dinner there are many beautiful cafes nearby on beach front. I got the rented scooter from the hotel at a cheap price.
Water was very salty that i didnt take bath for 2 days, rather washed my hair and face using the water dispenser available in the room. Though problem of salty water is their in all hotels. Drinking water is good which you need to buy. 
Many shopping marts are there in a walking distance where you can get eatables and drinks at a very cheap prices.
Suggestions-
I would suggest the hotel to lighten the hotel area outside as in the evening after 6 it gets really dark.
In rooms also the lights are dim.
Over all my stay in the hotel was lovely.
Thanks"
"We loved our stay at Yogi Beach Bungalow! The bungalow was very spacious, with good air con and a fridge in the room. Breakfast was excellent. The staff were friendly and efficient. It was great to stay so close to the beach, but it is also not far to walk up to the main road where you can find shops and restaurants.  I highly recommend this place on Lembongan island!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Yogi Beach Bungalow and really couldn't have asked for more. The beachfront location is scenic and ideal, the room was clean and comfortable, the grounds are beautiful, and Yogi and his family are kind, welcoming, and helpful. Also, after traveling around Bali for ~2 weeks prior, we really welcomed the absence of noisy roosters in the early morning hours. It is extraordinarily quiet and peaceful here. We loved staying here and would have liked to stay longer if our plans had permitted it. We enthusiastically recommend Yogi Beach Bungalow, without hesitation!"
"We had a pleasant stay, Nusa Lembognan is still quite calm - no mass tourism, Yogi beach bungalow is in the middle of all facilities and there or a lot of diner options and options to book activities (also via Yogi).

The rooms are clean and good, the only somewhat negatieve aspect is a quite hard bed. The rooms have airconditioner and a vin and warm water. Despite there is no swimming pool, you can lay down on the relaxing chairs and enjoy the great view (and SUNSET!)

Yogi also arranged our transportation from the island, really convenient because there are a lot of companies with there won rules and prices

Overall a real pleasant and enjoyable stay"
"We are a young couple and stayed at Yogi for 4 nights. We absolutely loved it! Our bungalow was placed 10 m from the beach with ocean view from our bed (all bungalows are very close to the beach). Beautiful and comfortable bungalows with aircon. The small garden with many beach chairs was a perfect place to enjoy the sun during the day, and watch the sea weed farmers at sunset. The restaurant at Yogi is only open for breakfast, but plenty dinning opportunities as you stroll along the beach front. The owner helped us arrange a snorkelling trip to see the mantas; his uncle took us on a fantastic trip, nice boat, he knew just where to go, away from the many tourist boats to find a whole group of them. Don't miss this! Great snorkelling as well. Also, the owner helped us with renting a scooter to go around the island and with transportation to the Gili islands. Very open and helpful. We will definitely come back here!"
"Perfect for what we needed, the room has everything you need and is Nice and clean. Only problem was the look on the sink and shower (looks dirty and bad, but Its just because of the salt in the air, since the huts are on the beach, no problem) beautiful place on the beach to have breakfast (BTW try the orange juice, best i've ever tasted!). We had a Good stay and the staff was very helpfull with transport both around the island and with boat over too nusa lembongan which was cheaper than the other services! Try This place, Its Nice:)"
"I can highly recommend staying at Yogi Beach Bungalows.  Yogi and his young family are very hospitable, helpful and friendly.  Accommodation was presented very well, clean and tidy and was maintained daily.  Location is perfect, absolute water frontage directly in front of the surf at shipwrecks.  Breakfast was great, the beers cold and short walk required for your choice of restaurants along the beach for lunch and dinner.  
Thanks Yogi, you will see me again for sure."
We had a great time we enjoyed the peacefulness of nusa lembongan and there was plenty to do. Yogi helped us organise a snorkelling trip which wa great and really reasonable. The value for money was excellent for our entire stay. Definitely recommend it!
"We spent four nights here at Yogi Beach bungalows. Our room was upstairs facing the ocean with a big Terrace and lovely big windows.  Everyone knows how many dark rooms there are when you’re traveling and this one was filled with light.  Breakfast was yummy with a choice of fresh fruit plate or a big glass of fresh juice, choice of eggs or banana pancake. Beach right out front. Sunset every night. What’s not to love?"
"We loved our stay in Yogi bungalows. They are located right on the beach with seatings on the white sand where you can watch sunset every day. The bungalows are spacious and nice with terrace, everything was very clean. Wifi is quite good compared to other places on the island, there is hot water, minifridge, restaurant, altough they close it quite early in the evening (but there are restaurants on the beach right next door). Definitely worth staying here!"
"I really enjoyed staying here. Location was great got its own beach, sunbed and bean bags. Everyday i had breakfast by the beach even last day i was having it on my beach mat. So cool.. 
The room was spacious enough even for 2. Clean and smell good. 
Sunset view eventhough when i was there the clouds was so thick :( 
Water level of the beach was stabil. Meaning u can go swimming at anytime. Morning till after sunset. 
Must improve : 
1. Breakfast quality
2. Water for shower. They still have salty water
 
Anyway if you really wanna find relaxation and quiet. This is the place. Though u will find a good big resort and beach club up to the north and some bars very close to it.
But Lembongan is a perfect place to have ur retreat."
"Great location. Waking up in the morning with sound of waves - priceless. Good spot for beautiful sunsets. 
Amazing staff, friendly and helpful. 
Water pressure in my room not that great, but dont expect 5* facilities paying 30$ per night :-) Otherwise yogi beach bungalow met my expectation and went beyond.
I would definitely go back if I had a chance! Thank you for your warm hospitality."
"My stay at Yogi Beach Bungalow could not have been more perfect. The owner, Yogi, was always helpful and friendly, about everything from renting motorbikes to discussing the best surf spots. The rooms were clean and well taken care of, and the staff was very relaxed and helpful even when I was several hours late to check out. I will definitely stay at Yogi's again!"
"Loved my stay at Yogi Beach. Located right on the beach was able to watch the surfers out on the break and sunset and ideal spot to stay if diving with Blue Corner (50 m up the beach).The bungalow was cute and very clean and well kept, air con and hot water. Comfortable bed.  Nice and quiet, chairs were available to lounge in the sun. 
Nice, small family run accommodation. Yogi was very friendly, occasionally a bit hard to track down, but can arrange transport and activities. Breakfast was extra, but was ready for me bright and early so I could go out diving. 
Only thing missing to make it perfect is a pool. Would go back in a heart beat. Super value for money."
"I had a great stay in Yogi Bungalow, very nice & clean room with a huge window and a wonderful sea view. Garden around the bungalows is beautiful, carefully maintained. Staff is very friendly and helpful. At the time when I was staying, the resort did not offer breakfast-food, they plan it in the future.In the surroundings, during a walk along the beach there are many restaurants and bars.In any case, I had an excellent stay and I would like to return there again."
"Stayed over Yogi Beach Bungalow for 2 nights. Its situation right on the beachfront, lovely spot to watch the sunset. Just next door, you can have dinner & free wifi - Nuri Putri. If you need anything at all - Look for Jamboo, He is the go to guy there.

Overall a very comfortable stay, only wished they had internet connection. But then again, it was good not to be so connected."
"Yogi Beach was a good value place right on the beach.  Breakfast was simple but good.  Excellent location for walking to restaurants and cafes in the area.  Staff great, especially Yogi who assisted with reconfirming boat rides when the boat company phone hotline was not answered.   Room had a/c as well as a fan, which was preferable on cooler nights.  Firm but comfy bed.  Restaurant only open for breakfast but that meant the place was more relaxed around other mealtimes.  Would stay again."
Excellent family run bungalows right on the beach.  Have been to Nusa lembongan five times now and wouldn't stay anywhere else. They have made me feel like part of their family!
"Perfect location right at the beach, many great restaurants in the near (hotel has only breakfast) and they have scooters and boards for rent 👌 very nice and helpful staff. 
The breakfast is the same 2 options every day (coffee or tea/ fruit or juice / pancake or toast w eggs), gets a bit boring in a week. But that's when you can test the brekkie elsewhere 😉 I will definitely stay here again if on Lembongan! ☺️"
"Everything about Yogi beach is wonderful, the staff are so kind and friendly, the location is amazing, the rooms are everything I need. 
I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else when I come (and I've stayed here 3 times already, once for a month). 
Warm showers, comfy bed, quiet, and the sea is right on the doorstep. Its also one of my favourite places to eat in the evenings with amazing fresh fish on the grill! 
Thank you Yogi!!"
"The location is perfect, the staff are friendly and dedicated, the food with a view is great.  The rooms are simple and clean.
I'll be back and then I'll be back again!"
"I had a great stay at Yogi, the room was clean, and spacious with a large washroom and hot water. The staff were friendly and helpful. There is also a great restaurant right on site."
Amazing place to stay right at the beach for a reasonable cost.  Highly recommend!
"Love Yogi Beach, its my go to place to stay, has everything you need and is in the best location. Comfortable beds, wonderful staff and the food is great too if you want to eat there."
This place and the family who run it are wonderful x
"Definitely recommend to book this place !! The staff is amazing always smiling, the location is perfect! The rooms are cleaned and the food is good ! Just book it you will love it"
"I come here for already 2 years and love the peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. It’s situated right at the beachfront and next to my favorite coffeeshop. The staff is really friendly, everything is clean and neat. 
Some things in the room are a bit destroyed, like the tab of the shower and the sink, but everything still works. Internet wasn’t great, but that’s normal on an island for me
I Love it here!"
Great location! The rooms are basic but very clean. The views are great and the fresh fish on the bbq is pure and delicious.
We have stayed at Yogis on three separate visits to Bali. It is our favourite place to stay in Nusa Lembongan. This year we can also enjoy the Yogi
Best hash browns I have ever eaten….
"Absolutely lovvvvvvvvve this place.
Simple, clean, friendly and right on the beach.
You are lucky if you can get in!"
"We stayed with children
Beach is nearby
Good location for restaurants 
Nice staff"
Funtastic!
"Great location. Very peaceful right on the beach.  The bungalow was very clean  tidy, and quite large.  The terrace nice too. The family that runs the place are very nice, and always available. 
This place is really excellent for the price."
"If you want to stay in a concrete and marble style mausoleum and imagine what it's like to be dead for a few nights, this is the place for you! Look, I have to be fair, this has a marvelous beach side location and mot of the staff were friendly, but the manager was  surly and argumentative and generally unhelpful when we were trying to make changes to our booking. The breakfasts were OK, though limited, as were the furnishings to our room. One good thing: there is a great no-waste restaurant and set-up ca llefd Beach Hello just next door with delicious food and wonderful service . . ."
"Plain and simple breakfast, the fruit didnt taste much.
Dried out brown grass and sharpedged paved path to walk on throughout the yard.
Saltwater in the tap and shower.
One big jug of ""drinkingwater"" in the room, for how long has that been there in the heat? And also opended.. 🤔
This place is cheap and has a good beachlocation, the staff was also really nice.
Bjt the owner should do more to make the stay better."
"We enjoyed our stay. The location is good, the room and everything clean and the stafd nice. We had a very good Wifi in the room. The breakfast is good as well. Just the shower and the water is very salty, like directly from the sea water. And almost the only beach resort without a pool, but you can easily go to other pools. We would come again."
"Location looks ideal being on the ocean front but not that peaceful - packs of stray dogs - boats reeking of petrol fumes - dirty ocean - shallow and full of sharp coral - ok for a night stay - breakfast pretty blah and the coffee is horrible - many of the local resturants and cafes run by teenage boys more into their mobiles watching TV or socialising loudly with each other than serving customers. Be prepared for food poisoning and attitude when you ask for the basic service. Even the better looking places haven't a clue about hospitality or proper service. One day you think great I found great food service etc only to go back and get the complete opposite. I'm fine with going with the flow and giving the balinese allowances because they are not really worldly but I'm really over the low quality standards If tourism supports the country then step up Bali and learn beyond your own culture bubble 
There is no actual Lembongan Restaurant they only do really bad breakfasts"
"We loved our stay here! 
The staff was super friendly, they always helped where they could :)
Breakfast was basic but very yummy. They also rent out nice scooters for a fair price. 
But of course the greatest thing was the location right at the beach :) Would always go back here!"
Great location on the beach. White sand clean water and surfing point. It’s north part of the island. Near the pier. Far from the view point but you can rent a motorbike on the street.
"Great place to stay, away from hussle & bustle, but close enough to walk to supermarket, lots of eating options. Beach frontage with grass area for relaxing. Staff very friendly & helpful for arranging all travel, sightseeing requirements. We'll be back"
"Located right on the beach this is a great location to sit and watch all the beach activity while you read or simply relax. The breakfast was simple, but great. There are many great beach restaurants for lunch and dinner a short walk up the beach. A pool would have been nice as swing at the beach is not possible during low tide.  We would stay here again."
Right on the beach. Beautiful. Very clean and spacious. Only recommendations would be to have some more beach/lounge chairs and put a hot water kettle in each room. Needed for us who need coffee ASAP in the morning. Overall great stay!
"Perfect location. Peaceful beach. Great staff. Clean rooms. Will definitely stay again. 
Only recommendation would be for a hot water kettle to be in each room."
Great location in front of the ocean...too bad there are rocks in it but the water and sand is amazing. Breakfast can improve.
On the beachfront a quiet place with fantastic sunsets views.  surrounded by restaurants on the beach where you can eat healthy and great.
"Everything I read from the reviews of earlier travellers before I stayed in Yogi were true.. I had the best Bungalow which was just next to to beach & waking up each day to the lovely sea view next to my bed is simply amazing 😱 
There’s but one thing which can be improved ie the hot water is rather intermittent when showering & if this can be improved, it’s awesome 🤟"
"The bungalows are just in the beach, you can enjoy the sea from the premise itself. They give breakfast also at a very affordable rate. Btw, hotels like this and others in this area are far from the port beside yellow bridge so you need to hire taxi to go and come back. But if you want peaceful environment this the right choice."
"Perfect location, spotlessly clean and good amenities. Would definitely stay again."
"Really clean, perfect location, free breakfast and comfortable accommodation. My only gripe would be that the hot water isn't very reliable so you may have to take a cold shower but apart from that, I enjoyed my stay so much that I extended for 2 more days."
"Great location direct on the beach in front of the surfspots.
We would book it again and enjoyed our time here to the fullest."
"Best value for money location in Lembongan, we love Yogis and always stay here as we love this area of the island."
"Pros:
-ON THE BEACH!
-clean, nice rooms
Cons: on Agoda the price we paid was different than they typically charge, we paid about $18 for one night and we wanted to extend for another night but they wanted $26 instead and claimed the room would never cost $18 so they didn't allow us to extend even though the place EMPTY!"
"I’ve now stayed here at least 10 times and wouldn’t stay anywhere else, it’s fantastic! Bungalows right on the beach in a great location. very clean and comfortable, and the staff and management are very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommend!"
"Great location, right on the beach, a quiet place, great restaurants on the beach, walk north or south a few minutes and you will pass several. No pool, but if you buy a drink or a meal at any of the other places they will let you use theirs. Breakfast is basic but satisfying. Ice cold air and a few rooms have mini- fridge.  Only saltwater on the bathroom.  We stayed at another nearby hotel and came back to Yogi for 3 more nights. We will be back."
"Right on the beach with seaviews from pretty much all bungalows. Peaceful and quiet at night falling asleep with the sounds of the waves. On the less busy part of the beach. Good yogacenter nearby. 
The only negative thing was that my shower and bathroom sink tabs were passed their days and while showering it smelled so bad I pretty much avoided having showers. Talked with the staff about replacing them, so hopefully they will!"
"We had a great time! 
The Bungalow was big, the restroom very cleen, but the shower and the tap were with ocean water.
The Breakfast was great. The stuff were friendly and you could book almost evreything there ;-) 
Lembogan is a small island with a scooter you cab discover everything and it is totaly worth to go to nusa ceningan!"
Lovely stay here right on the beach!
in the beach and facing the sunset. I definitely will go back.
"Booked 2 Bungalows - 12 room nights in total.  Booked 22 April - I thought for 24/30 May but I had selected 24/30 April accidentally.  Contacted Agoda on 24 April when it showed on my calendar where was supposed to be. They tried the property twice to see if we could correct the dates to one month later and I was happy to
Pay at least the first nights accommodation charges on both rooms however as per the cancellation clause absolutely no refund ..... I thought that poor of the property, ruthless and greedy in fact. There were 2 rooms for six nights and they were not full over those dates so keeping all of the payment was very excessive.  Needless to say am staying away from these guys in May! First time such a bad experience and not at all what I'd expect from what I thought was a lovely place to visit and a nice place and people to stay with...... not so."
"In my booking was the breakfast included but is really bad breakfast. Only 2 slids of toast and eggs without nothing. The plates of fruchts was dry and not good.
If you ask more toast or coffee they will charge you. Is just ridiculous for this bad breakfast.
The room is big but nothing els and the shower not working really well. 
The beach is dirty and not nice. Don't think that you have great time on the beach. There are algues and a lot of plastic every where but in this hotel they are no swimming pool.
The staff is helpful and nice."
"Basic hotel, but it was friendly staff and decent location. They had really bad wifi and salt water from the tap, but otherwise it was good."
"Air conditioning worked well, value for money, rooms were clean. However, water in the tap was slightly salty"
"Perfect location, nice and clean room, great team!"
The staff was kind and engaging. I felt like they genuinely cared. They offered many services to help me keep busy on the island. 11 out of 10. I will come back again!
"Room is big and great bed. Bungalow right on the beach. But restaurant is closed. Have to go elsewhere to eat other than breakfast. 
Staff is nice.   There is no seating on the beach as shown in the picture. 
Salt water shower. No hot water or No shampoo provided."
Very nice and very clean bedrooms. Beautifully kept little garden :)  Location is amazing. A very good price.  My friends were staying next door and didn't have half of the facilities we had and had to pay one third more than what we paid. We'll come back!

"Best part of the beach - a couple of 'resorts' further south, and the crowds begin.  Yogi is great.  Either side of Yogi's you'll find a great little Warung on the sand, with no crowd."
the water was too salty that we had to buy mineral water to wash face. the staff were not available easily on the reception. the staff were not so helpful.
"Very large rooms! Great A/C. Located right on the beach. Amazing food available on the beach front. Breakfast is limited but tasty. The only negative is you can hear everything from the room above. We were both woken up at night when the above guests were coming home late. This might not bother some people, but it was like they were in the room with us! The cheap price & location make up for it though."
"Neat clean tidy organized venue peace quiet,  views, obliging staff."
"Fabulous location, good breakfast although limited choices, friendly helpful staff. Only down thing was having salt water showers. Air con & wifi great. Right on the beach front, lots of different eating places to try.  Motor scooters to rent good rate."
"We stayed in the ocean front bungalow. The view was amazing, the room was comfortable and clean. The only thing we didn't liked  was the bathroom. Mold on the ceiling and the sink and shower was covered in rust because they use saltwater. Great value for money. Perfect location to see the sunset."
It will nice if there was extension cords to be able to charge both phone and use the night light
"They have friendly  staff who offer advice if asked . They offer scooter rentals and surfboard rentals too. It’s a family owned business and I know what to expect each visit. I stayed here last year for four days and was so impressed that I returned this year for four days also . The rooms are very quiet and the air conditioning works well . The WiFi is included and works throughout the resort. A simple but nice breakfast is included in the room charge. Both visits I choose to upgrade really omg to get room number 108 . It’s upstairs and offer a view of the surf break from inside the room . The rooms also have a patio with two chairs and a table to relax outside . This resort is far enough way from the hustle and bustle zone where the boats are picking up and dropping off visitors hourly. You can watch the sunset from the balcony in room #108 , it’s worth the 100k Rupiah upgrade fee . The only thing that I think of that could be improved on is : offer hot showers ."
"amazing - can’t recommend enough! Best location on Nusa Lembongan. Right on the beach, beautiful clean room and grounds. Can’t wait to go back!"
Beautiful room with ocean view. The bungalows are right in the beach
"Fantastic family run hotel, right on the beach.  There are 5 bungalows and a block of 4 rooms, all looking out to a lovely garden setting and most have sea views.  The rooms are very clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  I've stayed here 4 times now and can't wait to return again.  Highly recommend."
"Yogi BB is a great place if you want simple. The staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. It's generally very quiet there and they don't play horrible music all day like most places on the island! There's plenty of places to eat nearby. There's no hot water though and it's salt water.   WiFi can be spotty at times but will work for emails well, but not streaming. Overall, the price is great and the staff is great. Good value."
"Staff very friendly, nice breakfast. Needs a lit bit more attention to clean. Water from tap and shower was salty . 
Other than that it was great value."
"Very easy to get to once you leave the harbour. Breakfast is included and is reasonable. Excellent value to money since it is along the beach however there are many boats also in your way. 
I would recommend and stay again. Staff were efficient but only one was very friendly at first."
"I really loved the hut and the location is beautiful.  I didn’t like the service much -not that the staff was rude, he was actually very nice...but half the time he wasn’t at the front desk.  Also I HATED the fact that I had to check out at 10am.  Ridiculous!  Who wants to rush out early in the am?  No late check out and the breakfast menu sucked."
We were there for a diving course that was just a two minute walk away. The people were great.  The rooms are clean - only downside is that the shower water is sea water ( we prefer fresh water).
"Great times traveling solo, breakfast was included. I recommend it for anyone who wants to disconnect or simply wants to hang out near by.  The restaurants on each side in front of the beach are also good. I would suggest to management having beach towels and changing the beach chairs cushions, they are in bad shape. Beach umbrellas would be a plus. Overall I loved it."
