Column 1
very very good
"Reasonable price, clean and feels like home"
right in the middle of raya kuta so you wont go hungry here.
Sikat gigi tdk disediakan. So faar semua okay
"Staff helpful, gak usah pesan yg included breakfast"
If shopping for local oleh oleh and leaving for airport! Very strategic.nice staff
The hotel is very old and rooms are very small. You must be careful when you move around inside the room because you may easily bump here and there due to the very small space of the room. You need to request the front desk for the basic amenities like a hairdryer and kettle.
"Decent room for a very affordable rate during weekend. Downside: traffic right in front of the hotel, limited parking space.
Got room 502, with view of the front street, yet I can't hardly connect to wifi. Good thing they have plentiful choice of TV cable."
"I stayed there for one night, staff were so nice, good location, 1 km away from Kuta Beach."
The location is surrounded by so many food and gift shopping spots. it only takes few minutes to Ngurah Rai airport.
"No toothpaste n brush at the bathroom, what a pity cz they r the most essential parts in a hotel. Food wasn't really good also."
"Satisfied. Very clean, helpfull receptionist staff, have 24 hours mini market in lobby, great spa in 2nd floor, 5-10 minute from beach n shopping centre kuta using taxi, 3 minute walking for eating nasi pedes ibu andika also 3 minute walking to buy Bali funny wording sovenir ""Joger"". Definitely worth it to stay! 
Just the marketing or sales banguet manager not easy to meet while i'm going to have an event on may'14 only with 75 room, ask me to visit in blambangan road their office while I'm staying in their hotel seminyak and kuta lol... what a service?! Luckly the rest of the staff really excelent service."
"""Luxury feeling, budget price"" =) Almost true! Looks like the hotel is brand new
The room was small but cozy, the bed was very comfortable
The hotel is located at Raya Kuta rd, its very busy and a motorbike or car is a must.
There is a construction near, they start drilling at ~10am and my room was very noisy at daytime.
There are several others Grandmas hotels, they look the same and I think the location of Grandmas Legian is the best one. 
Highly recommended
Check-in at 14PM, quite late."
The staff were very helpful to track my bag that I left behind in taxi before I checked in . They were supportive and solve issue. J hotel is five star hotel in terms of service. J hotel is highly recommended
"The only real downside to this hotel is that on the booking form it says the same address for two if the grandmas hotels in kuta, we were booked into one where are friends were in another, staff said they couldn't fix this so we ended up paying for a one room in one hotel we weren't staying and one in this one! But that was our personal experience, other than that the room was perfect, beds were really comfy and the bathroom was lovely and well designed, would recommend this hotel"
"Grandmas Kuta is always be my choice for staying @ Bali
It's near to Airport and Kuta Beach if you rent a car or motorcycle.
Easy to find good restaurant with reasonable price.
Room and bathroom are small, but comfy and clean.
A bit noisy due to the next construction site and sleepless road.
But overall it's a great value."
"In comparison to most budget hotel chain, GRANDMAS branding is good. If you are similar with Bali & is a good navigator, this Grandmas Kuta deal is acceptable. Slow walk takes about 20mins to HardRock Bali hotel passing by mostly the city shopping & eateries around the beach front.
Just turning left of the hotel, if you are into spicy Indonesian dishes stopping by NASI PEDES IBU ANDIKA is a must! Opposite, you can pick up some nice T-shirt from the famous local born artist JOGER.
On the right of the hotel, further walk for 10 min would landed you with a several nice restaurants(popular Chinese cuisine with the local). We have dinner there & the prices are acceptable.
Hotel Superior Mr. Hatta was helpful in resolving our email print out due to last minute travel plan changes.
Breakfast is ok. Additional choice of dishes will be much appreciated.
E-mail in the room is not so ""strong"" & interrupt with connection occasionally. I prefer to log in at the lobby PC which is the best place to be !
Overall good!"
"This is the first time we stay in this hotel, local brand and suprisingly it's very clean, tidy and good atmosphere. Everywhere is local indonesia food available and everyday you can choose different kind. Not far from the hotel, there is Joger, a must place to visit to buy ""oleh-oleh"" or gift from Bali, selection from Balinese Wood carving until Balinese type of shirt with funny words printed."
"I like the hotel because it is very near the airport, malls (city) and food. I like the hotel because it has friendly, smiling, helpful staff. This is very important at the arrival at the hotel on day-1. Further, the room is clean and the aircon is cold, which is necessary when you want to feel comfortable. The food for breakfast is ok. Not many choices but delicious. What I did not like was the price that I got from agoda, which was more expensive than the walk-in rate. There was a difference of IDR 60,000 (equivalent to approx. US$ 45. I would not mind going back there for short stays in Bali."
"It's a new hotel, some paving block in the parking area still not finished.
The room is clean, even though a bit small.
Next to the building, there's some new hotel in construction, so sometimes a bit noisy.
But for the price i paid, it's very good value.
Near to Khrisna, Joger, Warung Nasi Ibu Andhika, Laota, and other good restaurants."
at first time to come this hotel i'm having difficulties to find the way to hotel even thought using gps but it gave me incorrect location thanks guided from grandmas operator and local peoples in bali. They are very friendly. I love to come again to bali. the room small but comfortable.overall I've stayed in hotel was good and easy. thanks Grandmas Kuta hotel
we stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. this is a very nice hotel with affordable price..  the room is very clean and well designed.. nothing to complaint about.. for the next visit to bali we will spend our nights in this hotel again... keep up the good service and the nice affordable pricing
Very recommended for everyone. Near a lot of tourism spots. Around 15 minutes from airport and 5 minutes from kuta beach. Lots of restaurant nearby. Very active nightlife too. Just need improvement for breakfast and this hotel will be perfect for traveler.
"We book our own tour guide so location near to kuta city wasn't a problem for us, this hotel is very cheap and the room is new n big. Will come back here again if we visit Bali again"
"This hotel is nice hotel with cozy room,comfortable bed and friendly staffs.
From this hotel is very easy to go to Jogger, Krisna shops, local restaurants are plenty near by this hotel. In front of this hotel there is Restaurant Ayam Pelengkung, in the evening they have nice music and singer.Over all, I really like staying in this hotel and would like to recomend to friends to stay in this hotel when they come to Bali."
The Grandmas Kuta Hotel is very nice. the location is very close to the beach. and very good night life. the hotel is not very expensive.
"The location of the hotel is very strategic, its close to many bali attraction, and many good food around as well (dont count on the hotel food)
for the price of around 30USD, and with good internet connection as well, grand mas kuta is totally worth every penny"
"Thank you Grandmas hotel, I do have great time at Kuta Bali."
"I enjoyed my solo stay and having a very good rest on the room. Very suitable for adventurer that need low budget hotel, but honestly speaking the hotel is equipped with sophisticated touch screen elevator and high end proximity door lock. In-room safety box and LED tv enriched guests convenience. Some more, on the lobby, got convenient store inside that help small need fot guests. This is a highly recommended hotel for everybody."
One of the best hotels I stayed in Bali. The staffs are very friendly and the room is clean. They got good local breakfast and I will go back again .
"Overall is good. Helpful staff, clean, and good wifi connection. Just the hotel bit far from kuta attractions. it took us about 20 minutes walk to kuta beach. The breakfast provided not nice."
"The hotel is very modern and comfortable, it is close to the shopping and restaurant areas of kuta and not too far to the beach, the staff are very friendly and accommodating"
"Very good Hotel.
Im from germany and slept here multiple Nights!
Dankeschön und gerne wieder!👍😀"
Need to improve more the value of property of this hotel
Good
Good hotel and cozy
Clean and comfort
Location good for walking around to get culinary
Easy to reach food arround the hotel and not far from Kuta area
Location good and clean
best
Small simple room. Affordable and close to local food places and airport. The only negatives are it is frequented with group so it gets noisy.
So far so good
Good
Good
"I stayed there for 4 nights.Their wifi doesnt work at all i tried changing my room too but then gave up.I was there for meetings and suffered big problems due to this.They have absolutely nothing in breakfast.I repeat absolutely nothing.Everyday you go they offer you rice and s
2 small pieces of chicken with sauce.Is that a breakfast ppl expect.Ok we are paying less but at the end of the day you expect few things from the property too.Not recomended at all!!Will never book it in the future.."
"Pros : Cheap, clean, friendly staff, close to airport and near to many cheap halal restaurant
Cons : Since they are using underground water, the first few minutes the water might be smelly but after a while it's all good"
Nice hotel in Kuta.
We stayed one night. The only issue we had was that the shower flooded and would not drain well. The hotel beds are comfy.
"i called before to make sure my reservation is there right after i booked it (he said he didnt have it but maybe it will come later so i ended the conversation), then when i come he told me he didnt have my reservation and i showed my booking. the thing is he told me the room is full and they didnt receive my booking. ok cool. i showed my booking confirmation already so please do something useful. finally when my friend was a bit mad at the front desk he started making action and gave u the key to the room. it is weird cause he told me that the room was full at first. why making our life difficult from the beginning if you actually have the room and i have the voucher. seriously"
"The location is nearby the airport and a lot amenities nearby like minimart and restaurant. The breakfast option is not so many, they don't have egg station you need to pay around 50 cent if you want egg.  The room is small. just enough for a bed."
"really old ...shows in room . tiny basin sink. No cable tv in the room only in reception area. Staff no english.  Strange old banged up cupboard and weird mirror on wall in front of tiny tv.  Bed squashed into corner of room and blocking power outlet. 
 Towel is big 3 stains unacceptable should have been thrown in garbage 5 years ago. 
 Only good thing was the refund was given. We went to kuta and got a proper hotel for 30k less with brand new toilet and shower 2 towels and soap provided."
"this hotel need to change the towel and linen bed and all the rack inside the hotel room, my room was broken, and when im check in the hot water can not use"
lots of ants in the room
All good
"First time visit after new hotel management took over. New look for entrance of the hotel and restaurant but in the room no changes. Even worst no amenities in the bathroom. Need replacement for linen and towel, and TV."
It's a very good location since we need to walk for a while everyday.
"WE STAYED HERE FOR A TRANSIT BEFORE TRANSFERRING TO ANOTHER HOTEL. NICE HOTEL FOR ITS BUDGET, NEAR FROM LOTS OF RESTAURANTS, NICE LITTLE BREAKFAST, VERY HELPFUL AND KIND STAFF. THE ONLY THING NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED: WIFI ACCESS IS TOO SLOW IN THE ROOM. #517"
"PROS cheap, close to airport, friendly staff, clean modern rooms.
CONS so cheap Indonesians stay there, unfortunately they are not curious, yelling during conversations in corridors.
If it's only for a night and you can tolerate the noise or have a early morning flight then this hotel is for you."
"Pros - Great hotel fantastic prices particularly for budget travellers or people wanting something close to the airport.
Cons - Cheap so Indonesians stay their, but they have no regards for follow quests with shouting in the corridors in early hours of the morning and very loud conversations."
"Very good hotel with goos location,clean hotel and best price"
"Nice room and nice everthing, but need to improve hot water please state on each level, not go to reception to take hot water. Thank you."
dun expect to much... just enjoy simplicity for this value for money room...
3 floor  no wifi ..serivce is good .
the room is okay and clean. great value for budget traveller. the location is near airport and shopping area ( joger/krisna).
"Staff is very friendly and nice people.
One missing thing is swimming pool."
They changed our booking room to another far hotel with reason of bathroom leaking water. They have same reason to other due to the late check in person. So that can sell our room in higher rate to other people who need when walk in. I face the same problem and even same reason in another booking in Bali Ubud. DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
"Nice place and nice staff
Bed sheets were smelling a little moisture."
The bedsheets is dirty and so itchy
good
"U pay what u get. comfortable bed, friendly staff."
"We got a very good deal for our adjoining rooms (no connecting door, but side-to-side rooms) as 4D3N stay. Superb breakfast from Mangis Resto and great location with tons of good foods around (Nasi Pedas Bu Andika, New Plengkung, Ayam Guling Ning Nong.)
Definitely worth the money!"
very stamdart hotel
"place is nice, clean, and cozy....love it"
Only 10 minute to airport ..  staff ok .. location ok
Ok
"As always, nice stay."
"Clean room, good location."
overall ok
the was so small even the bathroom.. but it was nice..
No comment
"i cant refund my hotel,"
Good hotel and good location
"The staff were more than friendly, they even opened and closed the car door for me. Clean, I was happy."
very nice hotel and service was excellent
good location - clean room - comfortable room
Good
"It was the second time, I chose to stay there before the name was changed. The first was okay, but the second wasn't. 
When I came, the receptionists were kind, but there was no bellboy, so the security helped me to bring my bags. 
On the room, the floor was so dirty with some stain on it and the air was awful. 
There were so many stain on the pillow and it looked it wasn't changed with the new one.
For the breakfast, before the end of the time, it run out of food and it didn't fill again. It should count how many people will eat. Thx"
"Very easy to find food. Easy to excess, near to the airport."
thanks thanks thanks
"near druf store 24 hour ,and good location for shooping and good room"
Nice
"Noisy hotel full of tourists, breakfast refill with low quality food, tasteless coffee and dirty fruits."
"good location, nice staff, good room"
The hotel location is close by airport but not so in the center of hip areas I.e. seminyak. But for anyone whose traveling with tour busses and rent car is quite convenient. With good deal and clean I say book now !
OK
Average
Nice
Clean room although room space is to tight. Breakfast for me just to plain for three star hotels. Overall good budget hotel meet a 3 star rating standard.
My brother always stay here when he visited Bali. This is first time with his wife.
it was good
Enjoy my holiday 😆
"Very pleasant, near every thing  including the beach lovely and clean"
Nightmare. never return.
"I had the worst breakfast ever. The coffee was bad, too much water, so its juices.
The bathroom was dirty, the towel even more. The hot water was dis-function.
I don't even think to re-book this hotel again."
"I have always stay in Grandmas whenever I have a stopover in Bali to make. It has been nothing but pleasant and comfortable. The room is cozy, a little small, but since i am always solo traveling this has never been a problem."
"it is a good 3 star hotel, been frequently stay at this hotel. recommended if you don't look for big room but affordable and good stay to spend the night"
"The room was clean, recomended"
It was a pleasant stay.
pleasant
"Very disappointing even for budget hotel. Bedding was not clean, food low quality and staff attitude very poor.  The bathroom smelled.   I won't be staying here again."
It was truly memorable
"The main issue that we ran into with Grandmas Kuta is that none of the taxi drivers knew where it was or that it existed.  We may have just had bad luck, but for sure its clear that even the taxi drivers that are aware of it don't want to go there because its far out and hard for them to get a return fare.  You'll get charged a lot if your coming from the beach or Jalan Legian.  It's better to just walk.  Other than that the only reason to stay here is the other Grandmas were completely booked."
My wife and i thourghly enjoyed our three day stay at grandmas .thank you.
