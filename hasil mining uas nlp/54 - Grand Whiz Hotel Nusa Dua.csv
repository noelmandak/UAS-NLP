"We travelled as a couple and stayed in Grand Whiz for 5 nights and it was a memorable and enjoyable stay. Very accomodating staff always ready to help and to give their happy faces. They keep the room clean everyday. Very near the beach, pool is not crowded and we loved the breakfast buffet with enough choices. I can't get enough of their lemon iced tea. Spa is also amazing. We will definitely be back. Their staff is just the best."
Hotel is located at nusa dua. Very safe as there are securities looking after the area. You can rent bicycle from the hotel and cycle around the scenic beach area. Pool is huge and super clean. Staff are polite and helpful. Will definitely consider this hotel again. Thanks for the warm hospitality! 😊
Awesome location. Just stay here for 10x less than all the surrounding hotels and then walk next door and use the other facilities like pools and restaurants. Hahaha. Perfect man. I saved hundreds!
"The Grand Whiz offers the ultimate Nusa Dua experience, with excellent staff to assist your every need, a superb pool to relish in and a bang for your buck compared to the other pricey hotels next door."
"Room size was small, a private beach 100m from hotel, breakfast was good, nice and helpfull staff, bike rent just only 50k for 2 hr (enough for small trip around ITDC area), cheap price in room dining/restaurant..love it"
"Room is clean and cozy, but if it is raining , need efforts to go to our room"
"Great as always.Comfortable, lovely staff and great breakfast."
"It's very close to Nusa Dua beach,  where I can surf with less crowds. A private beach is behind the hotel, very nice view for the sunrise. Beach walk is awesome. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Room is clean with all the facilities I need. Balcony,  garden and swimming are all nice. The food in the restaurant is nice too with a reasonable price."
everything was great. actually this is the cheapest hotel in Nusa Dua area 🤣
"The room is not so big, but its comfortable. Swimming pool area is very nice. This hotel is Only 50 meters from Nusa dua beach. We can swim at Sofitel private beach."
"flight delay made us arrived late & tired at 10pm,
but the receptionist was so kind, they gave us a room on 2nd floor inside the semi villa style complex.
+ the room is cleaan, no weird odor at all,
 wooden ceramic style floor is clean & not sticky
+ spacious room , with relaxing porch
+ quiet & peaceful
+ breakfast was good w/ various menu everyday + indomie station  :)
+ supacool aircon
- water heater in our room didn't work well
- no shower caddy
maybe this one has the most competitive rate around fancy itdc"
Great  staff! Close to the public  beach. Clean rooms.
Very good and convenient for surfing
"I stayed 3 nights in Grand Whiz Hotel Nusa Dua. The only problem was the internet connection, which was not stable. Many times I could not connect to the  wi-fi because there was no connection. I called the operator, they fixed the problem, then after 30 minutes the internet connection lost again.
Varieties of food in the morning could be improved. For 3 days I saw the real same food.
Overall, it is a good and recommended hotel."
"The staff are very accommodating, helpful, and polite. They have their own private beach. The whole place is very clean. The pool is so nice. The food is affordable and delicious."
"Grand Whiz was great value for money. 5 minute walk to beach and even shorter walk to warungs and convenience stores. Staff were delightful and when I expressed disappointment at checkin, that our room had no balcony, we were upgraded to a pool access room which was excellent.  
Highly recommended."
"Friendly staff, very nice restaurant, everything at good price."
"Good location, 3 minutes to the beach, good promotion food"
It is good value for money and Nusa Dua is super cool
"Very good quality/price, new manager young and big professional"
Old hotel but clean. Thanks Grand Whiz!
"Thank u, Grand Whizz Nusa Dua.."
"We stayed for 2 nights and it was pretty comfortable. The breakfast buffet could be better but it wasn't that bad. At the time of our stay, the shuttle to the  beach wasn't available and we couldn't really understand why but the walk wasn't too far so we didn't mind. That said they need to put clear signs on which area is Grand Whiz by the beach as you could spend a considerable time searching for it and end up using other hotel's sunbeds which isn't the practice."
good place..good location..nice food
Nice and peacefully location .
"I stayed on this hotel for 5 days. The breakfast a bit boring, but they have various menu but almost same variant on everyday. The cleanlines just okay, but i found dead cockroach under umbrella stand. But actually the most situation i concerned when one of the houskeeping, enter my room even though its been cleaned. On of my sister caught him. Already report to the hotel about this situation, but until i checked out they didnt updated me about it. But overall, my experience when i stayed here is just okay"
Thanks for hospitality...
"Let go of this booking due to pandemic. Even though we changed our dates, but still not able to travel"
Good location and price for Nusa Dua area in Bali.
"Place is clean and rooms spacious.  Staff are welcoming and really helpful. Hotel allowed us to check in early and gave us a complimentary upgrade. Given its prime  location , hotel rate is a steal!"
Sayang kamar Dapet đi uiung so far ok deh
Good accommodation with reasonable price
"Spacious room, okay bfast, ample facilities - but the check in process could've been a lot faster and smoother. Overall it was a pleasant stay."
"Basic but nice and cheap for nusua dua. 
There is a path to the beach"
Best price in the middle of nice area in Bali
Good location and affordable price
"Overall it was a nice stay, as the staff was kind and the area is quiet as we like it.
Just we noticed, that not all is back to normal. For example the Spa is still closed and the choices at breakfast is not as good as a few years ago, but for a few days its ok.
The pool is very nice and we liked it a lot.
Regarding the Spa it could be good to make cooperation with nearby Spa, to make it easier for the guests.
Overall we can recommend this Hotel and probably will stay there again."
"Within walking distance of the major convention centres. Also 5min by car to the nearest hospital BIMC where you can get PCR testing done.
Quite far from the main tourist spots like kuta or seminyak ~45min drive"
"Is nice quiet place, but beach not the best."
"The hotel was not bad consider the price. It’s near to the beach, a bit old but clean, staff were kind, wifi was good enough to have online meetings. 
I got mosquitoes bites in the room over the stay."
"The resort was good for a few nights, the pool was nice, the room was a little musty, the breakfast had a good selection and the staff were friendly"
"Ac got problem, but the staff was giving us free upgrade to better room."
"The room was not throughly cleaned. There counter where the hotel's collaterals (room service menu) was still sticky under the brochures. But the general vibe was peaceful. There was also an Alfamart (convenience store) nearby (only 5min walk), and easy access to the Manarai Beach Club."
"Vhhbbnkkl
.."
Good to enjoy
"We got a good special price when we booked
this hotel....good value for money....location
is good...Nusa Dua is pretty quiet"
"We got it in sale price so it was cheap...we enjoyed the service
and the location is good"
As the title suggests
"The hotel complex is quite big and open space, however it can be quite dark at night. 
Was placed in a room at the second floor (no elevator), not an issue if your luggage is not heavy. 
For some reasons, there were lots of ants (both little black ones and the big red ones). 
Asked for another room, they upgraded me to a bigger one. AC is cold, bathroom is clean, but overall lighting is a bit dim to dark (not much light in the bathroom)"
Staff were very good. Load of washing came back & half of it was still damp. Buffet breakfast  was mostly cold. Egg station was good.
"Grand Whiz is located inside the ITDC Nusa Dua, compared to others hotel within the area, Grand Whiz offers an affordable price. Clean room, friendly staff but not quite flexible in term of late check out. They don't have direct access to beach but if you want to go to the beach it is located approx 300m (5mins walk)"
Locate at luxury hotels area
"Certain staff not courteous.
Room too dim. 
No international plug point or adapter in room. Plug point at working station was loose. 
Water tap is badly stained. 
Booked for family, upon check out, we were told all the face towel couldn't be found. When we went for checking in the presence of the house keeping staff, managed to locate 2 face towel, however, 2 face towels were still missing. 
Terrible experience. This incident has never happened in all my previous travels."
"An overall excellent place to stay in Nusa Dua!
The bed was so comfortable, the hot water works, the TV works too with many channels, the wifi was also fast and worked inside the room. 
The pool was very nice - of the best even! It was almost 1km! It was really big and you can swim there all night long!
The breakfast buffet was good! Waffles, pancakes, rice, chicken or fish sometimes, sausages, noodles, fruits, beans, vegetables, and a variety of bread, and a variety of desserts.
The ala-carte of the Grand Whiz's restaurant was very good; Especially their Grand Whiz burger, beats even the ones in the Bali Collection Mall! Their burger was so good! Had pickles and other stuff I don't even know in it that was really good. 
Their roasted beef with hashbrowns was also very good! 
The hotel wasn't also very far from the Bali Collection mall: Around 15-30 minutes by walking, and to the beach, (Even though it's not beach front, the Grand Whiz has a portion of the beach dedicated to it), it's around 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel. 
There were also plenty of parking spaces available should you have a car.
The staff were very pleasant, and very nice. 
Would overall recommend this place and won't mind staying here again in the future!"
"This is one of many hotels in Bali that I can say... YES...!! THIS IS IT...!!
Located in the luxurious area of Nusa Dua Beach complex, side by side with other higher start rating and branded hotels but Grand Whiz is cheap for this area.
I booked a Superior Room, the size is so nice, just perfect... bathroom and shower is very nice and clean.
Although Grand Whiz does not own its own beach space, but all guests have access to that sweet and beautiful Nusa Dua Beach... I enjoyed my afternoon and morning run in the area.
Breakfast is so so... as a four star I wish they could offer more varieties, but no complain on this for me... I enjoyed it quite well.
This hotel will be my first choice everytime I go to Bali now....!!"
"Rooms are clean and are given the once over daily.Pool is 100 meters long, great if you are an Aussie and can swim!Breakfast is fresh and has an abundance of food of many different origins. This resort is only one year old and is neat and tidy and fresh.It is smack in the middle of the gated section of Nusa Dua so is civilized and safe. Great value for money with lovely garden surrounds and not too many gusts at 130 odd rooms compared to the Mulia or Westin at 1000 plus rooms each!Remember you are in Bali expect some things to take longer, chill out and relax and you will love the GRAND WHIZ!"
"We would like to thank the staff at Grand Whiz Hotel for their hospitality, attention to detail and warm welcome to us! We were on the second leg of our Anniversary trip and chose to stay at Grand Whiz due to its proximity to the BNDCC, Bali Collection and other nice restaurants. The staff surprised us with a cake; four of them came to our room to personally greet us! It was such a lovely gesture. 
Cleanliness: we love how the room looked and felt clean and spacious! They also upgraded us for free! Our room had a good view of the pool. 
Food: We have frequently used the  in room dining service which was good. Carbonara was yummy and so are their fresh juices! If you're thinking of having a big brekky, order the American breakfast which comes with toasts, bacon, eggs and fresh fruit platter. 
Location: I also attended a conference during our stay so it was very convenient to only walk for 7 mins to the Convention Centre; it was fairly safe to walk around!"
We really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Whiz Hotel Nusa Dua. Staff were amazing & went out of their way to help us & to make our stay very enjoyable. Thank you so much!!! Our room was nice.  We loved to pool.  Breakfast was very good.  Food at restaurant/bar was good but a little pricey.  We will rebook again & looking forward to returning soon.
"We stayed at the grand whiz for 10 days. We loved it so much. It’s located in the exclusive Nusa Dua area.  It has beautiful pool, and minutes walking to the beach. Rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Restaurant is reasonably priced and the food is delicious. Definitely will visit again."
"Staying in a luxurious and relaxing complex like Nusa Dua in Bali does not always mean it comes at an expensive price. Grand Whiz is a beautiful hotel in Nusa Dua which came at a bargain! There are plenty of room size to choose from (including pool front room with direct access to the pool), a nice long swimming pool to relax, and a nice comfortable bed. Breakfast selection could be better as it was slightly tasteless. Other than that, i have no complains. I get more than what i expected here.
Don't forget to ask for the room with direct access to the pool! you have to pay a little bit more, but it is very nice to have the flexibility to just jump in the pool whevener you feel like doing it."
"Booked this hotel because of the location and positive reviews. Thought  at that time, I believed, the Hotel is directly on Nusa Dua Beach, but that appeared to be wrong. 
It's a 350 m walk in between club med and Sofitel to reach to the nusa dua beach. There the hotel has 14 beach chairs with sunshades. That does not sound a lot, but they where never fully occupied. The location is just great. There are no public toilets around, so if that call is coming, you have to go the distance.
The room is super clean, every day they are doing the same routine to keep it that way.  The see-through bathroom window, has a roll down curtain, the wash base has ample of space for huge family utilities. 
My room had a balcony with 2 chairs, a table and a garden view, because of the wall on both sides, it felt very much private.
The food was good, but I had only the vegetarian options, so I can't say nothing about the others. I enjoyed that freshly baked bread every morning, the gray one being #1"
Grand Whiz Hotel is in South Kuta (Nusa Dua) next to Softel and a small walk to the private beach.  The whole area is basically 5-star hotel properties with their own mall (free shuttle) - cool!  This is where you go to relax and stay away from the crowds.
"Was very happy with our stay here, it was one of the cheapest in the area with a pool and near the beach etc, but great value for money. Only 6 years old and shows as still well maintained, everything worked well looked after. The rooms large with good size bathroom. Hot water and aircon worked well. WiFi worked good too. All Staff very friendly and helpful, even if not their job they would help you or go find someone to help. They are always cleaning and looking after public areas and housekeep does your room everyday unless you have the don’t disturb sign on. It’s only 2 mins walk to the beach and they have a few beach chairs for guest down there. Restaurant did some good deals on certain days with bbq buffet etc which we enjoyed and a good price for Nusa! Just outside the big entrance gate when you first arrive (2 mins walk from hotel) is lots of cheap food places to eat and shops to buy cheap water etc. Same with the other entrance of the whole complex. They also have a regular free shuttle (red bus) that takes you down to the bail collection which has food and shops. There is a timetable in reception. There is also free brown bus that drives around the area and will drop you off at the collection or other hotels. You can often just flag this one down and they will stop for you. Overall really happy with the hotel, great customer service from all staff, very friendly and welcoming and great price! Would definitely recommend, my brother stayed at the grand Hayatt and even tho it was bigger pools the service and extra care we received at our hotel was a lot better and we paid a fraction of the price he did. The only negative for me was the bed was very hard, that’s a personal preference but was to solid for me but would happily stay again!"
"Because it's location in Nusa Dua Hotel Area, I love the location, especially if you are in business trip. I highly recommend this hotel. Great service. I was check-in late like 11pm but they still do their best service! Thank you Grand Whiz!"
"Hotels in the exclusive area of Nusa Dua are also exclusively priced. Grand Whiz is reasonably priced, and still has wonderful amenities and access to the same beaches. Had a really lovely stay here."
"The hotel is big and grand, facilities were good, food was good too. The complimentary breakfast was very good and had lots of choices. The room was a bit small but nothing complaining for the price. The beach area is a 15 mins walk away and had to go through a sketchy ally which was dark and felt unsafe as the sun went down. Overall good hotel for the price in nusa dua"
"our stay was simply perfect
we enjoyed our room with pool access (you get pool access via email, they dont offer them in agoda, i dont know why)
the rooms are big, bathroom is perfect
reception roomservice and cleaning stuff extermely friedly (like all bali people it seems)
the hotel isnt directly on the beach which was a reason for us to pick it
surrounded by big hotels in nusa dua this hotel is really worth the money"
"The pool is the best, we swam at several other resorts along nusa dua & always preferred the Grand Whiz. Great customer service & delicious pool side cocktails/mocktails. The resort grounds were immaculate & relaxing. A quick walk to the main beach/ resort strip was great, it was always nice to return to the relaxing vibe :)"
"We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel, one gets good quality service, clean rooms, nice pool area and a nice breakfast and all of this for a 1/3 of the price for any of the resorts in the area. The hotel is new, it doesn't have many rooms so the swimming pool area is nice and quiet. The rooms are big, modern and well appointed. There is a also a small garden. The breakfast was very good, both Western and Asian choices were offered and all tasted very good. We really have no complaints, would come back for sure! And Nusa Dua village is within walking distance, perhaps a 10 minute walk."
"I stayed in this Hotel for four nights. Staff is friendly & nice. Room was okey. Pool in this hotel was great & Its Pool side restaurant is great for having Coffee, Drink & Dinner. Its restaurant is fairly priced too. Local shops from here is at walking distance. 
Dinner Asian menu is great
Fairly priced restaurant, (Pool side)
Good Location- walking distance from shops close by
Excellent clean pool
Easy to get taxi ( taxi drivers outside hotels for a day booking)
Do not go Babboo Bali in Nusa Dua. Its heavily priced. I accidentally paid twice & they refused to pay me back."
"Excellent. Very well-priced stay extremely close to the Nusa Dua Conference Centre. Lovely rooms and grounds, nice pool, no direct beach access but access via a small walkway to beach next to Club Med Hotel. Would recommend for business travelers and those on a budget who don't mind no direct beach access. One thing - my room had a window above the main door which let in a lot of light at night that could not be blocked out - I had to sleep with an eye mask. Not all rooms had this though. Ask for a pool view room!"
"Alls its ok for my family. My baby girl tell me, that if we come again to Bali must stay to Grand Whiz Hotel Nusa Dua"
"Very close to the ocean or beach.Worth of money to stay at grand whiz hotel nusa dua! Clean,quiet of the surrounding ,friendly n helpful staff"
The beds are amazing if you like a firm bed for a solid night's sleep! We had an excellent time and LOVED the lap pool! Only letdown perhaps is the breakfast buffet...we're in bali several times a year and have found the breakfast buffets even in the $30/night hotels to be of great quality....and unfortunately the breakfast selection at the Grand Whiz is way below par in comparison.
"Worth of money to stay at grand whiz hotel nusa dua! Clean,quiet of the surrounding ,friendly n helpful staff"
"Very strategic location, near to airport and other luxury hotels. The buffet is worth it! It give you a great selection of Indonesian cuisine. I will definitely come back and recommend this hotel!"
Place is strategically located in Nusa Dual Beach. Rooms are spacious and clean. Staff is very accommodating and helpful.
"Room bersih,kurang luas jd gk bs tambah extra bed"
New
We stayed for five days. The pool was great. The room was spacious and clean. The restaurant was affordable and the food was good. We could have stayed there without leaving the hotel and would have been fine. The staff was super nice. They take credit card. Minimart 5 minute walk. So is the beach. Would go back.
"room quite clean, all the staff have good service"
Good Location. Not too far from the beach. Quick walk to Alfa Mart and Bali Collection.
"Hotel is located in a very calm and clean place. The pools are 
cleaned periodically."
good
good
Staying for 4 days and 3 nights here and got upgraded to Deluxe from standard. Great value for money and best staying experience.
"Room was very small 
It was clean 
But I wouldn’t recommend people staying there for more than a day maybe the bigger rooms are better."
"I was staying here with my parents and asked the receptionist if it possible to get a room in ground floor and after that they confirmed that we get upgraded so we could stay in the ground floor. 
Room very spacious, very clean, however I have concern on the shower room, it’s very slippery once you showered. Other than that everything was superb.. thank you grand whiz nusa dua.. 👍🏻👍🏻"
Best for money in nusa duo hotel
Overall is fine only it is quite far to the beach area and pool within the premises need to pay to able to use it which is so absurd since it is part of the hotel facilities.
I love the breakfast and the place quite old needs renovations but people are nice and friendly. There's no access direct to Beach need to pass thru on the main road 5 mins. walked but There's swimming pool also.
"Great value & location.  Free room upgrades, on occasions.  Great staff & wonderful pool. Clean.
Breakfasts have improved greatly as has the dining area."
Good
"A beautiful hotel in a great part of town, amazing pool, friendly and attentive staff, had tenderloin for dinner one night and you could pull it apart with a fork, probably my favorite actual room out of all the hotels I stayed at, they gave me a free upgrade when i arrived because it was my first visit, was not able to use workout room because of renovations but i will not knock a place for upgrading there facilities, extra clean room as well and just a great layout for a hotel, Thank you everyone at Grand Whiz Hotel Nusa Dua, I will be back!"
"Beautiful hotel with reasonable price at Nusa Dua that around by many more expensive resorts. Friendly and helpful staff, clean room, beautiful garden, long pool and they have small access way to the beach"
"Great place to stay if you are looking to stay in the quieter part of Bali, Nusa Dua. A few minutes walk from the beach though the hotel doesn't provide beach facilities other than sun beds. Staff were great and very helpful."
"Friendly helpful staff.
Good quite location, Nusa Dua is very clean and no traffic unlike the more crowded popular places like Seminyak and Canggu."
Swimming pool is so nice and the environment is really green. There is just a small issue on the smell of the room.
The toilet and shower room is a bit old. But everything else is fine.
Good
Staff are friendly
"dapat free upgrade, thankyou. kamar bagus besar bersih is all I need"
"We arrived very late at night, but staff were very lively and accommodating. Our rooms, pool and cafeteria were all so clean. Food was great too."
"I really love the food , beach just walk for 200-300m from hotel & to BICC walk via beach with nice view"
They had our room upgraded.  It pays to check in late sometimes.
"Friendly and helpful staff, they upgrade my standart room to deluxe, they offered me a ride to a hotel where the conference i join was held.  Nice stay and good location, near the gate so i can booked online transport easily, for the estate didn't allowed online transport to enter the estate."
The pool is superb - warm water all day long.
"The hotel is OK.  It is positioned in expensive area.  It is 3 levels from the beachfront, however it has its own  beach.  The hotel hs clean, but being positioned in an expensive area it has small garden.  Parking area is OK."
"Love the area, good place to stay for couple, room is clean, good bed, beautiful garden and tropical concept. Staff are so friendly and helping but was waiting long for check out because they need to check our  room before we leave, FO and house keeping not to communication well because the other guest after us in receptionist get first info for his room and he can go easy before us but we still waiting for our room, that a bit wasting time, they need to improve on this case.
Overall we happy to chose this place for our weekend"
I'll be back :)
"good location, many local warung nearby and they are friendly. money change, alfa mart are nearby as well, quite convenient. shuttle bus to bali collection provided, which is good for shopping and dining. 5 mins. to the beach and hv a relaxing time there.  strongly recommended."
"staff were nice and helpful, especially those who sent me to the hospital when I was sick. they cared about my condition even after the day I was back from hospital. Reception staff responded quickly and the rooms were satisfactory."
"will come back again
love the place and location"
"Beautiful hotel. We got upgraded room without additional charge. The room was clean. We could go to the beach, walking about 10 minutes. The breakfast was also delicious, especially ayam tim and ikan goreng sambal matah."
We had a amazing time staying at Grand Whiz hotel. The staff were fantastic and couldn’t do enough for you. We were not far away from the beach and the shopping Mail. Our room was good but need more storage or a chest of draws. Brilliant value for money.
"Nice and clean room,  good options for breakfast,  good environment with a nice garden and swimming pool."
"I would reccomend this hotel to all my friends when visiting Bali , Fabulous lap pool and location to shops/beach friendly and accomodating staff
Thankyou"
"Perfect location, poor beach club"
nice room but when you open the balcony the sound of vibration machine it is too strong somehow we can listen it vague on the middle of night.
"Con
Not right on beach but much cheaper than those that are.
Bit scary walking thru the dark narrow alleyway from the beach when alone at night"
