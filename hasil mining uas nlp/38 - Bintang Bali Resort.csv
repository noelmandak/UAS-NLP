"This hotel is an old hotel and was closed during the covid pandemic. But the plus point of this hotel is its cleanliness, even though it is classified as an old and large hotel, with very many rooms. In addition, this hotel is in a very strategic location, walking distance to the center of tourism and malls in the Kuta area, such as Waterboom, Discovery Mall, Lippo Mall and several well-known restaurants and bars. At the back of the hotel directly connecting with the beach. Room is quite spacious, clean and comfortable. Wifi is available and smooth. Cable TV is available. In the room there is also a wardrobe, deposit box, fridge, hair dryer and room slippers. The room also has a balcony that can be used to relax. AC cold and nice. 
There is also a swimming pool for both children and adults. There are Restaurant and Bar in this hotel as well. The hotel staff is also friendly and helpful. The hotel lobby is very spacious, the car park is also quite large. The weakness of this hotel is the distance from the hotel lobby to the back of the hotel where there is a pool and the beach which is quite far, because of the large number of rooms in this hotel. Also some parts of the hotel and in the room need to be renovated. So, if you want to have a vacation with your family in a good location in the Kuta area, I recommend this hotel for you to stay and vacation."
"Stayed for 6 nights and really enjoyed the time. 
Love the atmosphere, we stayed at ground floor so we enjoyed the garden view. Beware of some bugs/critters if you sensitive to those (but it’s part of the nature that we appreciate).
The beach near the hotel is not as great as the picture, kinda dirty, but you can stroll along the beach to Kuta easily. 
Staffs are friendly and helpful. Room cleaner staff  is so thorough, it was wonderful to be back to the clean room after long day outdoor. 
Wi-fi connection was not so great though. So don’t expect to be able to do some work there especially if you need to do lots of zoom / vdo call. 
The hotel is not so new but they maintain it well. Overall we just love the resort ambiance.
Probably go back here again when we visit Bali.
:)"
"It's a beautiful, well-maintained older style resort with a Balinese feel. The rooms have been tastefully refurbished and are clean, spacious and comfortable. The staff are amazing, very warm and welcoming. They go all out to assist with any issue. The resort is at the quiet end of Kuta with direct access to the beach and a good walking track along the beachfront to Discovery Mall. The gardens are beautiful. Lippo Mall is minutes away with a good supermarket and shopping. There are many good restaurants in the area and on the beachfront. I've stayed in many resorts in the general area but this is my favourite, and in my opinion, the best.  I have no hesitation in recommending this resort. I will certainly return. The only issue I had was with the aircon, it was too hot. Otherwise, 5 stars."
"We loved our stay at this hotel.  The room is spacious and clean. Location is very close to the airport.  The staff are very friendly, the breakfast buffet has lots of options.  The only downside is that the beach itself is dirty, lots of rubbish.  It’s possible that these rubbish gets washed away from somewhere else with the high wind… but you can’t really enjoy the beach because of it."
"Swim up bar and big pool was lovely to enjoy. My superior room was big with a balcony. Air conditioning was good, bed comfortable and the hotel facilities provided a perfect holiday in Bali. Staff were friendly and I felt safe walking outside the hotel and across the street to the ATM. Drinks at the bar can be pricey but is affordable. Food onsite was delicious and an artist painter Made sold me a beautiful piece. Thank you Bintang Bali Resort for a memorable holiday 😊"
"I like bali bintang resort hotel. The location is very close to airport. It just take 10 minutes by car. From Kuta Beach a bit far but it is nice to walking and jogging  followed beach walk. Room is big enough and there is a nice balcony. ( we  stay 2end floor, the sinery is beautiful. Garden view) Staff  members  are all kind and friendly. Breakfast is nice and delicious and that place is also so nice. Swimming pool is also nice and big. You can enjoy sunset there. The hotel is near discovery shopping mall but if you want to go to beachwalk shopping mall, it will take about more then 25 minutes on foot. The hotel garden is beautifully maintained. I love this place to walk. I really enjoyed swimming pool and breakfast time and also sitting on the balcony to relax. We'd like to come back again this hotel."
It is best place to stay in kuta. Nice property with nice swimming pool and just next to beach. Very polite and helpful staff which makes your room everyday nicely. Nice restaurants nearby and near to all popular streets. Best for its price. I’ll stay back here again in my next trip to bali.
"This resort hotel is the whole package, the room, pool, kids playground and beach. Food is good. Room is clean and very comfortable. Hotel staff are so friendly. The only room for improvement is to mKe the check in a bit faster."
"The best location right In front of beach.
 Staff are very accommodating, 3 amazing pools to choose from with one being across from beach.
  My room was very nice and clean air con is always on. I'd definitely stay again"
"good location in live area full of shops resturent supermarket and malls
hotel price cheap 5 years ago i stay in same hotel and pay 4 time more price
every thing is good except the beach water not clean"
"I went here with my family of four. Me and my brother are above 17, yet we really enjoy the facilities. I think it's a great hotel for relaxing, like when you are tired and already finished your itinerary of going around Bali, and you just want to really enjoy your day in a hotel."
"We only had one night on our way through Bali- but I was thoroughly impressed. Cheap, clean, excellent location (so close to airport) and super helpful staff. While the building and facilities are a little old, it’s still great. Pool was excellent for our toddlers, plus a free play room."
it is very quiet here only half full pool is excellent stunning views onto beach breakfast is great all staff are heipfull arrived at 1130am and they still let us check in staight away would stay here again brent thomas
"We booked on Agoda and received a 70% discount on a same day booking. My adult daughter and I love the kind friendly staff, the comfortable beds, the beachside dining service and the fabulous pool."
The room were clean and comfortable. All the staff are friendly and helpful. The kids love the pool.
"The resort is super close to the airport. It’s big and very green, the staff is very nice, the ambience is super chill and breazy. 
The rooms are big and have balcony. The breakfast have so many many options. You can stroll around because its like a campus. The spa areas is super good as well. 
The location is the plus- you go out and get the local vibe, so many restaurants, shops, hawker shops etc etc.
The beach is very close to and have very easy access. Though its common beach therefore wont be very clear and clean as its close to commercial water sport area."
"We loved the traditional building and lush well kept gardens. Ponds and water features were beautiful. Delicious breakfast; swimming pool is big and plenty of chairs surrounding with a swim up bar. It’s on the beach and we could easily relax watching the sun set. The staff were brilliant kind and efficient. 
Early check in and Late checkout! Great location for shopping restaurants etc 
I highly recommend"
"Beautiful resort in a great location.  Staff are amazing & room is spacious, comfortable & very clean. Pool & Abi the pool barman are just awesome. Love the vibe here & would definitely recommend. 5 stars from us ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Location is good, just by the beach, with several minimarts just outside, and a mall about 2 min walk. And an outdoor food court about 5 min walk. The hotel was quiet but not secluded, so if a little quiet time by the beach is what you're after than this could be your choice. The room was clean, pretty spacious, but the furniture and facilities inside could favour an upgrade, because some looked like pretty old. But the water heater and air conditioner was top notch. The restaurant is very good, ambience was nice, food quality and variety was good. Stayed for 2 nights and had different menus for each breakfast. The gym could very much use and upgrade, the equipment was outdated, the sauna didn't work. The staffs are very friendly and helpfull. But all and all, considering the price, they are acceptable. I will consider coming back again."
"Since Kuta is one of paradise in Bali,  Bintang Bali Hotel located in good location in Kuta and it is easy to access to all the city area and can get vrieties of food and restaurants as well. Also having a nice breakfast and good hospitable staffs in the hotels. 
Highly recommend to stay there."
"This hotel is very nice and comfort. We can easily walk to the beach and have a swimming pool. This hotel located in Kuta, we can find food, restaurant, and bar easily. We will go there again with our big family."
"5-star friendly staff and cleanliness. Easy access to food and convenient stores.
The only hotel I stayed this year with stench,,-free pillows and blanket."
Rooms are spacious. They have good set of amenities which you can use like swimming Pool kids play area property is very huge breakfast bread was also pretty decent with good amount of options.
"Best 5 star hotel with clean rooms,facilities,pool,staff and good buffet breakfast. Highly recommended in kuta area. The location is also so good in kartika plaza street which has good nightlife and city life"
"This is a class property. While it has seen better days considering its one of the oldest on Kuta, it is impeccably well maintained. The pool is massive and overlooks the beach. Breakfast was also a huge spread."
"Htl is perfect , location near the apt in Kuta , rooms are spacious and clean.
Staff helpfull and friendly , will certainly 
come back when i am in Dps."
This was a great place to stay. The room was clean and the location on the beach was amazing. I really like the fact that the resort had an adapter already in the rooms.
"Overall was great with all the facilities, from swimming pool, gym, beach front, restaurant, hospitality and conveniently located very near to the airport."
The hotel is so nice eventho it looks old. Those who love tradisional vibe can try out this hotel. The only issued i had during my staycation at Bintang Kuta Resort is water clogged inside our toilet. Even we had launched a complain to the receiptionist but still no action taken. Breakfast so delicious and even variety. Suggestion to those who wanna stay here to rent out a bike if you wanna go anywhere.
"Kids enjoyed thoroughly, pools, kind-of-private beach. Breakfast was good enough. Lots of greenery. Good sized rooms."
Overall the resort is fantastic the staff is very cooperative and friendly pool side is perfect for kids they have free kids club food is yummm
"This hotel exceeded our expectations. We love how it is open and surrounded by nature. Other attractions are so close, which made it easier to get around with kids. Definitely come back to this hotel."
"Amazing experience of morning walk with great view 
sweeming pool with delicious breaks with live balinese paintings and music was amazing. 
Staff is very humble and supportive. 
Restaurant amd market is available near by.
One of best experience of tour in this resort.
Would highly recommend to stay"
"6 th stay at Bintang,best value for money stay,fantastic staff with sense of humour,nothing to much trouble,top location complimented with great pool and beachfront dining,cheers"
"Bintang Bali has the perfect location in Kuta--five minutes away from the DPS (airport). The pool is huge that the kids will definitely love, even the kids at heart. The breakfast buffet at La Brasserie has a wide selection, as well."
Only stayed one  night but enjoyed every minute of it.Very  peaceful and relaxing. Loved the huge pool.
"Very short commute to airport, yet could not hear any air traffic noise. Excellent location on Kuta Beach. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Very nice breakfast and roomservice. My only slightly negative is the rooms, very nice but are showing their age a bit. But I will wholeheartedly recommend Bintang Bali Resort to friends."
"When we arrived the staff very friendly. My big issues is the phone line, I like to call the hotel to confirm my reservation but the line wasn’t working. We stayed for 5 days. When we checked out the phone is still not working. So sad, how they have very slow worker to fix the phone line. Other than that everything was wonderful."
"Thank you very much..i choose family room,spacious and location near the airport around 10mins.
Swimming pool is big and my children enjoyed it very much.
Breakfast has quite a variety everyday.
Its located near kuta beach but beach is very dirty to swim."
"It was amazing hotel with a quite private room, hospitality staff and beautiful kuta beach. 
What a one of recommended hotel near kuta."
Great stay! Room wasp good... service staff were all polite and helpful. Bento breakfast was provided for really early morning check out. Will definitely return to this hotel in the future.
"Massive pool and spa area playground for kiddies relax by the beach or In resort 5 mons walk from main kuta.
   Villas to choose closer to the beach ...resort style living. Can't wait to get back"
"Location, clean and good price."
"fabulous location, easy walk to waterbom and shopping.
Excellent breakfast.
Great value for money.
Peaceful location for us, but I did wonder i f guests closer to the pool and beach might have been disturbed by the tour groups exercising  on the beach with microphones at 8am....."
"Had a great time during our stay. The facilities, staff, location are top notches. Although the breakfast only have few selections, but somehow taste and atmosphere were okay. Recommended hotel."
Bersih danuas serta asri pokoknya recomended bgt deh bintang bali resort best staycation
Awesome! thank you.
I stayed for 3 days in the hotel. Rooms were spacious and staff were kind and supportive.. location is very good
"Great facilities, great staff, breakfast great, hotel room clean and tidy"
I stayed with my family with small kids. Great stay and great hospitality by the staff especially Pak Adi. Highly recommended!
"Wonderful hotel right on the beach with a fabulous pool and great staff, what more can you ask for"
Great hotel. Great location. Breakfast good. Wifi regularly doesnt work. Teenage kids not impressed with that part. Overall very good
"Had a great stay.  The hotel might be old but the facilities is great and for what I paid, a bang for my buck.  Love the pool and it is huge.  Staffs are nice and very accommodating.  They are willing to go above and beyond to ensure that you will have a memorable stay. The room is nice and a good size.  Location is great with lots of eateries, coco mart, circle K and banks with ATM just right outside and lippo mall right next to the hotel..  Vey convenient. Breakfast was good.  However, if you stay longer than 4 days, you will get tired of it as the pretty much served the same breakfast everyday."
"Great location, really nice rooms and amenities. Staff could be a bit more helpful and at least show me where my room was. Took a while to find it on my own."
"Elegant buffet, delicious food, excellent service. Love the large pool."
"Very nice hotel near beach, hotel is beautiful with natural tress all around the area and big garden and swimming pool , 
Rooms are also very spacious and clean with all required facilities 
Its also on premium area so all things are available on walking distance. 
Bar and restaurant are available all around it and transportation can be easily found from the hotel"
"i am check in maybe 12 am morning, and request to extend check out, the staff very helpfull and love it the food, bigger hotel and pool view beach or closed the beach. old hotel but very nice...."
"The hotel is old but well maintained.  All the rooms are complete.  Air conditioning is strong.  wifi is weak.  The pool facing the beach is very big.  But the beach is not very clean.  Breakfast is ok, but a bit lacking for a 5 star hotel.  It may be unavoidable because it is a pandemic.  In any case, I am satisfied with this price."
We stayed two nights between arriving from the Gili islands and onward transfer to the airport.  It was 15 minutes by taxi so ideal for early flight.  Rooms were good and staff welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast buffet was average with limited vegetarian options but good enough.
"Really love the ambience in this hotel, although the hotel is bit old, but the vibes are still good with green environment and rocky solid architecture. We got free photograph service from the hotel."
"All are great, esp the food and the room service"
"Very close to Denpasar airport about 10 minutes drive. Just outside the resort lot of shopping facilities available, overall resort is in a very good and convenient location"
The rooms are always clean and it's easy to travel around.
"The Hotel is an oasis of tranquility amidst the buzzing noise of Kuta. Rooms are sparkling clean, staff is very friendly and accommodating, the breakfast buffet has a variety of choices, and the food is very delicious. The pool is huge and enough sunbeds are available. A private quiet stretch of beach. Perfect value for money."
"Market nearby with lot of eating options.
Just great."
"Amazing breakfast spread, very helpful staff, big rooms with outside seating area, huge pool, beach access, great location, value for money -- they've got it all."
"3in1… spacious garden area with flowers, greenery trees, cool air, blends with a beautiful beach, there is a children's play area…"
"We stayed at Bintang Bali Resort in January 2023 with extended family. Rooms were clean, with all expected “extras” (body wash, shampoo, sewing kit etc, even umbrellas to use!).  We were on the ground floor in interconnecting rooms which overlooked the tropical gardens. Pool was lovely and a great temperature with free pool towels. Sun loungers readily available. Pool bar (and staff) were excellent. Meals a little bit pricey but not over the top. Good restaurants close-by with a fantastic Vietnamese Warung directly opposite. Would we stay again? Yes as the hotel had everything we wanted and did not disappoint however we probably won’t stay again as we like to try different places.  Would definitely recommend."
"i loved it we take a connecting room and it was just on the swimming pool , near the beach, in general everything was great but the breakfast was ok , and they were very helpful we had a late flight so they let us do late check out it was really helpful specially we have a little kids ,"
"Arrived on Monday a wee bit earlier than usual and the hotel allow us to check in earlier. That’s a 200% awesome for me. 
Room is okay. Very cozy. And staff came earlier to check if I need to room to be cleaned fresh every new day.
Facilities are so so. Pool is okay but the health room is very quiet and somewhat scary. I wanna use the sauna but no staff to attend me.
Foods for breakfast is also okay. 
Location is also great. Easy to access it."
All are excellent except the wifi sux and the beach is not in the best shape
Best location. Best facility.
"I stayed there for two night, the room is very clean and spacious, if you like the quietness at night while you sleeping this is the hotel or maybe I just got the room far away from the pool😅
Quite close to everything. Massage place just on the right side when you exit the hotel if you need a coffee hit walk a bit further to lippo mall and there you find Starbucks and others foods stalls."
"Actualy there is no beach. Or there is one, quite big i would say, except is extremly dirty. And the hotel sais that is a public beach and they can not clean it. It s a pity, that such a good hotel, has a beach that can not use it because of too mich garbage on it"
"We stayed 3 nights.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Close to airport and Waterbom. Rooms ok, a bit dated and rough around the edges, but fair with the price paid.  Good buffet breakfast selection.  Shame smoking is allowed in the hotel, particularly the outer part of the restaurant.  This wasn’t pleasant at breakfast.  Don’t book this hotel expecting an idyllic beachfront location.  The beach is dirty and rundown with renovations taking place.  Pool and pool bar were fine with reasonable drink prices and happy hour deals."
"Excellent location 
Beautiful gardens, huge and deep pools
If you like swimming this is the best choice in Bali"
"Exterior of hotel and surrounding grounds are just what you'd expect of a hotel of this size - outstanding.  The pool area is lovely but could do with a few more shaded areas.  The room interiors are looking a bit dated with the dark stained woodwork and furniture. If you're looking for a hotel in Kuta that's beachfront and central, then I would stay here again."
Rekomendasi utk famili dan couple
This is the best deal for a family vacation.
"This resort is at a good location and got a good deal on Agoda. Very near to airport, beach touch and also most of the restaurants available within 5-10 mins of walking distance. Also have lot of Indian restaurants including vegetarian food options. 
Will definitely recommend 👍🏻"
"Room is OK and the garden space is fantastic.  Even it is an old hotel but it is well maintained, no worry about sockets, internet comparing to other hotel I stayed last month.  I was right to select this hotel and will surely come back next visit to Bali."
Located not so far from the airport. Many restaurants and mini mart surrounding the hotel. Big room to stay with children. Many variation of food for breakfast. Comfortable swimming pool. Direct access to beautiful beach at the backyard. A very recommended hotel to stay.
"Breakfast was good, and the hotel
Is big an clean. Great pool on the beach side"
Value for money!
"Big room, clean & great location"
For young kid the issue on mosquito
"Hotel and rooms are convenient and in good condition. Facilities for adults and kids are plenty. Has its own private beach.
Check in time is long (maybe understaffed). Breakfast is good enough but not exceptional, taste could better. Doesn’t feel like 5-star hotel, more like 4-stars. But at the price, it is good.
Breakfast serves Indian food in addition to Indonesian and bread, so Indian guests will feel at home."
"We moved around from Sanur hotel to  Resort in Kuto area. Again lots of restaurants, hotels, resorts  shopping mall, bank, Catholic church,souvenir stores.
We know we did not have enough time to experience other areas.
City centre is so near to airport.
Beach front.
Room is clean, nice, hot water, elevator, good staff"
"it's nice place, I have been stayed"
"The hotel right in front of the beach.
Family friendly and the staff also very helpful."
Will be back to this hotel 👍🏻
Good for value and nice location
"Was really a great stay staff was friendly, even though the place is huge and there is many guests they made us feel very special, thank you guys"
"The property is value for money . Located near the airport n party places . Beach is just opposite to the property . Rooms r cozy n warm with modern interiors .
Loved the property"
Beautiful Hotel and fantastic location!!
Great value and excellent resort in Kuta!
Many shops and restaurants conveniently close by. Great international breakfast buffet too. I would rate it 8.5-9/10.
Recommended place to stay with family.
very good value for money...
Friendly staff and good facilities
Location is ideal for a few nights stay (we stayed for 3 nights) right close to the airport. Cons.. the beach was extremely disappointing as even though the hotel states that it is a beach resort the beach itself was dirty with plastic and rubbish laying on the coastline.. Obviously it has been washed up from the sea but more effort can be made to clear it up so that guests can swim in the sea... I myself was disgraced with how much rubbish was washed up have never seen anything like it and put me off going in the sea.. and on the beach. Such a shame as the hotel and pool were excellent. The bedrooms were comfortable but again needed updating. The staff made our holiday very friendly and spot on service
"Good locatiin,Clear,friendly staff"
Good service and good place
Everything was perfect. The hotel accomodated our request to rechedule our stay without any hassle. Appreciate it.
"Breakfast was good with wide variety.
Pool was amazing.
Very near to airport staff was helpful too.great stay"
"All are good except the internet at my room, could not do anything with its internet."
"located nearby airport, with huge compound,garden,swimming pool"
It is a great hotel. This location is good because near to mosque and easy to found halal food. But it is too far from beach and any other tourist attraction.
The resort is at prime location and is very clean. I would highly recommend stay here.
"Great quite resort, but 20 mins walk to Kuta and 2 minutes to Malls and shopping. Fantastic pool area and beautiful quiet grounds. Wifi is a bit unpredictable at times, but otherwise excellent resort."
"Excellent reception staff. Rooms are classic and nice. Lovely pool, but it closes at 8pm.
Breakfast was chaotic as hotel seem full.
Spacious property is a true resort. Resort food prices on high side,’but plenty of food options surrounding.."
"Great hotel I have stayed in many hotels in Bali over the year this is by far the best.
Great location right on the beach, great value for money.
I was originally going to stay at the Bali Dynasty but was over double the price of the Bali Bintang but I would say the Bintang is much better will be going back."
This is an ideal hotel for a family holiday. We stayed in connecting room. Requested for extra bed and it came soon after the call. Breakfast food was not too bad but nothing fancy. Pool was great! Beach bar is awesome too. Rooms are clean. Great location  and ambience.
"Great location, nice beach, nice pool, lots of food around"
"Location was amazing, true beach front property and yet conveniently close to lippo shopping mall ."
"lokasi bagus, pantai, taman, kolam renang semua bagus."
Nice place to stay with family
Only staff response need improvement.. n AC need maintenance cleaning to make cooler than before
"The hotel is huge by Balinese standards, over 400 rooms. Despite the size it manages to maintain a Balinese feel - not like some of the Box type hotels that are being built now.
Impressive entrance and lobby, large comfortable rooms and a decent breakfast.
Rooms are as you would expect, they have a/c, fridge and satellite tv.
Huge pool area right on the beach - no sun beds on beach currently - needs to be cleaned up before this happens as it’s not as shown in the hotel photos.
If possible ask for an inward facing room - the hotel is built in 2 block, outer facing rooms do not have a decent view as the6 face into bear adjoining buildings. The inward facing rooms will be brighter and have a better outlook."
"This luxury accommodation screams space! Everything is spacious from room, restaurants, gardens, pools and more. There are so many amenities that a day wouldn't be enough for you to enjoy. The private front beach itself is great for surfing, sunbathing or simply swimming. The resort is 8 minutes away from the airport and when you go outside the gate, you're already close to shopping areas, restaurants, drugs stores and malls. It's absolutely value for money."
