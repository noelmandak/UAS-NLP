"Good for the price and location wise. 
Kinda noisy because its near the main road and the shower room window is open. 
Very nice location, near to market, warungs, sb , pharmacy and groceries. 
Thank u delu villa, will surely choose your place the next time i visit bali again."
"Clean, fast to check in/ out.Locations accessible to restaurants and mini mart."
"Nice place but small road to enter, parking area is small"
"It is a little bit out the way if you were wanting shopping or nightlife, but taxi's are available at the door.  For us it was perfect. Quiet, friendly staff and a great breakfast.
We will be back again."
"Ver nice e Villa, they also have wonderful set up, romantic and unique.  Staff are also accommodating and friendly. You will definitely enjoy your stay here! Til' next :)"
Everything was perfect. Thank you :)
"hotel at a fantastic price! I stayed for a week there with my sister and niece, because there is a small garden in the room so that my niece can play in the room. I love being able to cook especially my niece still eats special food. The very friendly waitress made me feel like I was at home."
The staffs are very accommodating and very helpful I love the location it is near in coffee shops restaurants drug store and convinient stores. I recommend Delu villas to all who love traveling in Bali
"DeLu is a good budget hotel. The rooms are large. The aircon is good and quiet.
Breakfast was included but no water upon arrival. Very handy next to LiO market."
"I read many bad reviews on google maps after I booked this place (my bad)
When the day came, I crossed my finger and I wish I have better experience than google folks.
Turn out, the room is quite good. The room is clean, AC works well, and I got beautiful garden in the backyard. 
The problem is just the TV. It only has 3 local channel but I don't need TV so it's not a problem for me.
Oh, I got small kitchen but it's not included with the gas and kitchen equipment. 
Not forget to mention, the breakfast is tastyyy 
I recommend this place if you want to strolling around denpasar-canggu."
Great small hotel..outside main area but ok if you have transport
Everything is good but air conditioning not cold enough
Wifi is slow
"This place really  looks good on the website, for one night stay in kerobokan. But after checked in I found out that the ac is leaking,  the sliding door in the toilet ,not working properly. The lights are fused . Only 1 lights is working in the bedroom (supposed to be 4 light) there were marks on the bedsheets. Told the staff the problem in my room and asked if I can just move to another room , but he said ( fully booking :D) he quick bought 3 lamps for my room and mop the water from the leaking and when i told him about the toilet door, he said "" yeah that was broken long time ago"" :D"
"many resto & stores around the hotel...but pretty busy traffic.
hotel room size is good incl.small pantry & cooker...
but the bathroom is awfull, toilet not correctly attached...wall is dirty...
& the bed is hard & smelly...pillows are smelly...i had running nose whole night☹️...
but what can you expect for a cheap price one"
Location is good. Staff not so helpful. We arrived in the evening from Canggu. Room was very spacious but not that clean. Beddings and pillows smells like foot. We asked for them to be replaced but they said housekeeping is not available. Even the towels doesn't smell good. Kitchen and bathroom looks old and not so clean. Water supply is weak. Many mosquitoes and spider in room. We asked for insect killer spray but staff said they ran out. 😓😓😓
"The hotel ya like that Nothing much 
Breakfast With Little Nasi goreng and Just a Very Little of  Fried Eggs Very Very little Even for my kids not enough haha🤣 With Little Mineral water just 1 also  ...😂😂😂 hope They can change it soon ya"
"there's a lot of stain in the bed sheet, also it feels like you breath dust in there. and the flush in closet is so poor. but the staff is fast respon."
"Good place, nice staff"
"The staff were friendly and the room was clean. It was nice having breakfast included, though the options of noodles or rice seemed to be all over the place as each morning we were there they brought a different breakfast than we requested (not an issue to us).. our safe was also broken which we addressed in our first hour after check in. We were assured that it was being handled, yet gave up after our 4th time asking (kept being told someone was coming to look at it), and after 5 days it was never fixed. 
The pool was relatively nice (public pool), and the location was central enough to be able to walk to beaches and malls- Seminyak is very busy so it was convenient to be able to walk or grab cheap scooters lifts through apps.  With how busy the road was that the hotel is on, it was nice that it is tucked away a bit from traffic."
"Everything Perfect, just the staff was busy flirting with a single tourist girl at night in lobby and our AC was not working, for which I asked him to come two times which he came reluctantly and gave us standing fan."
"The floor is not clean there are sand, the toilet is stink. I've ask the reception if they have camphor or carbolic, but they said they don't have. So I need to buy one."
"Not impressed,  kitchenette with no cooking utensils or pans.  In serious need of maintenance.  All showers heads were covered in white like calcium build up affecting pressure and water flow. All over sink aswell.  Otherwise it was kept clean"
A tad put of the way but once you rent a bike its got a great pool and staff with a huge breakfast and cold fridge...
"I was in Bali for a birthday weekend bash, so all I was looking for was room with a bed.
The photos on Agoda looked nice enough and the price was right.
The room was fine, clean, bed, wardrobe... very friendly staff... 
The pool looks bigger and better in the photos than in real life. You would not spend any time there, let alone pass the afternoon with your friends or family by the pool.
There is no food to be had in the hotel. 
So, if you are just looking for a place to sleep, but you will be out as soon as you wake up and you will not be back until it is time to sleep again, this is a great hotel.
Anyone who intends to spend time in the room or at the hotel might want to look elsewhere."
"Found this place at last minute, but turned out it’s ok. I chose it cuz it has small kitchen to cook (since I am vegan). It has nice small pool. Perfect location to walk around to nice restaurants, groceries stores, and shopping areas. Unfortunately the place itself looks kinda old. They should definitely so some renovations and improvements (because my tab couldn’t be tightly closed, my shower pipe was leaking, the door to the balcony was hard to open, and the tv antenna was loose). But of course they fixed them (except for the tab). They deliver the bfast to our room, so that’s cool. Since my room is downstairs right behind the Reception, it’s kinda loud."
"The accomodation is in nice location, not that clean, need to work on the ventilation (Need more window at least to see the sunrise), too noisy from other room. But the staff were really friendly, I did not spend so much of my time at the hotel at least it's okay to have a room for a sleep. 
Thank you for the stay! Needs some improvements."
"They said that the hotel is hygiene plus certified but the room wasn't that clean. When we first came, the room was smell of molds, the bed cover was stained and the color of the bed cover was already off. During our stay here my whole body was itchy everytime we slept, the water also smell like iron and the toilet was also smelly even though they clean regularly. 
Also, we booked superior room because agoda stated that it has garden view"
"What can i say, a lot but will not so if you don’t really find anywhere else in all Bali and must have a roof over your head for one night ONLY you can stay here. The only good thing was the air cond…. forget about breakfast if you stay. If you take your own car you will have a nightmare going out on the main road and the staff will not give a sh..t about stopping the traffic…. NEVER AGAIN"
"This is the first time I gave such a low star for a private pool villa at Bali. So pity Agoda didn’t let the user put the real picture. The condition was different from Agoda’s description. It was very dirty, lots of bird *hit, not a fresh one. The wooden floor near the swimming pool is broken, some nails was rusty and on the surface. Very dangerous. They didn’t put trash bin inside the bathroom, no handsoap to wash your hand too. And the breakfast was so terrible. Only by looking it you know that it’s not well made. So we didn’t eat but I managed to take some pictures out of it. The only good thing was the staff was helpful and friendly."
"It’s cheap, but you barely get what you pay for. Room is big, apart from that, nothing good to say. And the smell from bathroom is terrible. Breakfast is a choice of fried rice or fried noodle, and a small bottle of water, that’s it. If you want a big cheap room, and you are out most of the time, it’s ok. If you have looked at website and base your expectations on that, you will be disappointed. It’s a big, cheap, crash pad."
Photos are nothing like how the place looks like in person!
"I really regret my decision to stay here. I feel like I'm beeing fooled because the picture and the conditionion is almost 100% different. When i arrived at the hotel, there's only one staff were there and he didn't welcomed me nor help me taking out the luggage from the car. The room is humid so badly and don't have any window so the air feel so bad. The floor is quacking, there's big stain on the wall, and it feels so dusty. And the pillow feels like it's been used for yeara because it yellowish huhu! I did ask the staff to change the pillow but they didn't change it. The water from the shower only provide small amount and it stinks. The flush didn't worked! There's no single thing that feels good. The staff in the morning and the cleaning lady are friendly tho"
"Worst place to stay at. Extremely unclean, dirty bathroom, full of mosquitoes & tap water leakage. Do not stay here unless absolutely necessary!!"
tidak cocok
"Bad services, bad problem solving, my phone charger & clothes was lost before 2 hours left the place, the receptionist wasn't cooperative with problem solving solutions"
I believe the hotel has had its best time before. But not now. The pool is dirty. Dried leaves. Dead plants. Even the toilet is dirty. Seriously people? You guys need to do some maintenance if you still want some businesses.  The traffic jam at this area is not acceptable. I will never return.
No welcome drink as as says…. Swimming pool is green and super dirty…. Rooms full of flies and mosquitos…. Ac does a very loud noise and doesn’t cool up….. backyard door doesn’t close or lock…. Not clean dirt everywhere….. staff are rude…… towels where dirty….. shampoo doesn’t have any label on it and doesn’t smell like shampoo smelt like someone urinated in it very poor and bad service and on a loud street
"The room smelled like fish as there was a pound indoors, the furniture was worn with graffiti on the sofa, the air conditioner in the bedroom was leaking, with a big puddle on the floor. Requested a room change, the staff showed us a room which was in a poor condition much like the one we checked into. We had our 5-month-old baby with us so we decided to go elsewhere, the manager refused to refund our money, even after listening to our complaints."
"Well, don't stay here unless all the other hotels in Bali are full & you desperately need a shelter on your head. Horrible place with mosquitos & not even basic amenities. Even the restroom doesn't have a proper ventilation. The whole place sucks!!"
Worst hotel I have ever been to
Very poor hotel bad location staff are rude not nice at all nothing in the ad was mentioned I received from welcome drink I even asked for it they wouldn’t give me the swimming pool was green and dirty looked like a pond disgusting the ac done a loud noise and didn’t work good sheets and towels had dirt on them toilet flush did t work proper the back yard door didn’t lock I do not recommend this place at all very bad
"everything is bad from cleaning to everything , please don't stay there"
"We rented delux but it was a small and dirty room without windows, we couldn’t stay there"
dirty hotels
"the room was nice, large, air conditioner good, the area of the villa was so large (maybe suit for more thatn 8 people) and clean, they have private pool, they also provide with DVD player, iphone or samsung speaker dock, living room with sofa and TV, TV in each room, dining table and kitchen also provided.
1 booked villa with 3 rooms, each room can be use for 2 adult or 3 children each, and each room have bathroom but unfortunately my bathroom has a very bad condition, the smell very bad even when the staff hotel has sprayed the air perfume still does not work. but if this condition did not happened, overall my review of this villa is one of the best villa in Seminyak area. 
the breakfast was so good with a lot of variety of american, french, or indonesian food, but they don't have restaurant. the market is just next the villa so you can buy food or anything there while there's no restaurant in the villa. the parking area is very small maybe only available for 3 or 4 vehicle but they provide transport from or to airport. 
at last, this is great villa and i definitely recommend this villa to others."
"Me and my fiance stayed at Delu Villas for our holiday in Bali for 5 days. We really had a good time at this place and we extended to one more day. The first great thing about the place was the service. The staff were very friendly and attended to all our requests. They gave us truly personalised services and even gave us advice on where to go, which places to visit etc. 
We stayed at the Seminyak room which came with a kitchenette and the staff provided us with cooking utensils and anything else we needed. They came over every night to spray mosquito repellent all around the room. We did not have much trouble with mosquitoes at all. The room was clean and comfortable and really good value for money. 
The location was good, a few minutes ride away from seminyak beach. There were supermarkets and convenience stores nearby and our hotel was just beside a night market. 
Overall we were very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay there if we had the chance again."
"Delu Villas are stunning, amazing location, incredibly friendly staff, it was my birthday during our stay and they turned up at our door with a Birthday Cake. which was very nice of them. We did however feel that because we had booked on an aggregator type website meaning we pay slightly less than full price that we were given one of the not so nice rooms, by no means was the room awful but it was just a feeling we had, the staff we friendly so friendly that you saw them loads knocking on your door to spray mosquito repellent or fix a light. nice touches but a little intrusive at times."
"While we had a couple of minor issues that were dealt with promptly by the very courteous staff, we really enjoyed our stay at Delu. The bedrooms were clean and the staff serviced them every day, the private pool was fantastic, a welcome place to return every day. They could do to make sure there are no leaks (we had one toilet have a leaky roof on a particularly heavy rain day), and make sure they maintain things a little better, but the actual bedrooms and villa were excellent value for money.
The location is a little out of the way in Seminyak, but you can get a Blue Bird Group taxi for the minimum cost (30,000) to the main tourist part of Seminyak. Plenty of shops very close by if you need anything. We had access to a pharmacy and grocery stores within a 5 minute walk.
I would certainly stay here again on my return to Bali."
"We stayed in a Seminyak room. Since we know our way around Seminyak/Kerobokan it was the perfect location, easy to go to Canggu, Seminyak and to access Sunset road to go to the rest of the island. 
The room was big, good tv and a mini kitchen. You need to ask for the utensils you need if you want to cook tho, but the staff will try their hardest to accommodate any wish. We had a microwave put in right away for example. 
Bathroom was ok, shampoo and soap provided but bad water pressure. 
We didn't get any furniture to have in the little patio which was a disappointment since it would be a nice place to sit. We never used the pool, it looked nice but probably doesn't get that much sun due to the high walls around it. 
Breakfast was alright a few choices of eggs and the like, you can have it delivered to your room or have it by the pool. 
It is located on a pretty busy street and you can hear traffic sometimes. It's not really disturbing but be aware it isn't dead quiet at any time. 
All in all we were very satisfied, especially since we got a really good deal on the price."
"Overall, Great Stay in Delu Villas. Beautiful Villa, Staff was friendly and helpful. Location was good, nearby 15mins max to travel places. Just some improvements needed.
- Breakfast needs more variety and more taste especially the Indo Breakfast.
- Villa needs to improve on maintenance such as toilet water, sink water all keep coming back brownish.
- Need more plugs in Rooms and Kitchen (3 appliances sharing 1 plug without multi purpose plug means I have to wait for my hot water to finish before using the microwave, etc.
- Aircon needs maintenance, super super slow to turn on (takes 2 hours to get cold) and had to ask the makeup room staffs to keep the aircon on hence the room stayed cold when we return for the day.
Will i return to stay here? Unlikely as I would prefer to explore other villas with same value."
"Always good To be back to DELU Villas , staff always Welcome , nearby to local market where you can get food even at night , and room Is huge , wifi Is Works Well keep up the good Work , for Sure will Come back 👍🏻👍🏻"
"I just arrived from Java when I went to the Delu hotel. I needed a place to stay for a few nights, time to look for a long term accomodation in Bali.
The staff was nice and trying to help to make my stay comfortable, which is a good point. 
The girls at the reception had always a smile to give when I was running into them, which was pleasant.
The pool area was nice to chill out, BUT the sun doesn't really come around the pool, what a pity...
I didn't have the mosquitoes problem because the staff was around to put some product, thank you guys 
For the breakfast I can't say anything because it wasn't included in the price. I had a discount with Agoda and paid something like 15 euros per night which was pretty good 
The area is full of cool places to eat and there is also a supermarket where you can buy fresh fruit and a lot of stuff 
Sunset Road was 5 minutes away by cab (around 25 000 rp) 
Oberoi street with all the good restaurants, bars, and nice little shops can be reach by walking (about 20 minutes) 
For the closest beach it was about 2-3 kilometers away, but I took cab so it was just something like 7 minutes 
To sum up, the hotel was ok for the price I paid but something was really uncomfortable and could be improve : there was no window in my room !!
I really felt stuck sometimes, and I was obliged to turn on the air con to have some air, but the air con made me so sick... !
That's the only real negative point about my stay here"
"We really enjoyed our stay at Delu Villa. The service was excellent, the villa was exactly like how it was described on the website. We would definitely recommend it to our friends and families."
"I would definitely stay at the De'Lu Villas again, but will opt for any one of the private pool villas before a suite again. We chose to upgrade after one night as we wanted to stay in luxury for our last few nights in Bali, and the suite we payed (very little) for didn't offer such a luxurious standard. Though our one bedroom private pool villa did offer this, when we checked out and spent the day shopping before our late evening flight, sweating profusely as you do in Bali, we were offered by the staff to have a shower in a two bedroom pool villa... When the staff showed us inside, our eyes lit up like children! If we had the need for two bedrooms we may have never left the villa! So beautiful and luxurious, with privacy to boot."
"Really love this hotel, I don't think you get such friendly staff and comfortable rooms anywhere. One thing I must note is that some of the rooms in the same rate differ quite significantly, there are seminyak rooms that have a garden that is 4 times larger than those of some others. Even though all rooms are easily worth the money I think they should submit the larger seminyak rooms in a different category."
"My son and I stayed in the Seminyak rooms for 5 days and then my wife, son and I stayed in the 3 bedroom villa for 2 nights. The Seminyak rooms were fantastic and for $50 a night it was value for the money. The 3 bedroom villa was unreal value and made you feel like a movie star, staff were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay at the hotel again."
"I found this hotel as a last minute deal and very cheap rate of around 220,000rp per night. For this price I was absolutely blown away. Even more so when I started to ask other people how much they were paying to stay in Seminyak and they were paying 1,000,000rp per night for places that looked nothing fancy.
The cleanliness of this hotel is flawless. Staff changed the sheets and towels very regularly and made beds look immaculate every day. Room was large with a very large wardrobe, cooking facilities, large bathroom & TV with lots of english channels. They had a pool around the back that was fenced off and had 3 loungers. The pool area was nice but fairly small and I can imagine would get crowded easily at busy times. But it worked out fine for me.
Location is approx 20 mins walk from the beach and 5-10min walk from bars restaurants and shops. I did walk to the beach on my first day but it is not something that you would want to make a habit of in the daytime (heat nearly killed me) but a taxi would cost you practically nothing so I don't see this as an issue.
Overall this is probably the best value hotel that I have stated in taking into account the price I paid and even if you were charged a little more then its still a very good option in my eyes."
"I stayed at Delu for quite some time, especially because I love the service. They staff is very friendly and welcoming. The location is practical with easy access to beaches, shops and Denpasar. It also feels very secure. I'll happily come back again!"
"Private pool Is Nice , location ok next to traditional market If youre looking for local food , really good for group, bed Is Comfyy, over all so Nice and would Def Come back to DELU villa"
"we really love this villa, we rented the 3bedroom villa and we've got out own private pool. the rooms are all spacious. the living room is nice with kitchenette. and the breakfast is also good. we really love it here, the price is really cheap for groups like us. i would recommend this villa"
"This is the 2nd time I stayed in Delu, and was given the room at the top floor. I noticed that there were only two room doors at this floor, and the room I stayed in was actually quite a disaster. It was nothing like the room at the ground floor, a bit smaller, much dirtier, with AC that did not work very well and weak water pressure. It was the only room left at that day but luckily I got moved downstairs the next day. The hotel management should be able to make an equal standard for every room. I think Seminyak Rooms at the ground floor are the best here."
"Pros :
- Location : it was located near a drugstore & Local Market with lots of local foods and stores. 10 minutes walk from alfamart, and 10-15 minutes walk to pizza, dominos, and local foods restaurants. The shops near the villa was soooo expensive (1 simple sheer dress cost IDR 290.000) So i would not recommend to shop near the hotel, go buy somewhere else. Also it was located near beachclubs.
- Cleanliness : The room was very clean!
- Room : The room has a small kitchen, a toilet with shower. The bed was awesome. 
- Restroom : shower was good, but it's not very clean and well maintain. But still good. 
- Breakfast : the taste is good, and suite my taste buds
Cons :
 booked the seminyak room (in agoda it says that the room got a small garder) but we got the kerobokan room (no garden) for the price i pay 289/night for seminyak room, and get the kerobokan which was 209/night. I asked the staff, but the say the one that i got was the one i booked."
"Good value for money, cheap but great. Not too close to center of seminyak, good price with grab to the center of seminyak (near seminyak village). Good breakfast and they deliver the breakfast to our room."
"Booked 2 nights & it was so worth it. From the check-in & check-out, it went pretty smoothly. Reall had great stay here. Large private pool. Large bed. Nice breakfast (The nasi goreng is the best!). For the price that I pay, the villa is beyond words. The only I dislike was the towel, dirty & old. Our aircond in the bedroom leaking & dripping. No label for the syampoo. Sometime can hear noise from the roads. Nevertheless , good stay.  Will definitely recommend this villa to family & friends."
"I've been stayed here for 2nights last november 2014, the normal price here a bit expensive for me as a student but i've lucky date of my birthday and got 70% discount. the location is strategist and it has comfortable bed and large room also green balcony and delicious food as i mentions, i love it and i'd like to come back again sometimes :* Thank you Dellu Villas and Suite"
The hotel not showing the exacty picture on the website. They show the luxury villa. Beware if u booking this hotel. So dissapointing
"Noisy AC exhaust, bed uncomfortable feels like an old spring bed. There’s a kitchen but useless it’s not functioning."
I bought a room with kitchen. There is kitchen but not gas ni tools to cook… recepcionist said if i want to cook i shoukd buy the gas and tools
"the location of the hotel is in a traffic jam area from morning to evening, there is no welcome drink.  the aminities at the hotel were not complete enough and I got a room with no windows even though we came for a honeymoon. The staff is nice and helpful."
loved it
"The room given to me was so dirty. Bedsheets and pillow covers were dirty. Then I asked staff to change these so they did. I asked for room change but they said that they don’t have any vacant room. I booked it for 5 nights but left it after 3 night. Will never suggest anyone to stay here. 
In the same value, you can easily get a nice and clean room in a 4 star hotel."
Best experienced i ever had after 2 years hola
Good hotel for solo traveler
at first we thought its fine but as we go inside the sheets are so dirty it even have a stain of i dont know if lipstick or blood and the seat of the toilet is not fix it even smell like poop my god. kindly please fix it!
"Nice building but not well maintained, TV is not working  until I check out,  the water is not good bed smells.."
"If u see the sink u will puke, the bathroom is not cleaned, they gave kitchen but dosen't work, cup and plates were dirty"
"Very dirty villa  everything is broken,bad smell  in everywhere no cleanliness,I moved out  before  Chek out date"
"Nice comfy clean bed, good Air conditioner and fast wifi. What more could you want if you are spending your days out and about. Plenty of cost affective eating places near by. I definitely would stay here again.
Douglas PERTH WESTERN AUSTRALIA"
Would definitely book again
"Checked in quite late, got to our room and went into the bathroom to be greeted by an awful smell, which soon became apparent to be the excessive amount of moth balls that had been placed over the drains (about 10) which were also wet which made the smell even more potent. Had my husband take them outside I'm asthmatic and couldn't breath in there. In the morning opened up the villa doors and tried to circulate the air but there was no making it better. After 1 night I had a massive migraine from the smell and asked front desk to attend to it, was told the moth balls were there because all the drains were blocked (like that's meant to make it acceptable?!) We were offered another room which they then decided to paint the walls and expect it to be ok for my asthma...then when I asked for the rest of my stay to be refunded and I will go elsewhere, they argued I had agreed on booking no refund as if it was my fault they tried to put me in rooms that were not fit for human occupation."
"29 degrees with the air conditioning on full blast, water from tap was brown on last day, swimming pool looked uninviting. Location awkward. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was decent"
"I stayed at one-bedroom villa. 
I really enjoyed the place. It was pretty place. Facilities was good. Pool size was very good.
Cons
The place need few fixes at floor and swimming pool."
"the staff is really helpful, and i love the breakfast <3 they deliver it to my room"
So noisy from traffic.
"It pleasure to stay here and nice place for a couple since its provided anything we need. Only 1 point that mke us dnt feel cmfort, close to main road so little bit noisy however overall is a nice place to stay.."
Me and my friends were so happy be there. The services are great.
"The place is a very good location for a lot of things - just 8 mins to seminyak beach, probably less than 5 mins to spa and stores nearby. Restaurants just right across even a market nearby. The cleanliness has to be improved though. There were a lot of molds around the villa we rented but overall it was a really good place to stay."
Facilities were value for money. Room servicd wasn't that good though. We asked to have our towels changed because they clearly had not been changed when  room service came to clean the place up. Before being handed the fresh towels the staff member had the audacity to try argue that the towels we had were clean.. other than that a lot more could be done to clean up. Location isn't that great either. Not a place I would visit a second time I'm afraid. Our money could have been better spent elsewhere.
We will never go back to this place
pls improve your pool cleanliness. i got itchy a lot when im back to my country.
"Location is strategic but expect traffic jam in front of the entrance. Very minimum parking lot. The staff were very hospitable and nice.  With a private plunge pool, it was a value for money"
The Place is very nice. I would highly recommend this villa.
"Did not like my stay here. The location was just behind a very busy area with a heck of a lot of traffic. My room in the villa was large and it had functioning aircon and warm water but that’s about all that met my requirements. The towels and bedding were absolutely absolutely FILTHY looking (I’m sure they were washed, but they desperately need changing as they are no longer their original white condition!!!) you have to keep logging in on the WiFi every few minutes, which was really annoying. Staff spoke very minimal English."
Don't have breakfast area don't have lobby for seat don't have twing bath room to old towel to dirty when you go you make your holiday broken I just say thet
I just can say don't book this hotel first room to old and to dirty and towel to bad klima don't work I say to many time nobody help and I book 5 monst before I say extra I nead twing bad nobody say we don't have and when I'm check in say soryy we not have twins bad but we can give you extra bad but this extra 300. 000 rupiah for just extra bad I'm not take 😂 because for extra money I take Ibis hotel extra room better breakfast better servis management not help and don't understand about work
Keep up the good service
Clean and quiet accommodation that is very well maintained and staffed. The pool area is so serene and beautiful. Breakfast is cooked to order and served to you in your room. Room is made up daily with the added touch of a lovely fragrance. I love it at De’lu!!
"Attentive staff that is quick to respond to your needs. Rooms cleaned daily. Tucked away in a very busy area, a real retreat."
"Best! villa sgt bersih, cuma part pool jelaa mcm kotor sebab pool mcm full of bacteria. pls ask from reception to clean it first before u enter ! cause i got itchiness after coming back from bali."
The villa is situated not too far from Seminyak and Canggu. Plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby the villa and there's a food market just right outside.
Breakfast is not as on the photos. It's cheaper and smaller version of this. It's dirty around private swimming pool (bird's poop) and the toilets not working properly.
"Not enough food places to eat
Great market nxt door"
"My room costs less than 20 $, but I got a marvelous duplex room with built-in garden on the veranda. Breakfast is served in the room and you can allocate the rime to have it.  Staff are very friendly with smiles. The room is extra large and can suit a big family with two floors in one room to linger around.  
A tiny and quiet swimming pool is at the back yielding privacy. 
I do love the place and will come back."
Lil bit disappointed cause when i booked the room on agoda they said have bathup and i paid more lil bit expensive. Cause i booked it for my friend for honeymoon. When we got there no one room have it. And water heater not working but they was fixed it. So far all good and my friends said staff friendly and they like it . Thanks
Me and my partner went here to spend 2 days in Seminyak but when we got the rooms the first thing we noticed was the smell of mold. The sheets were stained yellow and were dirty and soon after that we saw mold on the walls. The “windows” couldn’t be opened at the room was just so terrible that we had to move to another hotel. The staff were very friendly and tried their best but since they were fully booked we didn’t have any other choice but to change locations to a new hotel. Would not recommend this hotel.
Noisey location
"Suka banget sama view nya, kamar nya pun nyaman, kebetulan saya ambil yang garden view. Kolam renang bersih. Suasana tenang. Sarapan nya enak banget makanannya."
"Greeted by staff member and showed to villa. Small fruit plate and honey & ginger welcome drink on arrival. Villa is clean, sheets and towels are clean but a little stained. The villa and pool area are in need of a little maintenance. There is flaking paint in several places - maybe caused by damp or condensation. The villa is two story, one bedroom with extra single bed set up downstairs. There is a small private pool, and a toilet downstairs and bathroom upstairs .. a small pond in the living area under the stairs with 6 healthy coy fish. No kettle or milk/creamer sachet .. but coffee and tea?
Cutlery and Crockery for 2 not 3 .. easily fixed by asking. Breakfast orders off limited menu the evening before with time preference. 
No tea towel, cloth or soap in kitchen area and gas hob is out of order. No utensils or cooking equipment supplied. Available on request. 
Small fridge drink menu. (It’s a thoughtful touch to have a few supplies) There is no restaurant or room service."
"Nice location, nice helpful staff, but facilities need improving. Broken handles, tv, toilets and showers not all working or cleaned."
"The location was quite nice. Room was better than okay but not fabulous. The staff were okay. Some were very nice and friendly but my cousin overheard them speaking ill of me behind my back. I am not happy about that, and it made me feel uncomfortable the rest of my stay.
I also asked to extend my stay and they tried to triple the price point. I had to rebook online to remain the same price. 
Would have been an amazing stay other than the lack of hospitality from the staff."
"The room has 2 floors, equipped with kitchen. 1 toilet at the ground floor, 1 at first floor. very spacious. But the room and the private pool are not very clean. They provide free breakfast sending into the room in the morning, i ordered croissant but they gave me toast, anyway their scramble egg is very nice. It is acceptable to stay here for 1 night if you want a private pool, but dont expect much. 1 street away there are many nice restaurant, i went to a greek restaurant, super nice."
"The staff at the villa are very pleasant and friendly however I would like to point out some things. While it’s very cheap, I really shouldn’t expect too much but it would be nice if they would improve on the cleanliness of the room. I found some dust in my room, and it was hanging off the ceiling and there was some black mold above the shower. The breakfast was not great except for their egg omelette which was just okay. Their Indonesian dishes are terrible, you’re better off buying your own breakfast. And yes, their towels look so old and dirty. The pool was tiny, and the dock had some broken planks and I almost tripped. Other than, we will be back but we will get a different room."
"Booking 2 kamar seminyak room
- pintu kamar mandi yg 1 tidak bisa dikunci, pintu kamar mandi kamar kedua lebih parah tidak bisa ditutup sama sekali
- air kran cuci piring berbau besi
- sprei ranjang bau kain tidak kering
- menu sarapan variasinya sedikit sekali"
"-sewa 2 kamar seminyak room, pintu kamar mandi yg 1 tidak bisa dikunci yang satunya lagi malah ga bisa ditutup sama sekali.
- sprei tempat tidur bau kain tidak kering
- menu sarapan tidak variatif."
"We booked seminyak room which was written there with garden view but ended up having room upstairs which they claimed seminyak room with garden view had been fully utilized. They shouldn’t have been giving out the false information on website for customers to choose for if the rooms with garden view were actually been fully used. The room we got upstairs was having really dim light and the light in the bathroom was even not working for the first night. Luckily, the staff there was helpful to help me fix that for the other night otherwise I would probably need to get shower in dark for two nights there. The breakfast there was nice you get to choose and they’ll send it to you in the morning but other than that the pool is small and it’s far away from our rooms upstairs so we didn’t get to use it during the mean time. Room is clean just that we’re disappointed for not getting the room we booked."
"This is the first ever non-positive review . I cannot comment on the whole villa but on the room I stayed. The bathroom was stinking, and had roaches, lizard and small worms. The garden view door lock was broken. I told them but I have not seen any improvement. They did the temporary fix for the door but regretted the stay due to the stinking smell of the bathroom. I would not recommend the room for any one."
"Nice breakfast, friendly staff, have bike and car rental. Near city centre and beside it have a small market."
The private pool is the best! Small but very nice place to stay with family.
There is a warung infront of this villa! The food is bomb. This place is near all the place you want to visit around seminyak.
