Column 1
"Everything is as described and shown in photos.  Yes, it’s really that beautiful in Kintamani. Service is excellent. Although every male staff member will question if you’re alone because it’s not common for women to travel alone here but I definitely felt safe. 
 I brought all of my own food as recommended by a friend who stayed so I can’t review that part. I cooked over an open fire which I loved. Bring all of your own cooking supplies if you plan on doing that. Water heater for the shower was top notch. It’s a simple futon style mattress but it was fine for me because bedding was still nice. If you’re two, ask for extra. If you’re planning on spending the afternoon in the cabin be prepared it might get warm because of the large window, again didn’t bother me. There are Bluetooth speakers in the room but the quality isn’t up to my standard but I’m picky with that stuff and brought my own Bose. If you want to rent their projector bring adapter for usb to usb-c if using Mac.
Only complaint which has nothing to do with them, are the flies. Like crazy amount all day and there’s nothing you can do about it. So I didn’t sit still outside longer than 2 minutes. I’m also an expert now at killing them inside. Bring a swatter."
Best view all the ways around even from the room. The bathroom was clean and the hot water works. Though the wifi broke all day and the locked sometimes didn't work
"The location is AWESOME, the cabin is really comfortable but the highlight is the view. Waking up to sunrise over the lake is just breathtaking. Word of advice, travel to this place in daylight as night drive can be both challenging and dangerous. The staffs are super helpful. We checked in really late but we were still provided with some meal choices. Would definitely return for more days here…"
"Nice view, smart house, staff are friendly and very kind of, will comeback again"
"Please to have more hint for locations and to repair the road, its too small and bad road"
"OMG, THIS PLACE IS A STUFF OF DREAMS
THIS PLACE IS LIKE HEAVEN ON EARTH
OMG, THIS PLACE IS JUST GORGEOUS
ALL SERVICES ARE DONE ONLINE AND DIGITALLY VIA AN APP.
PAYMENT FOR ROOM SERVICE CAN ONLY BE DONE USING A CREDIT CARD.
JUST, WOW!"
"I love my stay here!!! Definitely will come back again soon!
I am so in love with this place. 🥹"
Keep up the great works
everything is great! what could be better would be the food and coffee
"Such a peaceful place. Booked the cabin with hot tub. Was there for 2 nights and did literally nothing and it was the best ever. Had a really good sleep with no disturbance. Was super relaxing. Just that in the morning around 10-1pm it will be hot in the cabin and aircon isnt quite cold BUT they had put up a notice on the door itself. So it was very thoughtful of them. 
Loving the night weather soooooo much which was around 14-16 degrees celcius! Thank you Bobocabin! Me and my little family loves it so much!"
"Great place to find peace with a beautiful view. Pictures on here are accurate. 
Finding the place might be a slight problem as the inner “roads” arent on google map or most other maps. Do come via the lake side instead of through the mountains. Once there, nothing much is accessible (food drinks). The food they provide is decent but not cheap. Bring your own towels. After sunrise, the cabins can get rather warm. Definitely would return here!"
"I love everything about this place, although the location was a little bit remote from the main road, and to get here was difficult.
But still love the concept. The electric system to operate some facilities went down for hours, and the technician was called from far, that's why it kinda took forever to fix it.
Overall, would love to experience with bobocabin :)"
The best view
So happy to be there. Thanks
Best place to stay
"It’s a simple accommodation. Superb wifi. But the view of mt agung and the cooling weather, just makes everything worth while."
Everything is good except the track to get there. Its narrow only for one car and the road is not proper. But it has nice view and unique experience for staying
"Beautiful view! Cleaned cabin and good outdoor walk. Wish they can serve better inhouse meals, it will be more satisfied 😅🤩"
"This place was amazing. It was a little difficult to find. Be careful of Google Maps. If you're on a bike, no problem. We took a car and google toon us to a road that's too small. 
The place had an amazing view. B
Bring your own food."
"(+) 
The views and tech are great✨
There is a common area located at the end of the property both outdoor (bean bags) and indoor (house with lot of books, microwaves, freezer, refrigerator).. you can reheat your food and eat here if you want to keep your room clean
It’s only 2km++ from toya devasya
(-)
The access to the property from the main road is bad and small (one car sized only). It’s like riding off-road especially when raining
The flies!!! Immediately close the door after you open it!
The food is kinda pricey considering the portions"
"The location is pretty secluded, the road need to be worked on. BUT, it was beautiful, the cabin, the atmosphere the staff. really what an experience, would recommend all of you to stay here. 9.5/10"
Over all good but not for the track!
"Super nice views and cool weather. Great facilities, make sure you use the bon fire. Access and Driving there can be challenging. Apart from that, it's a new experience you need to try."
Best vieww ever!
"Everything is perfect
Except the way to the location need someone to take care of the traffic from up and below.."
"Good place with good view, but the food to pricey maybe because its far from nearest food stall. Also the access is little bit small if u using big car is bit tricky. But overall this is good place for staying in kintamani"
"Overlooking Batur Lake and Mountain, it has the best view. Once you're there, it's hard to go around because the road to go there is a dirt road and it's far from decent restaurant. The cabin itself needs some maintenance. Water from shower overflowing to outside shower door. Matress is hard and pillows are too thin."
"The view was the best part. The location was great because of the view, but to get there can be a hassle. It seemed they weren't expecting foreigners as their app that to access the cabins & facilities needed a local number to register. The staff however were helpful to assist through the registration and gave a local number to use. Since it was so secluded, it was expected that the kitchen would be fully stocked but when we ordered dinner, most of the food on the menu that was published on their social media weren't  available. It was still a great experience overall."
Good view.. Amazing experience and cozy😍👍
"The staff and facilities are very good, actually access to this place not so difficult but rocky and just a one way road. Even so, I love this place!"
Overall it was a wonderful stay in a beautiful place. I love the compact design of the cabin with many electricity charger. The features also very sophisticated. Just 1 minus point about the food. We pay for high price for the food but the taste was just average or even not meeting our expectation.
"Supposedly if the hotel doesn't want to pave access to the hotel, at least the Bobocabin hotel sign must be CLEAR so that people don't get lost, especially at night. the road to Bobocabin is very terrible.
The floor of the room was very dirty, I'm pretty sure it wasn't swept before. No hotel slippers even I have to use mine inside.
But overall the view is really beautiful."
Yes it was great view but it seem a lillte lack of fun activities e.g pool or child facility. Of course the insiden cabin facility was hi tech but as long as we stay we only stay in cabin because no other facility we can use. And it's far from anywhere.. Other that that it was okay
"beautiful scenery, clean room, road is bumpy and narrow on the way in"
"The location is little bit hidden and the road is not that good, but its a nice place to relax and far from city"
"Good for all 
Minus byk lalat"
"Need more upgrade for the access
Many flies and insects when summer
I recommend you to book cabin 1 to 3, get the best access to the view point and kitchen."
"Stay was great, though it is much colder than I expected (even without a/c on). 
Futon is ok but duvet could be fluffier and warmer. Bathroom was clean, good hot water shower. Wifi worked well. Friendly staff.
The drawback is unavailable chat facility prior check in. We had difficulty finding the location n requesting room assignment. Both phone numbers on google n boboapps were not contactable. We went after sunset; Google map lead us to dirt road, with no clear sign to reach location.  Luckily we met a local store owner, who was kind enough guiding us with his motorbike to the site."
"I will start with what's good about this place: the view. They're located above the Danau Batur so we have a solid mesmerizing sight of both mountain and the lake. 
But, there are a lot of factors that made me reconsider to revisit this place; 
The cabin itself, was made with this 'triplek' material, and the genteng is made with Seng(Metal materials) which ABSORB HEAT. I could not stay inside the cabin from 11am-4pm. It was very HOT inside the cabin, almost like a Sauna. I am sure the architecture team has great vision and design, but, oh well, with that materials they chose to built, that place is not the best option to have a staycation. Anyway, because of the heat, we decided to chill out in the outside patio, but, the FLIES are unbearable. The Autan/ repellent did not help. It was not a comfortable place to relax outside. We couldn't enjoy ourselves from 11am- 4 pm. 
The selection of food they offer us was not the best either, and it's hard for us to buy food outside cause of the location. 
We can only communicate (for room service, etc) with the staff through this Chat in their Apps, which also a bit of bummer, they did not always respond right away.  Not the best customer service experience, considering the amount that we paid that was not cheap.
We were suppose to stay for 3 nights, but we decided to just stay for 2 nights because of the experience. They were not the most flexible for rescheduling/ refund either, since they said the system is ""centralized"", we didn't get a refund for our 1 night earlier check out. 
I'd say if you choose to stay here, 1 night is probably enough."
The view was amazing with lake and moubtain from your bed. But you can enjoy it only from 5 pm till 8 am cus the air condition cant bear the temperature outside. By the time you check in (2 pm) the cabin is so dang hot you cant stay inside.
"The room is bigger than a capsule hotel. In the morning, there are flies everywhere. The mgmt should put a net outside the door to reduce the likely the flies will get in."
Room feels tiny.  Tons of flies in the morning.
"Room is very small. 
Not included breakfast and no ride hail food merchants around. End up we pay nearly one third more. 
If you used to have wide room hotels, maybe this one not suit."
"The view was beautiful and it was very instagrammable 
But the facilities were extremely basic. 
It was too dangerous to drive at night through the rocky terrain to go anywhere so you’re stuck there, and the menu is basic you can only sit in your cabin there’s nothing else to do and also there is “quiet time” between 9pm - 7am which is excellent. However none of the surrounding villas or accommodation have this rule and we were kept up till past 1am with a ginormous party and you can’t even have a lay in because there is no option to black out your cabin there is only a white screen or no screen so when the sun is up so are you! Also it got uncomfortably hot in the cabin in the morning and only way to cool it down was to open the door and that let all the flys in to which there was an abundance of!"
"it looked wow because of new place, nice view and smart technology.
The road to reach the place was rough (google maps will bring you the wrong way for sure)
Once you arrive, need to download cabinbox app (everything will do by yourself via this app; check-in, QR code key, to order food, to talk with staff, even control the lights in your room on your smartphone).
The cabin was too tiny, just for 2 person!!! the family cabin for 4, it could not bring your luggages in the cabin.
The water heater was too too hot, I could not take a shower because of damn hot and uncontrallable.
and the last important thing, I need their help because I booked the wrong date, the staff forced me to pay for new booking, I did not expect them to refund my money, but I never see even a little help or try to help or contact someone to help. No more this place.
And food was terrible I ever had in Bali."
"Located in a beautiful area of kintamani, however the road access to the premise are terrible and scary
The cabin with modern concept, but become an oven during sunny day time.
There are a lot of flies and insect in the area.
During my stay there are someone who always play drone surrounding our unit, really spoil our privacy"
Cabins are super cute and that’s about it. Bed was a thin uncomfortable mattress may have been just sleeping on the floor. Bugs were so bad I got so many bites. Also the cabin window is cool but it gets sooo hot with the sun you can’t even stay in the cabin. Do not recommend.
"Good location, very quiet and beautiful."
Nice modern cabins with great features. Best thing is having a full bathroom and the smart glass window to an amazing view. Hot tub was perfect to chill after a long day
"Love the technology there, and it’s so thoughtful to put up the mosquitoes nets surrounding small coffee table outside and inside the cabin. Although the place is undeniably occupied by certain insects such as worm, snails, spiders, beetle etc, it’s indeed worth the money to experience the true “camper life”."
"Stay in bobocabin kintamani is really different from other acomodations :)
The location is nearby the Lake Batur, so we can enjoy the landscape both lake and mountain which are really beautiful. The facilities mostly cover up, besides they provide BBQ’s stuff and bonfire equipment, so we can enjoy the night more warmly with family or friends.
One thing is really matter, since the location in Kintamani, we can find many flies in the cabin area, this is normal in Kintamani but quite distrubing"
Need improvement on staff quality in terms of helping and customer satisfaction.
"Such an incredible experience : worth the adventure to get there. 
would highly recommend to stay in cabin 1 or 2 as they seem to have the ideal views."
"Worth to try for once in a lyfe experience in Bali.. 
+ Small cabin but feel homey
+ Great view
- There's limited choices for F&B and most of them sold out. 
- Be careful there's lots of flies
- Bad access road to get here
- smelly pillow and dirty bed
- dirty amenities
- slow staff coz we communicate thru apps"
"Location far enough around 30 mins (by car) from crowded places (cafes). To reach the place, it’s recommended to travel by car because online transportation (bike/car) haven’t exist yet. The available food was not really good/decent and not too many options. If you stay more than 1 night, bring your own food and snack. The weather was extremely hot from 8 am to 4 pm, bring something to cover the window."
Very recommend. Worth with the money
"We really love the scenery and the new experience staying in a sophisticated cabin. Apps is used for opening the access to our room, to control the window, the music, the lights, the mood lights. It was a new experience for us to stay in a cabin by the lake and the mountain. 
Five of us stayed in Bobocabin. We booked a deluxe room with hot tub for 2 and a Family Room for 4 people even though only three people stayed there. I and my husband got the cabin number 4, the view from our window was so amazing. We could see the beautiful sunrise, also we could see the night view with the lights of the cars passing by. However, our children who got Cabin number 30 couldn’t see as beautiful scenery as what we have in Cabin number 4 because it was blocked by a pine tree. Therefore, five of us always gathered in Cabin Number 4. 
So if you (Reader/s) are going to stay in Bobocabin make sure you order a Cabin with a hot tub. I observed that cabins number 1-5 are great.
There were a lot of positive points staying in Bobocabin, the beautiful scenery, fresh air, peaceful situation, nice hot tub, a lot of photo spots.  The barbeque dinner was good. 
On the other hands there were several areas of improvements that they should do: the fascinating huge glass window that we can see beautiful scenery could be equipped with an automatic blind or layered with UV proof stickers, this is due to the fact that from 9’oclock the sun shines so brightly that makes the room so hot. They should think of a system to shoo the flies away. Too many flies that made the stay uncomfortable. The lunch taste was not that good and they gave very small portions of dishes (lauknya sedikit banget). 
The best time staying there was from six o’clock in the evening until 8 o;clock in the morning. The best time to view the sunries is from five thirty. 
Overall, it was a wonderful experience to stay near the nature in a sophisticated cabin."
"Not sure how people can give this place a 5 star review, that's utter crazy. 
The signage to find the hotel have trees Infront, so keep looking carefully or you will drive straight passed  the turn off. 
Our Room lights kept turning them self on all night every 20minutes during the night automatically, the speakers in the room had a static noise which we couldn't turn off, the worse part is the bed is hard like a rock, now I've slept on some hard beds before but this is next level hard. If you need a firm to soft bed you won't sleep comfortably here., The room heats up by 10am and the AC can't keep up. There's way too many flies and you can't sit outside until it's night time.
I Definitely wouldn't class this as glamping"
Please make it the better road to access the place
"Beautiful view, excellent service, definitely come back for next time. Please ask locals for directions , a bit confusing but its worth it ."
Smart system is engaging and made stay more unique
Cabin in the valley great for healing!
"Great  view! The place is clean also the staff is helpful, everything is easy to operate. Also value for money, but the access to the cabin is pretty rough. But all is good!"
"Breathtaking view, everything through apps you have to download it, staff not friendly but the location is perfect"
"Access to lacation is very bad, but the hotel is very nice view."
Keren Cmn pagi panas jd cpt check out
"The road is bumpy especially for small car, not a good access. The room temperature is cool at night and very hot at the morning to afternoon (maybe it should improve). The cabin staff is friendly"
"We arrived at Bobocabin late night, around 9pm.
It was a nightmare getting here as the roads aren't proper, but its super worth it when you've reached.
The customer service here is wonderful, and they try their best to be quick.
You'll have to download an app called Bobobox in order to check in. 
Food here is super good too!"
"from night to morning its wonderfull. but from morning, OMG its so hot. like chicken in the oven 🥲"
The access to the stay is quite harsh but overall recommended stay.
Good job !
"The only thing good in here is the view and implementation of tech even though quite not necessary but this tech only for show case.
Pros:
+ staff are nice
+ view is amazing
Cons:
- Access to this place is so terrible, not well maintained. Even the road is only one way and super steep hill, so you need to wait other car to pass before you but if you are in the middle and meet with other cars, one of you need to move backward.
- the room looks not maintained well, dirt, dust and mold anywhere. If you take look on air-con, it is soo dusty not good for your health.
- A lot of insects/bugs, flies everywhere really not hygiene place."
"Place is very nice. Rooms are up to Bobo standards. Just a bit hard to reach given its location. 
Don’t follow Google Maps/Waze’s directions. As you get closer there will be signs to guide you to the location - follow these instead."
Best view!
Nice place bobocabin
"Staffnya baik, kamar oke, pemandangan fantastis. Akses jalan tolong di perbaiki. Ekstrim sekali jalan menuju sana."
Kabin yang modern dan bersih
"Kebersihannya saya kaish nilai 1 dari 5. Saya menginap di hot tub..hot tub nya banyak lumut, pengisian air panasnya terlalu lama 7-8 jam."
"Liburan bersama keluarga,ditempat yang sejuk dan tenang,dengan kabin yang canggih dan bisa melihat pemandangan danau batur yang cantik,malam hari bisa memandang bintang dan membuat api unggun sambil bakar sosis dan marshmallow luar biasa🥰😍"
"Jalan menuju hotel parah, d tempat tidur dan kamar mandi banyak binatang dr lalat, nyamuk, lintah, ulet, bekicot, trus jam 8-10 pagi, matahari tembus ke kamar dan panas sekali, makanan standar dan lumayan mahal ..
Ini yang pertama dan terakhir buat saya inap d sini..
Pantesan ga bisa batal dr awal, ternyata parah kondisi nya"
"Fasilitas sangat lengkap, kamar nyaman dan bersih
Jalan menuju ke lokasi lumayan menegangkan"
Akses jalan yg agak sulit untuk mobil pendek
Kurangnya jalan yang baik untuk konsemun
"Pemandangannya indah🥰 makanannya enak, staf ramah dan sangat membantu. Karena Saya bersama anak usia 4 thn 10 bulan, jadi berbekal mainan kesini biar gak bosan☺️"
"Untuk jalan akses sedikit susah di temukan, mohon lebih diperbaiki akses dan kemudahan ke bobocabin kintamani"
Rekomen untuk group travelling dan view yang bagus
"Pemandangan ok, sayang di kamar terlalu panas jika pagi hari, tidak ada blind utk tutup jendela.
Fasilitas sedikit, di common area tidak ada sabun cuci piring, dll.
Akses jalan masuk tidak bagus, ada 2 akses jgn pilih yang lebih dekat"
"akses jalan yg buruk, makanan yg berbau, tidak menyenangkan menginap disini"
"Keseluruhan ok banget.. Bakal balik lagi kesini buat healing..
cuma diluar kabin, lalatnya berjamaah juga ikut healing 😂,,yah harap maklum namanya juga di alam.."
"Kami salah lewat jalan, karena baru plg dr ulun danu bedugul. Jd dilewatin gunung atas. Wow jalannya luar biasa sempit dan berbatu. Tp untungnya warga situ baik banget mau nganterin, jd kami sampai dengan selamat walupun jantung masih berdegub kencang krn akses jalan yg kami lewati salah. Hahaha. 
Utk cabinnya oke banget. Bersih, tp kalo siang PANASSSS BGT. Sebaliknya, kalo malem DINGIN BGTTT. Tp overall asiiikk bgttt kesini, tempatnya tenang, nyaman dan bersih. Yg bikin deg2an lg karena ini posisinya diantara 2 gunung aktif, kami sempat ngerasain gempa bbrp detik. Mereka siapkan helm safety buat kalo tbtb ada hal gk terduga. Oiya, kami nyoba bbq dan bikin api unggun. Seru bgtt berasa kaya camping beneran. Sukak bgttt pokoknyaaa 💙💙💙💙💙💙 MAKASIH BOBOCABIN !!"
"Jalan menuju lokasi penginapan ny masih jelek, tapi puas setelah sampai di atas di yempat bobocabin nya. Pemandangannya Ok banget."
"Apalagi yg bawa mobil kecil. Harus hati2, jalan hanya untuk 1 mobil. Bisa 2 mobil tp agak maksa. Tapiiii, ga nyesel kalo uda sampai bobocabin. Pengalaman menginap yg berbeda!"
"Walaupun sempet nyasar, tapinsetelah menghubungi pihak hotel, mereka langsung jemput dan memandu ke hotel, pemandangannya bagussss bangeeett, cabinnya bersih dan semua fasilitas berfungsi dengan baik, tapi air di cabin saya kurang panas hanya hangat saja"
"1. Overall untuk kamar sangat bagus dan partial teknologi kontrol dipakai di dalamnya seperti jendela yang bisa di kontrol menggunakan gadget pribadi
2. Jangan lupa download aplikasi bobocabin untuk memudahkan proses dari check in, di kamar hingga check out,,,makanan pun bisa order lewat aplikasi ini
3. Pintu harus selalu tertutup ya karena banyak sekali lalat di sekitar area ini
4. Pemandangan atau viewnya danau batur yang sangat indah
5. Staff ramah"
"Bangun pagi suasana dingin, pemandangan bagus ada danau gunung, ada orang lg menyiram kebun"
"Bobocabin ini viewnya indah, terutama saat sunrise. Cabin juga bersih, modern, nyaman.
Landscape juga oke, stafnya helpful.
very recommended."
"View ok, fasilitas ok, staf ramah, makanan enak. Hanya saja akses jalannya perlu diperbaiki agar lebih aman."
Sangat indah
"Akses masuk agak sulit. Hanya bs 1 mobil dan jalannya masih berbatu. Kamar minimalis ok. Tp panas banget kalau siang, karena kacanya gede dan ga ada tirai. Malam dingin sekali dan selimutnya kurang tebal.."
"Bobocabin punya pemandangan yg sangat bagus. Udara juga dingin, hanya saja banyak lalat disiang hari"
Sayang nya jalan nya masih jelek masuk ke dalam banyak lobang dan terjal
Perjalanan jauh dari pusat kota ke Kintamani terobati setelah sampai di hotel. Pemandangannya bagus. Cabinnya dilengkapi teknologi canggih.
"Kalau cari pemandangan yang indah vibes seperti di luar negri cocok banget dateng ke sini bener2 indahbbanget, cuma sayang nya jendela kamar, kusen nya kotor berdebu seperti tidak pernah dibersihkan, saya yg rekam jd males upload karna berdebu banget"
"Tempat bagus, view bagus. Respon pelayanan cepat.
Hanya banyak lalat diwaktu siang. Tp cabin sudah ada pintu serangga. Tks"
Kalau ke sini pake mobil tinggi saja. Jalannya sempit. Dan paling pas kalau sore hari. Pagi hari pemandangannya kurang dan tertutup kabut
"tolong jalanannya segera di benerin, aksesnya susah banget, makan juga mahal banget"
Cocok sekali utk pasang yg mau honeymoon atau yg suka tempat sepi jauh dari keramaian enk sejuk tempatnya
Berkesan
"The room is not soft, feels like sleeping in front. The food is not fresh and lots of flies if you eat outside. But all that is quite replaced with cool air, beautiful scenery."
"gelasnya masih kotor, berdebu juga layar podnya"
Banyak lalat dan siang hari panas
"Bobocabin view bagus banget, cuman memang arah jalan ke tempat nya yang masih kecil dan sempit, overall pemandangan, kebersihan, pelayanan luar biasa. Dengan aplikasi bobobox kita bisa komunikasi dengan pihak hotel untuk pesan makanan dll."
Banyak LALAT
"Harga standard. Pemandangan bagus. Teknologi di cabin ok. Akses ke tempatnya agak sulit tapi msh oke lah. Anak2 happy. Saran saya bawa makanan sendiri krn kalau sudah sampai, males keluar lagi. Harga makanan di sana agak pricey."
Reccomended
"Saya menginap dengan 2 anak dewasa dan 1 anak usia 11 tahun.  Booking 1 cabin. Satu cabin dengan fasilitas Hottub
Tetapi Hottub tidak bisa dipakai karena tidak penuh-penuh, disekeliling rumput tinggi sehingga banyak nyamuk
Untuk cabin satu lagi kamar mandi bocor sehingga air kemana-mana
Pada saat pagi matahari langsung karena tidak ada gordyn black out sinar matahari langsung menjadikan ruangan panas dan terang"
"Tempatnya bagus facilitas juga bagus, air panasnya banyak jadi puas mandi walau dingin, kekurangannya itu jalan menuju penginapan masih kurang diperhatikan, jalan kecil, tapi rata-rata tamu yg nginep pake mobil jalannya juga jelek banyak lubang, boleh kali ya persatuan pemilik vila di daerah jalan song dikit perbaiki jlan menuju penginapan karna bukan cma bibocabin aja yg dstu banyak glamping juga daerah stu, staff juga ramah dan sangat membantu, rekomendasi pokoknya. Oh ia untuk makanan menurut saya agak susah cari di daerah bawah karna bobo cabjn di kintamani bagian bawah dan cafe2 atau resto itu rata2 di bagian atas"
"Terasa sangat panas di pagi hari karna sinar matahari, ac pun tidak terasa dingin. 
Bagus semua sih... tapi akses jalan lumayan sulit 😁"
View cantik gila walaupun jalan nak masuk dalam ni sangat mencabar tapi berbaloi la.. sila datang..
"Bagus. Aksesnya lumayan gampang, tapi ada jalan sedikit rusak ketika mau nyampe ke cabinnya, dan juga terlalu banyak lalat."
