"Recently stayed at the hotel and really enjoyed it. Friendly, polite and responsive staff, very clean rooms and the property in general, great pool, restaurant and cafe on the premises. Some of the room features are a little bit outdated but still very clean. Room service every day. Buffet breakfast is amazing, we counted up to 34 different dishes from hot foods like stir fries, hot meat dishes, different types of eggs/omelets made to order, pancakes, waffles, danishes, fruits, youghurts, toasts, juices and coffees/tees. There's a mini-bus every 15 minutes taking guests to the beach and back. I wouldn't say the beach is a walking distance, it's do-able in maybe 20mins but better to ride in the mini-bus than walk in the heat. There're water activities offered at the beach, at a cost. Also a really good massage at about $15 for an hour. And a bar.  Plus you can buy a coconut for $3 next door. Money exchange service on premises at very competitive rates. Kids club and a free photograph (photo session) which needs to be booked.  If you're in Bali just to chill by the pool or the beach, this is the place. you don't need to go anywhere, just chillax!! Thank you, we really enjoyed staying at this property and will recommend to friends and family."
"Stayed 4 nights in Novotel Nusa Dua, the first two nights we booked Deluxe pool view, but we only can see the corner of the pool. We spoke to the bell boy and he helped to sort out the problem by calling the receptionist. And they responded so quickly arranged another room with the pool view, really appreciate it. The next 2 nights we booked the 2 bedroom with the gazebo and swimming pool, it was amazing. The kids loved it, the room is spacious, the pool, the gazebo and everything was lovely. The location is so close to the airport, many restaurant near the hotel, And the beach is so beautiful and clean, white sands and there is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the beach. Definitely recommended and will be back again next time. Thank you to all Novotel Nusa Dua staff."
"This property is situated at Nusa Dua beach, they have an excellent private beach. Room service is good. Real resort property in a posh gated locality where all other big branded hotels are situated. Yes, but if you have to party then it’s far from the party places of the town.
Over all excellent stay!!"
Nice play to stay. Foods are tasty. Only the room a bit old and the door kinda broken. Amenities also not complete. But overal it was a nice experience staying here
"We were there for 1 night and we were lucky to be upgraded to a 3 bedroom villa. The rooms are nice and spacious, the hotel renovation is a bit old, but we spent a good time there."
"Nice stay at Hotel, only thing to suggest is that more night pole lights are to be installed at parks"
"Good hotel facilities, great food ( breakfast ) nice landscape pool...great place to relax your mind and soul. 
Disadvantages not many choices food ( for muslim) but still can do food delivery....will come back to novotel"
"Great hotel, we had kids from 10 months to 11 years old.
Kids club is amazing, they do so much other than keep them in a room. Staff are very attentive and the area is great.
Actually can't fault it at all."
"Room was amazing, facilities were really good. Staff was courteous, breakfast buffet was really good only recommendation is to add a few more hot dish for breakfast. Location was close to beach and restaurants. 
Only thing that I can point out was air condition in the room was not working very well."
Great place to stay in Bali.  Very quiet with great pool and facilities.  Rooms are as in photos and generously sized.  Great staff too
"Always great to visit, I love staying in Nusa Dua.  Staff and people are nice a friendly, I’ll be back soon"
"Nice place, location, service, and environment, perfect for holiday."""
Close to beaches and everything you need in and around hotel.
Food not that good but the rest is good
"Breakfast was good 
We all sleep well after our daily recreation
Thanks Agoda & Novotel Nusa Dua."
"This place is worth the price, the place is spacious plus you got private beach"
Rooms big . Staff helpful and friendly . Food fantastic and Spa Girls are awesome and do a great job. Highly recommend Novotel to any fellow travelers be it couples/ families or singles
Nice place for staycation in Bali. Food is nice
"We booked 2 rooms that are side by side. I have confirmed through the phone, and when we went there days before checking in.
However the front desk said no side by side room. So in compliment the next day they moved us to the 2BR villa. it was lovely, with the big kitchen. very suitable for family with kids.  Thanks to Ms. Rara. The beach was great in nusa dua, children can swim comfortably"
Perfect location to play golf in Nusa Dua
Perfect location to play golf in Nusa Dua
We had a great time staying in this hotel
"Very nice facility and friendly, helpful staff. Good for enjoying the resort. The location is good for exploring the south of Bali."
Good location
Spacious room and beautiful private beach you should check it out. Will coming back for sure
"I stayed here for 7 days in apartment 3 bedroom, im check in hotel at 15.30 wib but the unit not be ready. the rooms are old but its okay, maybe need a remodeling , i got had terrible bathroom in the main room the wastafel / clogged sink. The pool small but clean & enough."
"A grade with the private beach
B+ grade with breakfast. 
A grade with all staffs friendly & kind.
A grade with pool
B grade with pool bar
recommend if you head to Nusa dua with around usd 100 per 1 night"
"It was a nice day to celebrate my birthday. Less crowd, loved the shuttle going to the beach."
"The towels that were given on the beach weren't clean, my wife and I was bitten by flea;
the small pillows in the living room were smelly. But other than that, everything was good. They even allow me to adjust my booking due to unexpected situation of corona outbreak."
"Great location in a quiet safe area.  Pools are great.  The gardens are stunning.  The rooms are very tired and need a make over, however they are very clean.  The staff are great and always happy to help."
"This is the 2nd time I stayed - first time solo, and the 2nd time with my family. 
Lack of direct access to the beach is the downside of this location. There is a shuttle every 15 minutes, but it's much better to have beach in the walking distance."
"It was ok stay - noting really bad but nothing exciting. The room and bathroom were lovely. Nice calm colours and comfy bed. Bathroom nice and big. The breakfast was not good. No gluten free options unless you order the day before. Ordered banana pancakes - the day before, when my breakfast came it was two tiny pancaked and when flipped it it was burned. I would not stay as a couple again. Good for families. 
Staff were lovely, helpful and friendly. Nice but as I said nothing too exciting."
No hot water in shower
"with price the place is oke. but keep requested things.  beach need to take shuttle.  
nice staff hotel ."
"Need to improve staff hospitality, cleanliness and facilities"
"The room has a decent size and is clean. Pool is nice and large. Breakfast is decent, though it lacks of variety. Location is good, close to the beach, restaurants and shops. Their private beach club is just 10-min walk and can also be reached by their shuttle service that drives there and vice-versa every 15 minutes. However, the staff were disappointing. They could have been friendlier, more helpful and more knowledgeable. The staff in blue shirt seemed untrained and avoid any contact with guests; no greetings, no smile. The receptionists are often unaware and neglecting to show hospitality when the guests show up at the front desk and ask for assistance. I stayed at the one-bedroom suite for three nights and had an issue with the room key since day one. Every single time I left the room, they key card just didn't work anymore and I had to ask them either to provide a new key card or to help me open the door. The receptionists were aware of the issue since day one, however, they offered to check and fix the door lock on the last day of my stay. Welcome drink was served at the pool bar and it took ages for them to serve it. Hygienic rule at the restaurant needs to be improved. I saw the staff didn't clean the table properly. The beach club is not so bad, but the beach area is very small and there are very few palm trees which barely provide any shade. Though they provide beach umbrellas, under certain weather conditions (like during my stay) you can't use the umbrellas. So you will have no protection from the sun and the rain. For the price you pay, it's hard to recommend this hotel. However, it is still a nice hotel. If you are traveling to Bali and you will most likely spend a lot of time outside the hotel, this could be a good option as none of those small issues would matter to you. Or if you are traveling with kids, this property could be perfect for you as they have a nice kids club, kids pool, and even kids garden. Otherwise, you might want to consider other"
lovely hotel with quiet surrounding
Good resorts in budget and good breakfast options.
"Tier 2 or 3 hotels in Nusa Dua, as it’s not next to the ocean and hotel is quite old. However the staff are very helpful and friendly. Love everyone’s greetings and smiles on the way."
Can be cleaner
"We thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and found all the staff friendly and welcoming. Some aspects of the resort and our room are looking a bit tired, but was expected after post COVID .
We have been traveling to the Novotel Benoa for the past 15 years, an so this was a different experience with it also being a residency."
"The hotel was nice, however it would be great if NOVOTEL improve their cleanliness... Staffs were so nice and kind"
"This hotel was only ""okay"" to me.  Prices are very high for such an outdated establishment.  The staff were amazing, but the facilities are mediocre.  Breakfast buffet can be better and more coffee machines are needed...only 2 cups can be made at one time! My room smelled musty; as if it's not been used for a while or aired out."
"Not a bad hotel but the staff have no idea what everyone else is doing, we paid for our meals in cash as we were only staying 24 hours and then they kept us at reception on check out for over 30 mins as they had no record of us paying for lunch 24 hours before and kept asking us for our receipt from lunch, absolutely useless, no departments talk to each other and their computer system is from the 90's, 1 star"
"Took 4 hours+ and numerous calls to get baby cot and water. I guess they are not really 100% staffed or at least not all staff are experienced/ good in English. 
Found lots of sands inside the private pool. Should have cleaned the plastic cover on top of the private pool to make it more attractive. It is now full of wild plants perhaps Mold too. 
Kid club is dated and doesn’t seem too attractive. 
No toothbrush provided and only one floor mate is provided where the washroom is huge and easily get wet everywhere."
"Pros: can handle big groups, meeting, gathering, quick services
Cons: old hotel and facilities, breakfast not many to choose and taste so- so. Hotel bicycle is not free. Location bit far to walk anywhere interesting"
After a troublesome check in which took over 1 1/2 hrs  ie The NOVOTEL b
"Large rust stains on the marble , shower knobs are worn out.
Larger Salad serving Plate at the counter needs to be used for better presentation .
Beef and chicken sausage quite bland"
i was very disappointed by the staff at the hotel they did not respond well to the problem. i called the receptionist and she transferred the call to her supervisor she said but in the end no one answered. i keep calling but no one wants to be responsible and the solution to the problem is i have to take shower at the other room in DIFFERENT BUILDING!  the reception said ohhh u just take the shower and come back to your room. how sick is that? please guys dont ever think about staying here.
"The receptionist when checking in was not wearing her mask correctly. 
We have to wait just about 1 hour for the room, even though we arrived after the advertised check in time."
The bed is stinks
"First hotel which I complaint and in the need of changing room. Though the hotel is old, I'm fine with it as long as the room is well maintained. Here is my experience for two nights:
1. The service is a little bit slow especially at night. During peak season only 1 front desk staff available at midnight (no porter).
2. The room is old, with dim lighting, broken door knob, broken air conditioning in main bedroom, broken pipe in main bathroom bedroom, broken bidet in second bathroom, room not smell good.
The good one is the staff listened to my complaint and change my room to teo deluxe rooms at night and upgrade to three bedroom at second night.
Though the experience is not good and not recommened, I hope the hotel could renovate the rooms, especially the old elevator which is really old and hotter than the air outside.
The front desk service is luckily good (maybe because I complained) but they give me faster response."
"This hotel is beautiful, their staff is amazing, and the environment is great. It is more for families with children; they have a kids club, sports by the water, activities, etc. So, if you are a couple and you would like some quiet time, this is not a place for you. We found the pool very noisy...but the beach club is more quiet, and the views are stunning. 
The hotel room was extremely humid, more than other hotels we have tried in Bali. Put your clothes to dry at the balcony area.
The hotel says it's smoke free, but this is not true. People smoke everywhere, even by the children's play areas. Very annoying when you are allergic and you choose this hotel because it's advertised as smoke free :(
The food is delicious, but expensive. There are plenty of eating places around, so ... 
The beach club is very nice. We did not like that they allowed non hotel guests to use the facilities for a price. There is a sign that says the facilities are only for hotel guests, but if you pay the guys there, you get a sun bed, towels, and access to food, toilets and shower. Not 5 star standard. 
The hotel has very good shower facilities by the coffee club. If your flight is late at night, like ours, you can check out, store your luggage at the reception, use all the hotel facilities for the day, including the beach club, and then use the shower facilities before leaving the hotel.
We used the hotel airport transfer both ways. There are cheaper options, but it was much easier to arrange directly with the hotel than having to bargain with the multiple Nusa Dua taxi drivers around. They can be quite pushy and argumentative. 
To and from the beach club, use the hotel shuttle...very frequent. To Bali collection (shopping and eating area), use a taxi or walk. The shuttle was always crowded as it is shared by many hotels and Novotel is one of the last in the pick up itinerary.
Overall, the hotel is very good. Still, more a 4 star than 5."
"Novotel Nusa Dua, has made our first experience in Bali an absolutely relaxing & fantastic time. The customer service is really good.
The room was wonderful, it looked over the golf course, thus we could not see the building work going on. 
In comparisons to other hotels; as we stayed at the Ayoyda hotel opposite for two nights & my mother in law was staying at the Laguna, is Novotel is by far superior in terms of price & also customer service. The only aspect lacking at the Novotel, is its not built on a private beach.
I will be staying at the Novotel again, if I stay in Nusa Dua. Saying that, I dont think I will be staying in Nusa Dua as its too far away from places of interest.
Thanks & Best Regards"
"My family and I stayed at Novotel Nusa Dua for the Labor day long weekend. My wife and I have stayed at the hotel a few times before but this was the first time we brought our 8 month old son. This was his first vacation ever!

The Room: I opted for the 1 bedroom suite and we were very happy. The room is much bigger than our apartment in Singapore! I also called in advance for a baby cot and this was given for free. The cot was a little old but it did serve it's purpose. 

The Food: Since I've been here a few times, I stuck to the local food. The Sop Buntut/Buntut Goreng (Beef Tail Soup/Fried Beef Tail) was fantastic! The other stuff was just so-so. They need to update their menu. 

The Service: The hotel staff was very polite. Sometimes it would take a while for the food or other stuff to arrive but still within a manageable time. But when my son got a fever on our last night, the staff was very attentive and the new hospital at Nusa Dua was only 5 minutes from the hotel. Good thing we didn't need to go. 

Final Word: Overall, the Novotel Nusa Dua offers great value for your money and especially people travelling with kids. If you're like me and don't like the hustle and bustle over at Kuta, Legian & Seminyak, just chill out at Nusa Dua."
"The layout of the Novotel Bali Nusa Dua is one of its main features with its manicured gardens and the several swimming pools as well. There is a free shuttle very 15 minutes to their patrolled beach. Then the shuttle to the Bali Collection shopping mall. The area is a complex of several hotels of which Novotel is one. The area is extremely safe for westerners and the taxi driver pointed out the patrolling security, the surveillance headquarters and some of the clever camera works. The dinner one night at the restaurant was supported by Balinese traditional dancing and music.  Breakfast was top class with great variety, and a good start to any day. Yes 8.4 is fine by us."
"I've stayed for only 1 day, I take deluxe kings room, but I notice to hotel that I'm on honeymoon. See the notification, novotel upgrade my room into private pool villa with two bedroom. for affordable price i enjoyed stay as exclusive guest. they decorate my villa with flower on bathtub and on a bed. Novotel also have great location in Nusa Dua Resort, they have private beach and wonderful pool. They also provide free shuttle to Bali collection (Modern market in Nusa Dua)."
"when we finally checked into our hotel at novotel nusa dua after much effort as our guide wasn't too familiar with the area, we were wow-ed. first, we got upgraded from a superior deluxe suite to a double room suite and the suite was suite was huge, much bigger than the one we had in batam and it was awesome! both our bedroom and the living room could access the balcony and the guest room had it's own private, although separated bath room with a sliding door for privacy. awesome! it could fit more than 10 people in there easily and we will definitely book novotel should we come down to bali again. best of all, the hotel has it's own private beach about 3 minutes away and there is a shuttle bus going there once every 20 minutes. that night, i fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow - a good night's rest alas!"
"This is first time in Bali and stayed in Novotel Hotel, Nusa Dua. Its a very nice and clean hotel. Large room and very comfortable bed. Most important thing is; it is very safe to stay especially in Nusa Dua area. They have security check before entered to Nusa Dua area and again security check before entered to Novotel hotel. Easy access to ATM or mini mart or shopping and just a few minutes walk."
We had yet another great time at the Novotel Nusa Dua. This time we booked a 2 bed apartment which was magic. The large bathrooms and living areas suited us very nicely as we have a very active 18month old little one. I loved the huge bath and separate shower in our large ensuite. The breakfast is to die for and we love spending time at the pool and having a drink at the pool bar as the sun goes down. We took our little one to the beach via the constantly running beach shuttle only 5 mins away and we also took a stroll to the beach bar one night for a drink. Our little one loves to play in the sand and is quite content as we were sipping back a drink. We hired a driver for the day to go sightseeing and had no trouble in getting to and from the hotel. The shuttle to Bali collection is also good as its easy to get around with a pram and the little restaurants are very nice and we had a lovely meal there. Its sim to the open air malls we have back in Oz. Overall the Novotel is a great family hotel and we would be happy to go back again and again.
"This was our first stay at Nusa Dua,and when we arrived at Novotel it was breathtaking..the scenery the atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful. From the first moment we stepped our foot at the hotel we received nothing but first class treatment. The staff was very friendly and checked us in in no time. 
Although our room didn't have a view but, it was right next door to the restaurant and swimming pool. We were happy with the size of the apartment, the kitchen has all the amenities we needed as we have a toddler and always has to wash and prepare food for her. 
we are most were happy when they have a multi power point in the room so we didnt need a converter. 
Breakfast buffet choices was good, they even has a little spot for kids. my daughter loves getting her own juices and fruit on the stick. she also love the kidspot and the caretaker there was so lovely. 
We wished we stayed longer at Novotel and will definetly return and tell our friends about it!"
"Novotel is located in nusa dua and has a  great facilities. Eventhough the hotel doesn't have direct access to the beah,novotel provides a shuttle car to the hotel's private beach which has a very nice, white sands. We basically booked 2 standards room, but when we arrived, the management upgraded our hotel room  to the bigger room that had a dining table and kitchen, complete with the litchen sets.  My youngest kid, 13 yrd old really loves the kids club. So he said many times, that he would love to stay again in this hotel. Comment from my kid -for me- is really a proof,that Novotel is a great hotel to stay with the family."
"Great experience during stay in Novotel since they really care about us (even we're native ppl, big various swimming pool, children heaven, nice beach, and friendly staff. We've got free upgrade from deluxe to suite room, which was very large room with its own kitchen, living room, dining room, big room and bathroom and nice balcony. We are treated very special by novotel staff. thanks Novotel. We will make sure to stay there again if we come to Nusa Dua Bali."
"the environment are great ! especially the area in nusa dua bali. all surrounded with 5 star hotel and the beach. place in quiet n full of forest ,and of course many shopping and restaurant near our hotel novotel. i'll recommend this hotel novotel again for my friends. the room definately great and gorgeous the toilet and balcony very tidy and creativity!"
"In a luxurious area dedicated for tourists, Novotel Nusa Dua Hotel is a hotel with high value for money, especially suitable for families with children, because there are daily activities arranged for kids and teenagers, also with greener environment. Parents can leave children in the kids club for a while, or have a spa for kids. Also with nightly room price for 1 child free till 16 years of age.
Very nice hotel indeed."
"This was a great hotel for our family stay, and we didn't feel out of place with a little one as there were lots of families. The pool is great and well spread out so we often had a little corner to ourselves. The room was awesome - large, spacious, nicely allocated, and had a beautiful bathroom which opened to the main. We also liked that Novotel wasn't too big - about 170 rooms compared to some of the bigger ones with over 500 rooms.
This was our first time in Nusa Dua and the only strange thing for us was that Nusa Dua feels like an exclusive gated community of wealthy hotels where you can't really walk to anything of interest. There weren't any close street stores, shops or restaurants - which we love about Bali. The hotel has everything so that you don't really have to leave - but we missed the streets, shops and locals of Legian-Seminyak-Cunggu."
"what i love about novotel is they have a large bathroom which resembles to the large of bedroom.. they have nice environment with a great facility. it's lovely place to stay, whether with your couple or your family. with many trees surrounded, novotel nusa dua become a cozy place to stay. though it's quite far from nusa dua beach, yet novotel provide shuttle bus for their guests. they also have a delight meal for breakfast, with many various of food and beverages, it's a worth to spend."
"This was my 3rd stay at The Novotel Nusa Dua and onnce again I was very impressed with my stay. I love being able to "" get away "" from the busy parts of Bali and The Novotel is perfect for that. The food at the pool bar and the Square resturant is always yummy and they have a great range of cocktails . The day spa had a great christmas special that I just couldnt pass up . I can not wait to come back and do it all agian ."
"We loved our stay at Novotel Nusa Dua although we havent stayed in a 5 star internationally before so a bit hard to tell if the fantastic experience we had is typical of all hotels in Bali.  The staff were delightful, although we now know that all Balinese are beautiful people.  They fell in love with our 18 month old and couldnt have been more sincere and welcoming.  We loved our room although we had a view of a building site - we didnt mind this since we got the room at such a great rate and really only were in our room at nights.  The bed was divine - the largest King size we have ever come across!"
"Novotel Hotel in Nusa Dua Bali is one of the best hotels you can ever get given a limited budget. The layout of the rooms are perfect and will give you the flexibility to work, reflect on the quietness of the place and have a luxurious bath. Room service is fast and very friendly. I really had a good stay in that hotel."
"We, me and my fiancee stayed at this hotel in order to attend an event at other hotel in this area but we dont to stay there because we need some privacy.
Novotel Nusa Dua Hotel is such a great hotel for couple. The room is quite big and I love the bathroom also.
All part of the hotel is beautiful, but spending time in the room only was also great because the room is beautiful and romantic:)"
"I must say that Novotel Nusa Dua really exceeded my expectation. The check-in was fast and upon entering the rooms, we were greeted with a spacious room with a really big bathroom with a wooden window overlooking the bedroom. The pool was excellent with the water at the right temperature. The breakfast selection was good with a kids corner where my children was happily having their food and coloring.

The staffs are all very friendly and always with a smile. The shuttle bus to the beach was very prompt. 

I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Will definitely come back again."
"The Novotel Nusa Dua hotel is in a very good location in Bali, we have to pass through two security check booth. They have shuttle bus to nearest Bali collection, I could make shopping and lunch or dinner in there as well as a beautiul beach,  it could be spent a day."
definitely we'll come back
Location is great. Food is decent. Acess to all eminitues nearby. Private beach. 👌👌👌
"Loved my stay here,
The Staff especially Loren and Awan are top notch - always a message away whenever i need anything.
Buffet breakfast that was included was great too.
Will definitely go back when i'm in Nusa Dua"
Facilities and care by the hotel staff is incredible. The hotel room and ambience makes you feel exotic.
"Nice hotel, huge pool, clean room and good food"
Need to locate (pin)exact loactionn in google map as we check in in wrong hotels (Mariot members hotels)
"We had super enjoy stay at Novotel Nusa Dua, Bali. This is our 1 night extended stay for total 3 nights. 
What we like: 
+ The room (its a new design with nice interior color, spacious, wood flooring), 
+ The staffs are nice and helpful (especially Bli Putra), 
+ The hotel facilities (bicycle rent, shuttle to the beach), 
+ The superb greenery surroundings, 
+ Spacious restaurants area with plenty choices of F&B also beautiful scenery of Gourmet Bar,
+ Many activities arranged by the Hotel. 
+ The Mengiat Beach is the best beach in Bali, it has white sands, it is private and it is clean. 
+ They support sustainability 👍
Surely we are going to stay again at this hotel when we visit Bali in our next trip.
All the best Novotel!"
"Located in Nusa Dua, in ITDC complex, with luxurious, green, beautiful vibes. I really like the place, the service, the pool. I just hope if they can have their private beach closer from my room. Overall, I think the price is totally worth the stay. I think family time would be great to be spent here. Thank you, Novotel."
All are best condition.
"The room is spacious and is sooo complete. I am so much helped since im travelling with family. It has kitchen full equipped with large refrigerator & freezer, plates, spoon, forks, etc etc."
"Good facilities, pool, staff"
"I’ve stayed for six night, overall four star from me. facilities, food, location, staff and ambience was great, but cleanliness need to be upgrades, especially on bed, linen, and sofa. Me and my daughter are very sensitive with dust and we can felt it so bad, and I saw how the house keeping was cleaned the room. they’re not detail enough l, without any vacuum, and more focus on how neat the room, not how clean the room.. i got linen and bedcover with spot and it was huge.. I’ll change to five star and will back to this hotel if the cleanliness already upgraded"
I would come again with my family
Oke
It was not first stay in this hotel and probably I will return. It is just a good value for the price considering room size and all other hotel services
"The hotel is still competitive compares to the new hotels around. From my first visit in 2010, my experience is still great for the services and ambience."
I would book this again! Everything was perfection. The pool is amazing. The beach is even better! And the room is furnished so elegantly. The staff are ALL super. I just loved this place.
"Not a 5 star experience, room was in need of modernisation and felt unloved. For the price we paid we expected more. 
Breakfast was okay but nothing special. Pool nice but felt small due to upper and lower pools not connected.
If going to Nusa Dua I would recommend spending a bit more and staying at one of the proper 5 star resorts. I paid for 7 nights but left after 5 due to the above."
"The rooms are dated but  spacious.
Excellent size of bathrooms."
"Hotel located inside the Nusa Dua hotels area. We went here with two other couples, 3 rooms. Rooms were old need to refurbish. No amenities whatsoever. Only soap, shampoo and handsoap. Dental kit, shower cap, slippers need to be requested, even the small towels. We got only basic two big towel for shower. 
Room a bit dark. Hospitality need to be improved. Beach access need to use shuttle mini car. Which is quite smaller area compared to some other hotels in the same area. Beach was nice. Part of Mengiat beach in Nusa Dua. One of the best in Bali. 
But prices is cheaper compared to other hotels in the same area. Breakfast was good. Overall Novotel Nusa Dua is good for budget travelers who want to stay in Nusa Dua area. But if you have more budget, perhaps look for other hotels."
Love it
"Great place, staff are nice"
Everything was awesome. Private beach and walkways. Swimming pool. Rooms. One small blip was plugs didnt work properly. Breakfast spread and taste was super. Will comeback for sure
"Spent one night at Novotel Nusa Dua with my family and the faucet at my rooms bath tub leaked. And there was a weird noise coming out from the toilet after I flushed it. So I have to wait for around 5 minutes until the sound disappeared. The room service also very slow, There was no toothbrushe provided by the hotel. The breakfast was below my expectations.
One of the lights flickered a few times.
And the bathtub was kinda dirty,
There was hair/leftover sponge particle in the bathub.
The things I love about Novotel Nusa Dua were its Private Beach that was so beautiful, and the hotel provided balcony and hangers so we can dry our wet clothes after swimming. The room also very spacious."
Good service and rooms
"Cool, recommended"
"This place is perfect. Love the access to the private beach. The breakfast was amazing. The room is very comfortable. The staff are great. Great place, great service, awesome location! Love to come back for another stay"
"The staff were not welcoming. Many especially one male receptionist was very rude and arrogant. The friendliest staff were the security and gardeners. During breakfast staff just watched you serve yourself. They don’t make conversation or try to help and assist you. Staff were not knowledgeable about their food menu and couldn’t tell you information about ingredients in certain dish. The staff just seem as though they hate working there. Perhaps they are also unhappy with the hotel management.
I wished we stayed in a smaller villa/hotel with more friendly staff. It was not worth staying in a bigger place/apartment style room. I would have rather stayed in a smaller place with friendly people around me."
"First time stay at 4 stars hotel without sliper at room,without coffee and without amenities,( i have called them to provide those) they are not provide until check out,worst experience at 4 stars hotel"
I booked a suite which had 2 rooms. Space is big and homely. Nice Swimming Pool. Pool view Ruby 8303. Peaceful garden with pool. Hotel photographers to snap pics of u and provide you 1 pic with frame. Restaurants with good food alongside the road. Tropical Restaurant is the best. The rest are over rated and taste blend. Other than that not much amenities. Massage spa along the road. Cheap and good. Restaurants provide chauffeur services thru and fro if you book a table at the place.
no comment
"Close to the beach, close to the restaurant, close to the shopping center. Clean and friendly. Perfect!👍"
"Good location, very friendly and helpful staff. The room was comfortable, and clean. The bed was very comfortable also👍"
"great location, great facilities, big pool, big restaurant with rather a lot breakfast selection. Very big bed, eventho the room itself needs a lot of touch up. Deluxe room with balcony with pool view is great. big size of room. you need to ask for slipper if you need it. They have their own beach club, you can go with shuttle that available every 15mins. the ride is about 4 minutes, or 10 minutes easy walk to the beach club. You can get the towel there, no need to bring it from hotel."
"If you come with a scooter, you can temporarily park in the front. Then you need to get lost and ride it to the other side of the hotel. No one initially explained that, then got a call from reception to move the scooter per management request where I placed it. 
When checking out, the scooter was needed to attach the box with luggage again. They didn’t want to let me through the gate to do so and urged me to turn around. (Which I respectfully declined.)
Imagine riding up to the hotel where you spent your money on food, drinks, etc. and being denied access and urged to turn around for a 30 second stop and go. I don’t blame the hotel’s staff as they are possibly afraid to lose their job over not adhering to their management overlords. BIG NO to stay here again."
Poor Service. Far from City
Novotel Nusa Dua always been a favourite hotel for us even for family.Staffs are very friendly..Definitely will stay there again.

"Good: staff was helpful 
Reception staff was friendly 
Bell boy help us alot by driving us to n fro villa as we have 2 kids
Willing to compensate us (2 free adults bbq seafood grill buffet)
Bad: no hot water first day, after fix it was ok for 1 day then third day no hot again.
Aircon not working at master bedroom and second bedroom. Fix n was ok for a few hours then not cold again.
We stayed at villa 9116. Was abit outdated on the room decor. Not very newly furnished. Light is quite dim at night. The whole villa has no cool lights only warm light. Not so okay for us as we have 2 small kids. Not much plug available. 
Still want to thanks the bell boy they help us the most.
Overall: 5.5/10"
"2 bedroom apartment was large and comfortable, we did have to pay extra to ""rent"" a microwave in a full kitchen"
"When I looked at the pics on the interent, the room looked a lot nicer. When I saw is worn out floors, and walls that were not clean. I had to switch rooms because the first one smelled like mold. It was also dark. The service is good. Nice that they have buggy rides up and down the location. Another good point is the room is very spacious, and variety for breakfast food was good. 
The balcony was a nice choice, and it came wirh a laundry hanger."
"Good facilities but hotel is in need of a refurb, especially the rooms. Breakfast not 5* poor choice for Western taste. Mould on bread.
Beach club very poor compared to other premium chains"
"it seems they managed to trick me by displaying photos of properties that look nice and luxurious.  As a matter of fact, this hotel is an old hotel and not maintained at all. Their beach is not in the same location as the hotel but has to take a bus for about five minutes, really disappointing."
