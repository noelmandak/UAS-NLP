We loved staying at this resort! The rooms were comfortable and the pools were clean and nice to use. The staff is very friendly. The breakfast has great free options but also had hot meals you could purchase. The wifi wasn’t great in the rooms but worked well in the lobby area. Lots of shops and fantastic restaurants nearby and close to the beach. Would stay again!
"The hospitality is very good and the location is also perfect. The food is good. 
They provided us with many free vouchers for dinner , Massage. Also we were lucky to get the luck santa gift for Christmas with a floating breakfast in our villa and also massage. Lastly during our checkout we received another coucher for free 1 night stay on our next booking. We loved it. Only the con was mosquito . I think its a problem all over bali and you can get rid of them by applying mosquito repellent. Overall it's was an excellent stay 👍"
"My second stay here and I love it. The bungalow rooms are huge and well equipped. I love the outdoor bathroom and they are located close to the pool. Perfect location set back from the main road, delicious breakfast and the friendliness staff"
"I booked a stay with Tony’s for my sister’s birthday. The pictures don’t do it justice and it looks better in person. The staff were friendly & welcoming. You’ll always be greeted with a smile & feel at home away from home. The ambiance was amazing. The location was very central to Seminyak, with most dinning, spas/massages, bars & restaurants within walking distance. We enjoyed our stay. I would give it a 10/10. It was worth very dollar. Don’t wait, book it now, you won’t regret it!!!! Thank you Tony’s!"
"Everything at this resort was fantastic. I stayed in the bungalow and it is a huge villa, comfortable bed and I loved the outdoor bathroom. The staff do everything they can to help you, the location is great and even though there are 2 nightclubs close by, it is still quiet at night. Highly reccommend"
Food is great at the restaurant! Lots to choose from for the breakfast menu. Staff are very kind and helpful. Spacious bedrooms.
I had to get out of my previous booking AyurvedaGram Bali because of their horrible service and facilities. I'm glad Tony had a room available for me to spend my last night in Bali and it was amazing. The location is beautiful the facilities are nice the staff is friendly the service is good.
"Staff and management were excellent. Facilities are great.
Safe, quiet and tranquil. Nothing is a problem to the staff.
If you want to feel like you are in paradise this is the place to come.
Walking distance to restaurants and shops. Service like local drivers, taxis, Go jek are all within a phone cal. Certainly will be back"
"From the moment I arrived I knew I would enjoy it here. I stayed in a Bungalow which is very spacious and modern. They are located right next to a pool in a lovely garden area. Breakfast is full of options, the staff are amazing and the location is perfect"
"We had a beautiful room with our outdoor area leading directly to the pool, was great! Breakfast and staff were also very nice and the location is perfect"
"If you’re a seasoned traveler, you can download the app grab by a chip at the airport and use the app to get to anywhere you wanna go in Bali."
"The location was great, just 5 mins walking to the beach, Potato Head beach club just infront of this hotel.. what I like most is the place is quite and clean.. Thanks for all the staff, will come again for sure"
Was really nice for what we paid. Great location too! Right my potato head. I just wouldn’t recommend getting any food or drink there.
"It's one of the best Villas. Great location, very comfy and clean room, best value, and exceptional staff service. Would like to express.my gratitude to Ms. Rani and team as well for her exceptional service and hospitality"
We had a great 1 night stay at Tony’s villa & resort. They kindly upgraded us with a Pinky Villa which was absolutely PERFECT to start our Bali trip.  Such a peaceful and relaxing place in busy Seminyak area. Thank you to all the staff for their kindness!
"Large room 38m square, clean and A good Breakfast, the location close to canggu, many restaurant, shop and near the beach.."
"Me and my wife had an amazing time at the hotel. We spent 2 nights in one of the villas which was private, clean, and spacious. After that we moved to a delixe room for an extra 2 nights which was also amazing. What made the experience so fantastic was the staff. They were very helpful and kind. They were very attentive to any needs and very patient. The location is great, close to everything. The pools were also fantastic great sunshine. Would definately come back!"
"Such an amazing resort in a great location! We booked a 1bdr villa and absolutely loved it, the space was big but cosy and the bathroom was stunning with the large bath and outdoor shower. It was so nice in the mornings to wake up to the warmth and jump straight into your own cool pool. The service was so lovely and assisted whenever needed. The location was great too, close to some great cafes and sports bar and within walking distance to Seminyak Village"
We lived our stay here. The villa was great and the staff are excellent and very helpful. Great Bathroom and Pool. Comfortable Bed. Highly recommended.
What can I say a truly money for value place. Mary the manager is wonderful and helpful.
"Very very pleasantly surprised!! Amazing place, hosts & staff!"
"They offer one-ways transport from/to airport which is super handy, we chosen to pick up from airport. The villa is very tropical with 2 big main swimming pool, they offered a lot of activity during our staying. The breakfast  comes with a lots of choice. Only the spa is a bit tricky, they offer 10 mins welcome massage but seems they are also busy booking."
"What I love the most about Tonys is the large room and the nice balcony with the sound of water fountains. It's not pricey, and you can ask for additional pillows or towels with no additional charge. The staffs are really helpful and kind.
The location is really near to Woobar and Potatoe Head!! and you can walk only like 7-10 mins to reach Petitenget beach."
The best service I've ever had
"Pros: Good Location. Walking distance to shishi night club, you will be able to walk back to your room as long as you are not dead drunk. 
Friendly and helpful staff.
Breakfast is average
Wifi is not very stable (for work meeting. average usage is still ok)
Clean
Safe (there is guard house)
Cons: Not close to the beach, but it's easy to get gojek in bali, so not an issue for me. 
Dont get the bungalow or villa, those are kinda old. Hotel room connected to pool is great"
"Value for money in the heart center of Seminyak area. Shopping, bars, food center just walk by from the villa. The main gate green tunnel was so cool!  We love it, will come back"
"Amazing staff at Tony’s, close to everything for Seminyak - Beach, Beach Clubs, Decent Bars / Restaurants. I have to applause the staff, so polite , kind and helpful - They can not do enough for you. I would 100% reccomend staying here and I will be back."
"I stayed at the bungalows, feels like ure in a jungle, but yet u’re in the middle of the city with all the restaurants and clubs around you. Great breakfast and cute swimming pools. Helpful staff who actually spend some time to make small talk with you. Id defo recommend"
great place to work from Bali and doing your business trip in here
"Nice room, but the bathroom is a bit old. Staff are friendly."
"Very nice hotel and villas many swimming pools. It's a great stay comfortable beds, spacious room friendly staff.  Good location the rooms away of the busy street"
"Got the Bungalow and the place was clean. Really loved the spacious wash room only gripe was there was no bum sprayer 😅 and the limited hot water. Mt kids usually showered first and when it was my turn the water wasn't that hot.
Other than that, the pool was nice although the pool bar was closed."
The staff is very nice and its a prime location of Semniyak. All the clubs like Potato head motel mexicola etc are at walking distance
happy to stay here. while doing a business trip
Luxury at the same time
"Super friendly and helpful staff! The resort is located right in the middle of happening bars and places, made it convenient to reach anywhere"
Very clean beautiful villa
"The Hotel is Nice.  It is right in the heart of Seminyak so it is easily accessable, and near to beach. The staff was giving a great service and communication. For the room, It seems like a quite new building. I was staying in room 1211. the AC needing a maintenance because it wasn’t too cold even I already set it to 18 with full fan. Amenities was nice, complete, and clean. One weird thing for me is shampoo and body soap is become one product (possibly the same liquid as the hand soap too). Eventhough it is good product and I am fine with it, still it feel weird for me.  Over all I am pretty pleased in staying at this Hotel."
"Strategic place, near to everywhere."
"Love the room, pool and bed. Staff is  perfect and breakfast was so awesome :)"
"I had a great time staying in this place. I love the private pool. The room is spacious. However, there are things to improve. First, I had to boil the water close to the sink because the electricity plug is not in the table. The lock was not working. So need some checking for better maintenance."
Easy check in
Enjoy for long stay in here
"within walking distance to popular clubs, cafes, restaurants, beaches. there are some convenience stores nearby. best location!"
All service terbaikk
"The staff were absolutely wonderful, special praise for Suar and Diky. The facilities and room were great, plus the staff were quick to respond to any issues. The pool was wonderful and breakfast was great. The only major issue I had was that I got no sleep. The walls and door are thin and I could hear everything from neighbours and in the hallway. Also, there’s a rooftop club close by that plays booming music until 3/4am so basically I didn’t sleep at all. If you’re not going to be out late drinking or clubbing, I don’t recommend this place, otherwise it was great."
"Villa is a little old but clean, service staff is excellent and pays attention to details. Very impress with their customer service. Location is near the attractions and easy to get around. Thank you!"
"Good location, staff very cooperative and breakfast menu should have been better or they can ask guest early if they can..but good place to stay"
"The location is excellent, walking distance to most of the hits places. 
 Room are ok with the price."
"Tonys villas is a lovely hotel the staff are lovely location is great the only things that lets down this hotel is their breakfast menu  there is not a great deal to choose from and sometimes it was cold ,also the noise from night clubs across the road was loud you couldn't get to sleep which was a bit of a pain I had to buy ear plugs to wear of a night but apart from  those couple of complaints the hotel was nice."
"Good place, facility, and service.."
It is a good location. The staff is nice. But I would not recommend. The breakfast is so so. The pool and the balcony is not clean.
"Over all, The Bungalow was pretty comfy. I was staying in room 2019. the building is quite old and a bit dirty especially for the bathroom area because it is slippery at the begining.. they need to scrub the floor. The AC was terrible and need changes. it was turned of in every 30 minutes. We complained but thank god the staff was pretty responsive and gives an effort to fix it even it isn’t fixable. So for 1st night they moved us to one of the hotel room because no other bungalow replacement available. But in the morning they moved us to bungalow 2007 and it is better than the previous one. The staff gives us a compensation for the inconvinience by driving us to airport. The food was good, I enjoy it."
We stayed in the villas which were spacious with a large bathroom and shaded balcony. The pool in the section was lovely. Good value for money.
"In seminyak area. Very walkable. The villa is huge,50m2 with outdoor showers and tub 🛀. But the villa is old, looks like it, smells like it. Many stayed for long time,like 1 month coz of the location. This villa had its glory time but must be renewed"
"We stayed for 3 days 2 nights before went to ubud. Good hotel but if i compare to another hotel , its a just good hotel not best hotel. Thanks for having us"
nice location in seminyak
"we had a fine stay, got upgraded on the spot. but sadly due to the pandemic, it wasnt as clean as it supposed to be. but the food was great, the staffs were helpful and the location was incredible"
We headed to Bali for a break & wasn’t Sure on what to expect we landed at Tony’s Villars and they could not help us enough with locations and how to get around seven yak staff a brilliant and the facilities are the second best and I would highly recommend Tony Villa’s.
"My partner and I stayed in the pool access room. The room was clean but the pool and balcony area could do with a clean.
There was a good variety of breakfast to choose from both western and indo.  Lovely fruit, juices and breads buffet. 
Staff were amazing and accommodating. 
Overall we were satisfied with our stay!"
"Pretty typical budget hotel in a good location if you need to be close to beaches and Seminyak dining / nightlife.  Pool is nice, and so is the free breakfast.
My only complaint would be paper-thin walls. You will hear everything if your neighbors start talking moderately loudly.  I recommend bringing earplugs."
"Once everything was fixed...lock from room to pool, safe replaced, air conditioner leaked and TV replaced. It was great. Tiles are super slippery coming in wet from the pool but they provided another floor mat"
"Simple bungalow with spacious bathroom, amazingly lush and quiet gardens just off the busy street. Would happily stay again."
"We stayed for 3 nights in the one bedroom pool villa. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We were told about some renovation works outside our villa which may cause some inconveniences and disruptions, hence we were provided some vouchers as recovery service. However, the villa was slightly run down overall and not well-maintained. Cleanliness can be improved and the pool inside the villa was pretty dirty hence we did not really make use of it. Although we were offered 15-mins free massage, we were not able to claim it as the spa was always fully booked. Do take note of plenty mosquitoes as well. It was an acceptable stay given the location, staff friendliness and overall considered comfortable. Hopefully the cleanliness will be improved."
Great experience! Would recommend
"Location is great because it’s near the restaurants and beach clubs in Seminyak area. But hotel itself is just so so. Needs improvement, the door in my bathroom is kinda broken and about to be torn. Bathroom is not clean and to my surprise toiletries here is not complete as other hotel provides. Breakfast is just semi buffet style. It’s ok but I guess when I visit Bali, I won’t book here again"
"very good location, infront of the main road, accross the desa potatohead."
"The only best thing about the property is the pool and area which is located rest room size is very small, the staff is not supportive as they barely understand English. 
Decent stay if you find it below 3000/-"
"Overall is ok but water supply is too weak, first night without hot water until we make complaint."
"The standard rooms are not as nice in person. If you can get the bungalows which are so much better. The facilities are just ok. The staff was amazing but the best thing is it was a walking distance from mrs sippy, potato head and mexicola."
Place is a tad tired like most since the pandemic. Pools could doo with a good schoosh!  Only part of Brekky that the buffet is eg fruit/toast with then only one option selected on menu. Staff aimed to please & we’re all lovely!
"We were greeted with a lovely rose petal display entering our room. Room itself was very spacious, with a huge bathroom. 
Villa  is in need of a refresh. Linens and towels were very tired and worn (with holes)."
It was fine to stay. it was not so clean and in real it looks old. Not nice as photo. And got so much tired because from the lobby to the room it was so far. I did not like much but it was ok.
I think the bungalow need plenty of maintenance and upgrading works on their showers sprinklers and toilet sanitization as water cannot be flush down. The curtains should be change as it’s been too old and sunlight peers through the cloth. Plenty of upgrading works needs to be done as it’s old property.
"So I booked a bungalow room at first and it turns out to be a total disaster.
It's far and dark, a lot of insects, mosquitoes.
Aircond not working
Water heater not working 
The hotel is nice enough to send a few person to repair it but failed.
The struggle last until 2am and finally they put me into a huge villa with dirty pool then promise to move me to a hotel room the next day.
no compensation or anything but at least the hotel room for my upcoming stay are perfect.
so, dont get the bungalow or villa, those are kinda old and rundown. Hotel room connected to pool is great."
"Pros include the location and relatively good value for money. There are quite a few eateries and shops next it so a big thumbs up for the convenience. The cons though not too many, bothered me alot and also to those who absolutely detest mosquitoes. The villas while spacious have the wooden doors for the main entrance and separating the bedroom and outdoor shower areas. These doors have gaps all round large enough to let houseflies through, let alone mosquitoes! I finally understood why a single electronic mosquito repellant needed a box of pellet refills. With the gaps, the aircon would of course be insufficient to cool the room make the situation better. Avoid the villas especially 2003 if you wish to rest well after a day of sun n surf.  There are better rooms out there for the same money."

"Given a twin size when requested double
Was told it would be sorted (it wasn’t)
Air con wasn’t great 
Tv didn’t work great 
Balcony view was a wall
Breakfast was ok
Staff were polite
Wouldn’t recommend or go again"
"This hotel is tired, run down and in need of a revamp.
The nightclub across the road is REALLY LOUD. If you plan on sleeping at this hotel for the night, prepare for the worst and hope for the best.
The only upside is that this hotel is in a pretty central location to all of the bars and restaurants that are popular in seminyak"
"Stayed here pre-pandemic in the 1-bedroom villa and it’s always quite a lovely hotel. It could be the pandemic has them cutting corners to save money but this stay was truly awful. My bathroom had no hot water, I couldn’t shower before a dinner after sweating all day. Couldn’t even have cold shower as 3 men we’re in there trying to fix it for hours. They left muddy footprints thru the bathroom, hallway & room too. Hot water is the basics for a hotel room.  
Then they told me they could move me after dinner but didn’t have any pool rooms left so I’d be downgraded with no mention of reimbursement. 
The Seminyak location is now the new Kuta to start.  There was a roof too bar next door that has loud music until 1am that was very loud in the room even with ear plugs. There was a note under the door to invite us, saying we could have a free drink and the party would go until 1am. Very Kuta. Not good if you want a good nights sleep. 
Next morning I asked for glass of water with my breakfast & it came warm. Didn’t drink it & no one understood  when I asked for cold water to drink. 
Later they gave me a meal voucher for dinner to apologize for the no hot water & loud music, which was lovely. But I had a stir fry chicken dish & had severe diarrhea all night afterwards. Felt concerned about the fresh produce & preparation quality. 
Hope the iron out the issues but atm they’re not a good hotel to stay, I’d avoid & check the reviews later to see if they improve."
"Oh no no. The shower doesn’t work. The temp of the water is impossible to adjust. The basin sink doesn’t drain the water. The floor is sticky and has puddles of water (??) Also, the club music can be heard from my room"
"Waste of money,,
Not clean at all"
"I spent 4 nights at Tony's Villas & Resort in June and it felt like an old friend. The staff were amazing - friendly and so diligent in remembering my name. I was on my own this visit and will definitely be bringing the family back to Tony's. Location is a gem. My villa was hidden in an oasis of gardens behind the hussle of the main street in Petitenget and an easy walk to Seminyak, Kudeta, Potato Head and Batu Belig. If you need a driver, Wayan (Tony's brother in law) is on hand. Thank you Tony for a sublime r&r at your resort and villas. Look forward to introducing you to my family next visit."
"The very first impression on the villa when we reached there is, it'll be a great stay. the place is clean and welcomed by nice services.

we were served with refreshing welcome drink while waiting to be check-in and the processing is very fast.

when we stepped into our private villa, everything is exactly as the photos we saw on the website. the villa is just so lovely and big enough for me and my lovely wife to indulge ourselves and feel comfortable with the stay.

in the villa, there's a setup of dining table beside the private pool with Bali style and great for relaxing. the bed is comfortable and clean. lastly, the outdoor bathroom with shower and bathtub to relax in. there's necessary appliances such as mosquito repelling adapter, safe box, hair dryer and water heater. and there is an umbrella too. the villa is very thoughtful on our needs.

during dinner time, we requested to serve the dinner in our villa and enjoy it by the pool. the only letdown was the rain. it rained the whole evening and the shelter for our dining table was leaking. although it's very nice to dine outdoor by the pool, but the leaking kinda spoilsport. however, my wife loved the place very much.

we had our breakfast at the restaurant just beside of the fish pond and balinese setting. and the free wifi connectivity is only available at the lobby and restaurant. that's a bit let down.

the verdict, it's a very nice place for honeymoon and highly recommended for couple who intend to break free from busy town and enjoy simple and quiet stay. the food in the menu is nicely priced with lots of varieties.

but for those who wish to party, there's a Mint pub just across the street and rows of shops and restaurants were outside. and there's a Potato Head which is quite happening and nice place too.

to stay in the Tony's villa again? absolutely!"
"What a place! 3 pools, a lovely relaxing restaurant, bungalows, as well as standard hotel rooms and Indonesian-owned so your money stays local. Tonys seems to have it all and the location is pretty damned good! Hidden down a long driveway behind the hustle and bustle of Jl Pettitenget near Potato Head, this place is on the outskirts of the Seminyak vibe but you would think you were a million miles away. I stayed in a bungalow and it was just lovely. Plenty of parking for your scooter or walk down the driveway and grab a cab, easy peasy! The Duty Manager greeted me at breakfast and (after being invited) sat for a chat until my meal arrived -then remembered my name for the duration of my stay. I had a pool almost to myself in the afternoons and enjoyed Happy Hour drinks at the swim up bar. I'd definitely stay again at Tonys."
"i really love staying at tony's villa! the room is very spacious and i love the lush tropical garden arround the hotel. breakfast was delicious, they have real bacon! staffs are very nice and helpful, the swimming pool is beautiful. tony's villa is very close to good restaurants and famous bars, hu'u, potato head, ku de ta,  w resort and spa, etc and it's only takes 10 minutes walk to the beach! the only tiny little problem with this hotel is you could hear the noise from restaurants and bars, but there's nothing tony's villa can do about it. it didn't bother us that much. so we had a great and lovely stay at tony's villa!"
"I stayed at Tony Villas for 4 nights at One Bedrooms suite, when i arrived I decided to upgrade the last night to 1 bed room villa. The villa is extreme recommended with the acceptable price and i found it is the cheapest among if compared with others villas at Seminyak Area. Walking distance  to Potato Head, just 5 min away. Easy to get cab, very convenience location."
"An amazing villa complex. Awesome location close to the action 
Not necessarily a biggie but because of the lush surroundings, huge amount of  greenery etc - has small potential to draw few more mosquitoes than typically however this is so well managed by staff  and it's well worth overlooking one odd mosque for ALL its other pluses.  
 Tony himself is a lovely man too.  Nothing is too much of a problem for the gorgeous staff either.    They're ALWAYS smiling.  Such beautiful people - 
Stay.  
Also do visit  their Frangipani spa too for some reflexology.   Bliss out...  
You will not regret the decision to stay here.  We didn't;  now we just won't stay anywhere BUT Tony's in future! 
 Loved it...."
"Tony's Villa is a fresh breath of serenity, hidden down a long driveway off the busy streets of Seminyak. We were looking for a traditional Bali holiday and that is exactly what we got. The choice of the four breakfasts were nice and the meals at the restaurant were lovely. The pool is clean and the pool bar is fully stocked. We were so happy with our choice of accommodation and we would definitely stay there again."
"It was a ok villa with 2 sides... 1 with private pool in every villa and 1 w/o. We stayed in the cheaper one w/o a private pool but there is a community pool.

On arrival... we were greeted by more than just the friendliness of the staffs. There were a lot of mozzies in the room as it comes with a open bathroom at the back of the villa. Like usual Balinese style, the room had a open toilet, a bathtub, an enclosed shower and an open one where you see centipedes crawling under your feet.

Breakfasts are complimentary and so I am not complaining much although its neither too bad nor good.

The villa only provide a one way transfer (FOC). They will allow you to use their driver on the way back to the airport (if he is available) for 80,000Rupiahs. If not... they call a cab for you @ 100,000Rupiahs. Ohhhh... there are no shuttles to any part of Bali... you are on your own.

We chose this villa because its cheap and walking distance to the beach, Seminyak Square, and plenty of shopping and eateries.

You can visit Mint (apparently one of the more ""happening"" disco there just outside the hotel. Also 1 minute to W... where seriously I find it much better than Potato Heads (about 5 minutes walk).

Overall... cheap, good location, 7/10"
"Our second time at Tony's we stayed this time in the new resort, modern rooms around a roman type pool, a small Ceasars Palace. We loved the bungalows, rustic and green, in our first stay and will probably choose them the next time we come. They are currently being upgraded. We did get to meet the actual Tony this trip, he obviously sets a high standard, his staff ar remarkable even by Balinese standards."
"It was a very peaceful place to stay. Tonys villa is perfectly located... Close fro everything you wanna see on the island. The service is fabulous and very romantic! 
Only negative point was the noisy spa construction just behind out bungalow."
"Pros - location is excellent , in the heart of Seminyak walking distance to shops and beach  . Room was clean , comfortable bed , pool clean and private  no kids whilst I was there in July 18 . Breakfast was delicious and hotel staff very helpful .  My Daughter and I stayed in the villa near the pool and felt safe and relaxed . Highly recommend it .
Cons - none"
"my daughter and I stayed in a villa. Tonys' is in a great location and the staff  were all so sweet.....always smiling and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them.
one regret was that I didn't get up early enough to put towels on the loungers around the pool! someone beat us to that every day......maybe a few more would be good."
"tony's villa is in a great location in seminyak, close to many restaurants and shops, and still within walking distance (~10mins) to jl. oberoi (one of the main streets of seminyak).

the villas themselves are older however have been kept in great condition.  if you are after an affordable, comfortable and clean accommodation option then this is really perfect.

breakfast was included every day, with many options on what you'd like to eat, all freshly made, not just buffet style.

airport transfers were also included for free, which was not part of the deal with agoda, much to our surprise."
"An excellent 12 night stay at Tony’s the staff were all so helpful and friendly .
They accommodated our Vegan diet needs and could not do enough..
We had a pool access room which was a great choice, the resort has three pools , two restaurants and a spa. 
From the moment we were picked up at the airport we felt at Home , we have been to Seminyak on four occasions in the last three years and although all different properties  were all good we will be returning to Tony’s next year ."
"Tony’s Villa is centrally located in Seminyak with a lot of restaurants and cafes around. However, the villa is quiet and cozy without the noise from cars and pedestrians nearby. Staff are friendly and helpful while breakfast which served in a la carte including continental, Asian, Balinese, Indonesian, etc.  is great as well."
"My Wife and I stayed at the Bungalow. The place was exactly as it was described. . Location was excellent and the Staff was very helpful and engaging. Merry the  Duty manager was very engaging and very helpful. She helped me recover my Mobile Phone from Grab after I left it in the car, so relieved and very thankful for the driver for being honest and Merry for being helpful to retrieve from them. We also met Mr Tony himself as he personally engages himself with the staff and Customers....
Its a nice touch and you feel very welcome....
Congratulations and well done.. Highly recommended and will certainly stay again."
"Tonys villa was enjoyable, highly relaxing and considering it was near a busy road it was extremely quiet. The gardens were excellent and the atmosphere was lovely."
"i really enjoyed my stay at tony's villa.
the room was clean and confortable and the bathroom was quite spacious with outside shower.
staff are all kind and friendly, they serve good breakfast.
i will come back to stay here again at my next bali holiday.

as many others mentioned, beaware of mosquitoes.
only  pity thing is that there was no wifi available in a room.
(available in a lounge area though)"
"We had a bungalow which was really lovely in  traditional Balinese style with an outdoor shower. As you will see from the reviews there are a lot of comments on the mossies but we just sprayed our room before we went out for dinner and had our net down and we were not once bothered by them. The staff were all very lovely and helpful. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. These villas are in the midst of all the restaurants and shopping so great to be able to walk everywhere. our favourites were Bambu, La Lucciola and Barbacoa with best cocktails at Metrih putri (food was great too but on the expensive side), Spring for the Oxygen facial, pedicure and manicure and Bodyworks for massages"
"Loved staying at Tonys Villas and would recommend to friends. We originaly booked 1 night through Agoda- and stayed 3 nights and they held up the great rate the whole time even tho it ended up being a weekend. So close to Potato Head which is great place to chill day or night. A decent walking distance from the main drag of shops and restaurants(10-12 min) but we didn't mind because Tony's got us moto's for $5/day and its the way to go so you can explore everything. Breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. There are plenty of inexpensive places to eat that are delicious! Loved our room and all the deluxe rooms face out to the pool but its so jungle like you have super privacy from all sides!"
"This was a wonderful stay for my partner and I we stayed at Tonys for 4 nights.
perfect location ( close to potatoe Head which we also love )
The customer service from the staff is exceptional. lovely staff! 
everything from when we arrived to when we left was a great experience.
the rooms were very clean, beautiful bathroom and outdoor shower and spa bath !
The taxi and tour service also very helpful!
Thankyou for the great holiday we will be back!"
"We stayed in standard hut before moving into pool villa. Our hut was next to the big pool which was nice for night beer and chatting over the porch. They have welcome drink, fruit basket and water. The room had two showers and one hottub, but the hot water wasn't enough to fill the tub. Food menu in the hotel was expensive and we had salad which was not satisfying! But the breakfast menu was amazing, except the pancake was too soft and danish and croissant pastry werent very good, but other than that was great! You can walk to the street and have dinner in some nice restaurant there, but if you want cheap authentic local food then have to walk a long way, but eating local food as locals is the point of traveling at least I think, so its kinda a minus for staying in seminyak since restaurants there are all very western! And they don't really have many bars and night clubs nearby have to take a taxi!"
"The aircon was not working properly, I called the reception 4 times but they did not give a solution. I woke up 3 times due to the heat of the room. During the day another receptionist asked how was my aircon I said still the same and they offered me an electric fan which is already late because I had to check out that morning."
It was a nice stay in Tonys with all the helpful and friendly staffs. There are many restaurants and other facilities nearby.
"More a three star resort than the 4 stars it carries but it offers all one requires to enjoy a good Bali holiday  -  location, pleasant breakfast fare, the standard friendly Balinese staff and a no fuss approach to requests."
"the experience was better then i imagined. the staff were very welcoming and professional, breakfast was great and rooms were comfortable. loved the pools and ambience. location is great, except for the sounds of nightlife at night (it isnt too bad)"
"Not cold water for my room and took a lot of time to give me the solution.  Bad experience cause It was 2am and I was nothing, that I could take a shower."
We enjoyed our stay here... but breakfast could have been better...
Where to begin. Communication leading up to our arrival was excellent. Airport transfer organised was very easy and no stress. Staff on arrival super friendly. Massage was amazing. (Went twice). Room was clean and had everything we needed. Room service excellent. Breakfast excellent and is cooked to order. Location v convienient. All in all I have nothing but great things to say. Will absolutely return (soon). Thank you to everyone at Tony’s for making our stay so amazing
Absolutely wonderful place to stay. Beautiful little villa and amazing and caring staff who are very responsive. Had a bit of trouble finding a correct phone number and bathroom seemed like it could use a little more cleaning but would certainly stay here again. Wish we had been here longer! Pools were both beautiful and well maintained. Great location and great breakfast! Would certainly recommend!!
We stayed in a pool access. Was a lovely room and the other pools were also lovely. Staff were friendly and helpful. The massage was the best I’ve ever had. Location was perfect not far from the beach clubs and restaurants
"Good location, friendly and helpful staff, walking distance to beach clubs and supermarkets, good bfast, overrall beautiful property smack in the middle of Seminyak."
"Times have been tough through covid for business, especially Bali who rely on tourists.   Having said that, some upgrades could be done but doesn't affect the ambience, feel and the quality staff.  I opted to upgrade on Arrival to a room with a private plunge pool, garden and the most amazing bathroom with stone bath.  A private retreat to sit and have nibbles, drink and soak up the sun wearing whatever feels comfortable (nothing)  You won't be disappointed."
"The staff were amazing, gardens are amazing, only little thing was the shower wasn’t as hot as I would have liked, there was a few little things but staff fixed quickly  we stayed in a bungalow , staff were very quick to help with anything, we loved the kittys there ☺️☺️☺️"
"We enjoy the hotel spa, worth trying. Friend staff, arrange breakfast Box for us knowing we need to be out hotel early morning for Tour . Thank u"
"Hotel is at Perfect location.  Nearby many eatery. 
But when first night we stay villa, lots of mosquito And air Cond not Cold."
Just like everything 😄
The staff were really nice and friendly! Kudos to their attentiveness to give me a surprise on my birthday! Didnt expect it!
