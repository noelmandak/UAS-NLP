"Easy access to airport,  food and night life. A walking distance to the mall. Souvenirs shop Krishna also nearby by grab."
"Just 1minute walk to the Kuta Beach
Samping nya ada makanan halal seafood BATAM88
pemileknya Edie yang baik."
Great stay. Staff were attentive. The view from the rooftop pool was fantastic. Breakfast was fantastic! Will stay again!
"I got a good price on a promo panorama at top is great.
Cons - no breakfast even I paid $50 ? Whatever happened to the days in Bali where every guest got complimentary breakfast? Seems Covid-19 was an excuse to stop that .Now they decide to charge guests for breakfast it seems nearly everywhere.whatever happened to hospitality & goodwill towards ur guests ( sigh )"
"Awesome location. Great staff. Sad about the dirty beach ( plastic,food wrappers,& lots of other waste.) Government needs to divert some of the tourism $$ towards cleaning the beach front. Back to the hotel 5 out 5"
"The location is great, in front of Kuta beach, facilities is good... It has a roof top bar, Seven bar.  Nice swimming pool.."
Nice view and Great people
Best place to stay
"Small hotel, no open air balcony or terrace, but only few steps we'll reach the beach, convince store and (I think still halal) meatballs resto. Chiller works well, bed ok, clean (those compare to next next old hotel  Well maintained"
Location just one minute to Kuta Beach
"In October the hotel atmosphere is very quiet and the staff are few, lack of security and lift being repaired"
"Its ok to stay if you want accessibility as its in Kuta Center. I find the he hotel room dark, though its big spacious room but doesnt have much interior or anything on it. Like a waste of space. The toilet and shower room is separate. Breakfast is meh."
Room could do with a renovation as bathroom was not the best with shower not working properly. Single beds were not good for tall people and room lighting was dark. Lovely rooftop pool and breakfast area.
"I wasn't expecting much for the price but the room had a certain smell when i checked in. The tiles were popping out. Towels beds were clean.  Location was great though. dirty toilet. Shower head had rust. 
For short transit stay, was bearable"
"Location is recommended
Breakfast at rooftop was nice.
Unfortunately requested for high floor sea view get room at the last back end facing walkway. Ground floor.
The worst is two single bed combined becomes king. Unacceptable"
"I think this hotel for Indonesian only, because the breakfast is Indonesian food, No cheese, butter, eggs or milk with coffee."
"Ideal for young party people, a level above backpackers, great location, no shade around pool on rooftop, pool only 1mt deep, band can be heard loud and clear from room. Some rooms have no window."
Was dirty and unkept....maybe it was due to lockdowns etc but still that's not an excuse. There are better hotels around at the same price points
"No fresh air in rooms, no windows! just aircon"
"Positive - strategic location right in front of beach and nearby marts and malls.
Room is sufficient for 2 people and bathroom is very small.
Negative - towels are not fresh it seems. AC in room is away from bed so will take more time for coolness to reach to you.
Staff is not very good. I called for luggage pick up at checkout and no one came and then I went to out to find someone. 
This hotel is very strict with its belongings, don't ever break anything here or you'll be ripped off.
In my opinion, this place should not be first choice."
"in hotel was no towel, and I asked for hair dryer... Also no."
Overpriced. Rude staff. Water leaking from the roof. Water smells terrible in the bathroom with no hot water in the shower late at night. On a positive note the trainee staff at the seven bar for Dinner and Breakfast were extremely friendly and helpful I sincerely hope the the sake of the hotel owners that the trainees replace the Rude full time staff at the hotel with the exception of the host at the dinner BBQ he was extremely helpful and friendly.
Called to defer stay due to covid and have had no response
"We ran into a situation that was not good. Next room to ours a lady was screaming and crying as she was being assaulted by a man. I immediately called security and it took over 2 minutes to respond. The loud screaming of the lady in distress was not good at all. Security knock/ and rang the bell finally the door open. He comes to me then and says everything is find it was one of the officers......THAT IS NOT FIND!!! I scolded his ass and told him what assault was, that if he did not do something that I was going to call the police and we do not go around beating on women even if it is in a Muslim country. The noise was still going on as she was crying and like begging to stop. I hope she was alright. I will never go back to Kutabex Beach Front Hotel if their security is like that then it is not safe for anyone to stay there. The staff check in was friendly, nice and all but I can not grade it because of this incident and the way security staff handled the situation. Police should have been called and if it was one of his men on security involved then he should have reported it. I do not know if she was being raped or what but it was not good crying and begging to stop. I feel like as a customer I did what I could do without jeopardizing my family's security.  Beware of what goes on at Kutabex Beach Hotel while staying there. Stay safe. Terrifying experience....I still wish I would have done more....that is security's job."
"I enjoyed the hotel very much.  I had a hard time getting hot water, but for some reason, it suddenly came on.  I don't know why.  If you are determined to stay in Kuta Beach (don't recommend it, by the way), the Kutabex Hotel is a good one to stay at."
"This hotel is almost perfect! Affordable price for a spacious room, all best spots are in walking distances, perfect sunset moment at the rooftop bar, affordable cocktail prices, this hotel serves you best!
Minus:
-no windows nor balcony. To us thats not a big deal tho'
-limited breakfast choice, also not a big deal as lots of trad bf nearby
-old building, also fine as well
-noisy room....still affordable
Therefore I said almost perfect!"
"Kutabex was a last minute stop after our previous accomodation ended up being horrible, and were SO glad we moved to Kutabex, such an incredible central location and the staff were amazing the place was amazing everything was A+"
"If you looking for area that never sleep, then this hotel is for you. Located in front of Kuta beach, literally 5mins walk to the hippest mall in Bali, Beachwalk. If you can't sleep at night, then just walk about 10mins via poppies line then Sky Garden in Legian will make your night memorable"
"It was our first time staying in Kutabex. We read bad reviews about this hotel more although some are good reviews.
My wife call the receptionist to make sure that we will have a non noise room, bathroom and bed must be clean. The Receptionist answer the phone nicely and write down all our requests. To be honest, my wife was not sure whether what she requested will be given when we check in.
All the doubts suddenly disappear when we check in, the hotel location is excellent, KFN and McDonalds are about few steps from lobby, restaurants are around the hotel, Kuta beach is just across the road, etc
Please note that you must stressing to have a quiet room if you want to stay comfort otherwise you will be disturbed by the live band performance from the outside hotel lobby. No view in hotel room but they quiet smart to make the artificial outside view in the hotel room.
The elevator did not work, better to change it from elevator to, let's say, a static modern stairs if the reason is want to reduce the electricity consumption :-P
The roof ceiling in lobby and toilet in the LG floor in some are bad. Need to repair and change the new one for better hotel image."
"Please check the map. The hotel is not really beach front. Our room had no windows and it was only a fake window design. The room was just enough for two persons. The bed was comfortable enough. Staff are friendly. The room and bathroom were clean. There were toiletries, bottled water, and welcome drinks to avail in the seven bar at the roof top. We requested to have our breakfast to be prepared earlier and they gave us a breakfast box which includes different types of bread, jam, butter, fruits, and bottled water. There was a big column in our room so it was quite uncomfortable. There was just a miscommunication because we asked where to claim our breakfast box and we went to the 4th floor but the staff told us that they could not prepare a breakfast yet. When I called the front desk, our breakast box was there."
"We enjoyed our stay at Kutabex, the location was great & perfect for my partner to surf & great massage parlour below the resort. The down side to this hotel was the room service wasn't great, we stayed for 4 nights and didn't have our room cleaned once, we had the towels on the floor like instructed to collect and had to call them twice to ask for new towels. The room we stayed in reminded us a lot of a basement & not natural night came in so you could never know what time of day it was without a clock. The staff were friendly &I room service was great. Breakfast was great and a beautiful top deck. I would stay again but maybe one of the higher rooms with a balcony..."
"You won't believe the rates if you will experience to stay to this hotel, from their customer service, quality of rooms and their Buffet Breakfast included. The location and view are awesome, since it is very near to the beach, you can just walk for 1-2 minutes. Hotel has a roof top where you find the Buffet Breakfast venue and the pool if you want to swim. The view is amazing where you can see entire Kuta Beach."
The hotel is very good. Located at kuta beach front area. Room is clean enough... the price is reasonable. Nice staff. Easily can find good in this area..
"Compared to other beachfront hotels, Kutabex was quite cheap. So, i didn't expect much of value it might offer. The superior rooms were mainly on the ground & lower-ground, on a long hallways. The check-in process might be frustrating, we expect early check-in because our flight was schedule to arrive at Bali way before 2PM check-in time. But the staffs insist that all guests must be checked-in at 2PM. So we waited for about 3.5 hrs before checking-in. The location was perfect, facing right in front of Kuta beach, sorrounded with Kfc, McD, Flapjacks, starbucks, and many other pubs around the hotel. Overall it was an okay stay."
this hotel is just opposite of the beach..15mins walking to hard rock cafe bali..very big hotel...rooms are clean..hve wifi..hve live bnd on lobby itself..
"It was a great stay. But the water heater is kinda hard to operate, other than that. Kutabex was a great hotel"
"Hotel staff here were by far the friendliest we had dealt with in our 7 week trip. Perfect location, nice rooms and inexpensive to stay! They have awesome live music every night at their bar with cheap drinks and nice pool tables. Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Kuta beach!"
"We stay here for 3 night we love the free wifi which is easy access within the hotel. The bed is very comfortable and staff are very friendly. It is a new hotel just across the road is the Kuta beach. The check out time only 5 min and the staff help us call a taxi to airport and taxi arrive within 1 min. The taxi is a ""blue bird"" taxi and from hotel to airport only cost us RP57,0"
"Pros:
- cheap
- location is superb
- clean rooms
- hotel was pretty spacious for the price I paid
- aircon was cold
- wifi was strong 
Cons
- for once I have nothing bad feedback. Perhaps install a hose outside the hotel for us to wash our feet before going in to the hotel? 
- Maybe get a 24 hrs security outside the hotel as the area outside is really quite rowdy at night."
"I stayed here for the rooftop pool overlooking Kuta beach. I had a lovely day lounging there and ordering drinks from the restaurant.  I booked the least expensive room, which was a little small but a good value although there was no window to the outside (but a creative job of making it feel like one). Located next to the best pizza in Bali (Pronto's)."
"The location was fantastic, price is decent for the location.
Got a universal plug from the receptionist but was spoil and there is no other available as it was limited.  Do bring your own if necessary.
Buffet Breakfast was nice and of decent variety.
Swimming pool was disappointing as the depth was low and now suitable for swimming. View was fastastic as it was facing kuta beach. 
Overall a very good stay and would come back again."
"Excellent location with great value for money, friendly staffs, comfortable room. Too bad no beach towels provided and the swimming pool is small. Kuta beach is just across the road and hotel located at the prime Brach road"
"My cousin and I stayed here for 4 nights and the location was perfect... The beach was right across the steet, the staff was awesome and night life was on the street parallel to us. Downside there are no windows and the towels are a bit run down but really... Whose staying in the hotel the whole time when the beach is across the street! Overall a good experience."
"I choose here because of their location that in front of kuta beach, glad that it also very closed with fast food restaurant, convenient store, spa, cafe and poppies I. Their Service and staff is also pleasantly. They will give you welcome drink voucher that can be use in their rooftop bar with amazing view and they also give you discount voucher to their spa."
"the things i like about this hotel are the bar and the location. it's just 3 minutes walk to beachwalk and just accross the Kuta Beach. the pool isn't so big, not what I expected. and the room isn't so spacious either. No staff took me to my room so it was confusing me where my room was and no one was there to ask"
It was a good stay. Located at one of the best spots in Bali. Great value. Room are quite comfortable. Kuta beach are just across. A short walk to Beachwalk mall. Fast food restaurant just next door. Great value for the price paid.
"Love the hotel, clean, great staff."
Clean
Comfort
PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU MAKE ORDER. I will totally no recommend this hotel. The room is AT BASEMENT. Which means no windows and can hear the sound of motor bicycle during night. You can easily hear the sound from next door. The room is dirty… I found 3 cockroaches ….. and the sheet is with blood stain … very disgusting … for budget hotel I will not recommend this one. ( don’t even mention the pool is not the same on at the roof top.)
"The beach view In front of hotel was great,  the hotel just opposite with the beach. The room was nice, clean and price was reasonable. staffs are friendly and helpful."
The tallest building in Ubud. Rooftop cafe and pool with 360 view.
"Sayang kamarnya tanpa jendela, walauoun kamarnya semua bersih"
"Used to be nice little place,rooms are old and grubby .Staff are amazing.Resurant good.Apart from dated ,old,and grubby rooms still ok only 1star and that's too much."
"I loved my stay at kutabex hotel , such an amazing location and all facilities pretty near by 👍"
I love it
Oke sih
Good
best hotel
Good hotel n clean
"If you're looking for place to just sleep and close to kuta beach with affordable price. This is the right place. But if you're looking for a hotel to enjoy along the day just in the hotel, it's better find another place. This hotel has no window, the bathroom is also small and outdated. Apart of this, it has a perfect location that close to beach, and mall.."
"We are a couple and opted for a large bed but they gave us two twin beds. So, we had to move the beds together so we could fit together. When we asked the receptionist, he just told us that the booking information they have is different from the information in Agoda.
Noisy. We can hear the noise in other rooms from our room. There is also a door in our room that could access the adjacent room. We can lock the room from inside and the adjacent room has also a corresponding door that they can lock. Sometimes, we hear the sound of the doorknob on our room turning, as if someone from the other room is trying to open it."
Best location right on the road next to the beach. The rooms are clean but no window( it’s underground) and could be cluster phobic for some. Three star facilities but a little too expensive for three stars hotel.
"The hotel is in a great location near the Hard Rock Café, Shopping and Kuta Beach. The rooftop pool is relaxing and has nice atmosphere/sunsets. The rooms are large however are located in the basement so there are no windows or balcony. I found a few small cockroaches around the sink  but this may have been a once-off.  The walls between the rooms are not very sound proof and I could hear the people in the room next to me talking. I would stay here again for the pool and surroundings but not for a long stay."
"not even worth for the money, location is great but really bad room with no window in basement and moldy air and bathroom."
"Fantastic location, breakfast and staff."
"Location was good, the beach was near by, there was a shopping centre, and poppies lane, all good
Breakfast average, the hotel was fully booked, the rooms did not have any windows.
generally has a good stay here"
"So, inter-connected room was a room with no window. The hallway outside the room was pretty and clean but a bit smelly. Inside the room was different.
Old tiles, and damp walls. What you expect for a room with no window. 
I am not hating this place, the rooftop was great, when it was open. 7-10 is breakfast, so if you havent got that included, no pool 4 u. At midmorning was closed too one day? 
Anyways, the roof is nice!
The bathroom However, in my room....
The toilet was litterally placed so close to the wall in front that my knees and nose were up against it and i still didn't sit propperly. Used the toilet on the roof.
But at least the service was good-? We were woken up the first morning at 8:46 after a night out, by the phone. Friendly reception thought they would let us know that there was just 1 hrs left of breakfast? A very urgent need i suppose? And the calls kept coming.
On the day of checkout they were friendly enough to disturb again at 11:01, 11:10 and 11:26, to remind that checkout was due at 12.
Did not feel invited, did not feel relaxed and did not feel at all a 4 star service. 
But the pictures and location are good, so i suppose people will keep booking.
I suggest to find a hotel 1 or 2 blocks from the beach and pay the same for a better venue."
Very nice
"Small room, no windows :/"
"Came with my Wife and 2 young children for 3 nights stay. The exterior of the hotel looks rundown and the room is actually in basement without windows. My Wife is disgusted with the sight of cockroaches and we noticed that the bedsheets are not changed during our time there. We also requested for 2 more extra towels for our 2 children but were told that there are extra charges.
On the 2nd day, we went out at around 8am and reminded that staff at counter that we wanted housekeeping to be done before we are back but we arrived in our room at 12+ and room is not being cleaned. We went to the counter 2nd time and told them we want it to be cleaned now while we go for lunch. When we are back at 1+ it is still not done. We have to ask the counter the 3rd time before someone came and tidy up our room while the kids are trying to sleep.
Water heater was faulty too.
The only good thing is location is good and the view at rooftop is nice."
"Stayed on the lower ground very closetophobic.  Room always smell of sewer. 
Bathroom and toilet in one with independent hot water system but no area to keep towels from being wet when showering. 
Great location for shopping and other things around kuta though.
Disaapointed"
"I was impressed by the staffs'  friendliness as well as the rooftop's pool and restaurant. You can simply enjoy your stay here by going up to the top, have drinks and meals, and swim with awesome athmosphere either in the morning, sunset or evening."
"Pro- quiet room, good AC, great breakfast.
Con- Kuta wasn’t really for us."
"Windowless room
Dirty shower
Disgusting towels
No soap
Just don’t do it"
"It was a good room, though the shower smelt not so good, not sure why. But we did not mind because we only slept there and was gone the rest of the time. Would consider again especially if we have a busy tour."
nice hotel
"Location is very near to the airport and is beach front.
The staff are all nice & friendly but their English is hard to understand.
The air conditioning and bed are AWESOME!!!
Bathroom is kind of weird but still okay. Water pressure is kind of low. 
Pool and pool are is nice even if the pool is small.
Overall, I will definitely recommend this hotel if you are on a budget."
Dirty walls and sheets got marks. No hot water to shower in geyser not working properly. Very noisy was close to other hotels lobby and could here all the phones ringing.
"It was resonable price . Also, It was included breakfast and breakfast  buffet was very good. Hotel commendations  for drink & massage discount . 
I am really recommending massage . 
They are very good price and  nice."
700
it's a strategic hotel right at fron of kuta beach. You can walk less than 5 minutes to reach Beachwalk mall. Will visit again next year.
rooms in basement
Will make sure to inform all holiday makers that the rooms are shocking with no natural light.  Underground rooms at the beach. Unbelivable .
Room is dirty and smelly...
Room no view
"Great roof top pool and bar to relax and unwind from the shopping and dining. The beach is also right out the front door and across the road. Friendly helpful staff. Nice breakfast buff with live cooking stations and a nice variety of hot and cold items.
The only negatives. Poor wifi. Dusty aircon and strange bath design."
"Hotel was in a great location and staff was excellent. 
Started with room in basement, However was very musty smell (carpet in room) so we moved to 1st floor in smaller room
But no carpet or smell.
Overall satisfied."
"Very warm greetings from the staff. Room was tidy and comfort.  Easy access to nearby attraction areas - Kuta Beach (exactly in front of the hotel), nightlife, shopping malls, etc.  Foods - need to be improved (add more variety of international foods) since the hotel offer more on local foods (but the taste was OK). The only drawback is, i found the cockroaches when i open the cupborad. The management need to have pesticide control schedule at least once a month to overcome this problem (have told this problem to the management during check-out). Overall - SATISFIED."
"ac is not properly working, the wall of the room is so thin that you can barely hear “something” happening in the next your room."
No sea view room even no room have balcony/ varanda
"The location is great , aircon is broken , is terrible stay experience"
Sleep underground.. no room at higher than ground...room dirty and no window...all room are same
"Just in the front of Kuta beach, near from Legian and other entertainment venues"
very nice
Good value for money
will surely come back
"Great locations, all rooms located in ground level"
"Near to every where,front of the hotel is kuta beach,recommended hotel"
Short stay loved the cocktails by the pool. Small rooms quite dark but clean.
"Yes! The beach was very near to the hotel, staff was incredibly kind and several shop the options around the hotel. My only critique would be that the swimming pool was rather small"
The bed is quite big and comfortable. Easy to walk to the beach and shopping mall
Thier staff attitude.
You can see the PRICE on your bed side if you broken. Too many rules
"centrally-located hotel, value for money, staff very friendly , the room was spacious& clean. Love the view!:)"
"I was here with my group 35 people, all of us accomodated well. Breakfast was good, and the pizza behind the hotel was soo good. It also have nice roof pool."
"a/c was good, no windows so made feel enclosed. rooftop pool was small. Views from rooftop amazing !!! I enjoyed that the most. great location to busy kuta road. close to restaurants and beachfront"
"The location is good as it is at the beach front. Rooftop attractions are great and the services are wonderful especially during the breakfast.  However, the magnetic locking mechanism of the room door was a total failure.  We need to ask for assistance every time we need to get in the room. We reported it accordingly but nothing has been repaired. We asked for an hour late check-out due to the inconveniences but the supervisor only gave us half an hour extension."
"the location was great, unfortunately there is no windows in the room, breakfast was excellent."
"I had wonderful time staying there for 2 nights. I paid $45 per night including taxes, breakfast and dinner. Best value of my money."
"We had to change rooms 3 times in four days and have been sick ever since .There is a mold smell in all hallways and black mold in every bathroom ,it smells so bad we could not sleep .We have both been sick since we left and will never ever step one foot in there again as it ruined our whole trip and hopefully not our lives .They even came in a tried to scrub it off but it didn't work ,I feel so sorry for the nice people working in there .They have great staff but a terrible owner who doesn't fix this problem ,not one opening window in the whole place .It was just disgusting DO NOT GO THERE ."
"Room is clean ,staff is friendly and efficient.  Breakfast was alright."
We had to go to the bar to ask for the welcome drink and the voucher has it's time on it.
"PRO:
Unbeatable location, in front of Kuta Beach, surrounded by everything you'll need in Bali.

CONS:
Horrible & dishonest staffs although friendly faced. Upon check-in, front desk staff said room wasn't ready and we were fine to wait at lobby. But in about 2 minutes, magically they said room is ready. Turns out they cheated by giving us the cheaper & smaller room (Superior 22sqm) instead of the more expensive Deluxe room (30sqm) that we paid for 2 nights. As avid travellers, we definitely know the difference between 22sqm & 30 sqm. But due to exhaustion after long journey, we don't want to argue no more.
Also when requested 2 key cards, they refused and gave ridiculous excuse: they didn't have enough card material!!! For god sake, it's only plastic and it's a norm at hotels to give at least 2 key cards.
On check-out, even more outrageous & unbelievable thing happened. Front desk staff accused us of smoking in the room and insisted to impose fine, which was unbelievably insane considering we were staying with children and weren't even a smoker. After some argument and they still insisting, I suggested us to walk back to watch the 'evidence' in the room. When we passed our room, only then they realized they have made 'FATAL' mistake. They were mistaken our room with others and at the time there was only 1 guest at the front desk (me alone), how can they mistake my room number with others and don't believe their own guest."
"- Took a standard 2 person room, the bed size was good, but the sheet, towels and even toilet has stains, so didn't look clean.
- Saw few bugs running around on the table and floor.
- no mirror in the room, but had a huge mirror out side the window, which I found odd.
- nothing to place our personal toilet trees in the toilet/ bathroom.
- and my personal preference would be a Muslim shower instead of the mechanical butt washer inbuilt to the toilet seat."
"For those who are on a budget and not concern about being claustrophobic, disregard my following frustrations. Otherwise read on to safe guide your expectations moving forward.

Firstly, not anywhere in Agoda's website will you be informed that all their rooms are located in basements, with their highest being on ground floor. Yes we were aware from past reviews of such concerns, thus we wrote in for higher level room. FYI, Kutabex manages their hotel's infos on Agoda itself. So which means Kutabex can say whatever they want and we are left to believe its legitimate.

Till the day we arrived there wasn't any reply with regards to our special request. Only to be told upon check-in that their rooms are below. Rooms of higher floors will cost you 3-5 Juta and its under the management of ACCOR! With immediate we had to find alterative!

But I would have to give credit to Agoda whom understood my frustrations and will be refunding my initial hotel charges. This great customer service is solely by Agoda itself and NOT Kutabex whom still isn't willing to negotiate. Finally I honestly wish Kutabex would be blacklisted by all travel sites as one of those untrustworthy hotel in Bali."
Will definately consider to stay here again
"Nice hotel and good BF, the beach is in front this hotel
feel annoying when the receptionist asked me to sign the agreement about none smoking room and facility broken charge but found that the sheets if full with stained and when check out they checked it very long like they think i dont know the sheets conditions."
"Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom. Rooftop pool. Enjoying sunset at rooftop.
Great stay, although there is no window in the room.
Will coming back here next time."
Good location
