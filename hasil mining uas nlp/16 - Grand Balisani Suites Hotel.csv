"Hello I'm Thomas  After a week long wedding event in Australia. Being so far East on the world map decided ""5 hour flight to Bali"" Why Not...I stayed in 3 separate hotels between Seminyak, Jimbaran and then Grand Balanase Suites..in fairness all 3 hotels were excellent in all their own ways.  Grand Balanase Suites was amazing yes their location makes a difference to me nothing makes me happier in life when I can look directly at a beautiful ocean 30ft away and then opt for the pool instead .
Truly appreciate the staff's attentiveness,  genuine caring and willingness to assist. 
Food..WOW... Great experience. Would highly recommend this hidden Gem in Bali"
"The resort was very nice an beautiful.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The place was clean and we'll maintained.  The location was perfect, within easy walking distance to restaurants and beach bars.  The shopping is an easy 10 to 20 minutes away by cab.  They have a nice pool with swim up bar.  The breakfast buffet was always good with plenty of selection, eggs to order and great pastries and breads.  I would highly recommend it, especially for families, as I saw many families with children having a great time.  The beach is directly in front of the hotel and nice for wading, however, the waves and current are dangerous for swimming and surfing.  For that you must travel 20 to 45 minutes to one of the many other beaches."
"We stayed here for three weeks the third week as our flight out was cancelled we booked for three days' time and that was cancelled so  we had again to book a further four days. Our visa also expired. The reception staff were brilliant finding accommodation, phoning immigration finding an English speaker and gave directions to a taxi. Thank you Poalina 
All the staff were wonderful providing exceptional service.
We had a sea view room which had great views from the balcony. this was on the fourth floor however this property has no lifts so would not be suitable  for some.
The location is right on the beach front all set in magnificent tropical gardens
We will certainly return to this resort"
"I believe this hotel is old from their design, furniture, and the amenities. No elevator, we got room on the 4th floor facing the beach. We didn't managed to go to the beach due to weather but overall nice hotel, breakfast could be improved with variety everyday please..."
"Super nice property the pictures don’t do it justice. Very big and comfortable suite that we found on an excellent deal. The only consistent problem was mosquitos, more than anywhere else we stayed in bali and nusa penida. We finally got it kind of figured out but it was by the end our stay in balisani suites. So just make sure you bring plenty of mosquito repellant to wear day and night and also mosquito repelling incense we placed outside of each entrance to the suite. Otherwise they will be biting you all day and as you sleep! This is not however the hotel’s fault and will not take away from their review at all. Very Very nice place and a steal for the price($50 for a typically $150 dollar suite).
P.S. we got food poisoning from close by Warung Cantina so avoid that restaurant!"
"The hotel is old, and many will say needs refreshing, but it’s clean, the sheets are fresh and the rooms are spacious, many with awesome views of the waves crashing on the almost deserted beach front.  Located in a delightful quiet pocket just around from the busy everything In Seminyak. Food is average but not expensive,  better fare can be found at the warungs on the beach,  where a lazy afternoon is easily spent.  The pool is clean with different depths to cater to all ages and not overly busy. Very easily to nod off on a sun-lounger the vibes are so relaxing.  Have to also mention the spa where the massages are the best we had in our three weeks in Bali. We will definitely come back to Bali Sani."
"The staff at balisani would do anything for you!! The fact that we have seen the same faces for over 10 years is testimonial to the hotel looking after its team that in turn are wonderful with the guests!
We also love the beach bars in that strip and have watch it grow!!
Highly recommend!!!"
"Beautiful place to stay, lovely close to beach & great restaurants not too far away. Had some great massages at the on-site spa & cocktails at the pool bar. Ponds & water features with fish right near rooms created a beautiful atmosphere too."
"We stayed here for a week with our two girls 3 years and 7 months and loved it! We had a suite which was a great size very close to the pool which meant we could let bubs nap whilst we relaxed by the pool. Everything was clean and tidy, air con was usually too cold (good problem to have) there was good uncrowded surf out front, all staff were very helpful and kind, daughters loved the pool and walking along the beach in the morning. A nice quiet and relaxing holiday! We will definitely be back next time!"
I like this place a lot. Traditional Bali charm right on the beach with all the comforts. Nice big rooms with balcony and great bathroom. Excellent staff and the restaurant does great food at reasonable prices. Handy stores nearby. Highly recommended.
So bad just stayes here for 1 night. Even didn't enjoy the swimming pool 🙈 The place totally good. Because beach view and closed to many places. All the staffs so nice and helpfull
"Grand Balisani is not a luxury resort but it is clean, friendly and good value for money.  It’s right on the beach, has a swim up bar, has excellent rates for massage (below most resort prices and very pleasant surroundings). Staff are friendly, breakfast (included) is quite good. There is a nightclub next door and the music is incredibly loud (but stops at 10 pm most nights). GB is good for a cheap and cheerful getaway."
"Grand Balisani has one of the nicest pools in all of Bali; and it comes with a swim up pool bar too!
There was quite a lot of traffic around the area, but the hotel was quite lovely and was not too far away from Canggu."
"I really enjoyed my stay, rooms large with a sea view, balcony & very clean. Great staff & massage at the spa. Breakfast was included. Thanks Nerida"
"This is the 2nd time we have stayed at Gran Balisani and for my wife and I , it was ideal.
 Right on the beach, excellent pool, swim up bar, good size rooms, lovely Balinese gardens, happy and engaged staff, good location and great value for money."
"We arrived at the Grand Balisali, after a horrendous experience at another hotel. (I will save that for another review). The hotel staff is exceptional and accommodated us and added another bed so we had enough room for our party.  The rooms are spacious and clean, sure the place could use a little updating, however after the tourism industry crashed here during covid, they are slowly getting back to status quo.
The location is very convenient.  Right on the beach.  The pool is well maintained with a swim up bar.  The restaurant serves buffet style with enough choice for most folks.  Expect to pay a little more than average for the meals here, but the view overlooking the ocean, and live music in the evenings was worth it.
The hotel offers traditional Balinese cooking classes daily during lunch time.  You even get a little certificate.  
Right now finding a hotel in Bali that lives up to its “reviews” online is hard.  Trust the most recent reviews if you want an honest option of where you’re going.  Not everyone has the same expectations, and experience, but we felt well taken care of while at the Hotel.
The spa is very inexpensive for the time and care they put into your treatments.  The hotel gives you a discount on a traditional Balinese massage upon arrival.  Worth it after a long trip and recovering from Jet Lag!  
There are quite a few steps at the entrance and getting around the grounds to consider if you have mobility issues.
A shout out to the exceptional staff here, who made our stay as comfortable as possible!"
Had a great stay at Balisani. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to all requests. Location very nice on the beach with plenty of sunbeds on the property around the pool. Price was very favorable so definitely recommended for a hotel stay in the Seminyak area.
"This hotel is like old beautiful Bali!!! 
The ambiance, with alang alang roofs and neat Bali garden style. A nice pool by the ocean. The chosen furniture to the room. I was staying in a Garden suit. I could see and hear the ocean.  The very big bathroom had beautiful stone carvings on the wall. Shower was the best I had in years.  Hot and plenty of water. Four polar bed with beautiful textile in the “ceiling”, great luxury bedlinen. Everything reminded me of old Bali (came first time in 1986.) Today it is very rare to find places like this, Bali has changed a lot (I liive in Bali). Today  many think modern is the best. Modern style that you can find everywhere in the world. This style you will not find anywhere else than in Bali. This is a tru gem!"
"Great position on the beach, nice pool, friendly staff and best of all the gardens and architecture are old Bali style which is beautiful.  Reasonable pricing can walk along beach to W Hotel for a cocktail!"
"The location was excellent.  Lovely pool, plenty of space.  Everything I needed. Close to so many  great restaurants"
"Awesome hotel in a perfect location to everything ! Staff are the nicest people in the world 
Highly recommend this hotel"
I’m sure this is not gonna make it on their website because the hotel was actually good but because I booked through their app I ended up getting screwed over in more ways than one not being able to upgrade my say losing a day because my flight got delayed do not use this app it is the worst thing you can do plus you get the hotel cheaper if you don’t use this the book
loved the big room and the pool! Staff is really great.
Awesome secret gem of a hotel in seminyak. Right on the beach with hugggggeeee rooms.
My mom and i loved our time at Grand Bali Sani ; Thank you 🙏🏽
"Nice Hotel, with great swimming pool and nearby the beach. Staff  at the reception could be more kind, and massage therapists too. Restaurant is extremely overpriced for the quality and quantity it offers."
I loved staying at this hotel. The pool is gorgeous and right next to the beach. The gardens are beautiful and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. I like that thus place still retains the feel of traditional Bali. I’d stay here again. Rates are very reasonable.
Good place for couples
Great place for staycation with beauty beach.
"The staff were amazing, great facilities, swim up pool bar, pool table. Would definitely recommend staying here !"
"Perfect Location, great value for money, and amazing staff. Located bang on the beach in the heart of Seminiyak, nothing is far from the hotel. I think this will be my fixed hotel everytime I visit Bali."
"Can't wait to come back here,"
LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
"Great place located directly at the beach and close to the Center. Breakfast was delicious and the view fantastic. Nice spa options, friendly staff."
"Loved our stay. Not many oldstyle Bali hotels exist like this anymore. 
Staff were great and room was a great size.
Happy customers."
Absolutely loved it
"Great location,  absolutely wonderful staff and service.  This was our 2nd trip and will definitely be back.  Also great for families."
"The hotel is old as people said in their reviews, but the glamour from old times doesn't fade. I really enjoy the local Balinese master plan. From the traditional wooden bed, outrageous wood-carving doors, three layered window, stone carving statues to the carefully looking-after layered garden. They've successfully turned a  traditional house into a modern hotel. The room is very spacious with a balcony and a toilet. The toilet is  with both shower and bathtub and is half size of the room. If you don't care about architecture that's fine, but you will definitely fall in love with the beach front view. I simply enjoy a beach walk to Canggu or seminyak. For example you can walk to Potato Head or Finns club. Ya, by enjoying the beach walk without all the hustle from a  motor ride, you can go to young and funky club gracefully. The restaurant is not vegan friendly but the coffee is very good. It is a high cp value hotel compared to other beach front hotel. I might choose this hotel again."
Have visited before..and standards here are still high
Super friendly relaxed atmosphere and right on the beach
Fabulous location and spa treatment
Breakfast was very good
Great place to stay
The best value for ocean front views. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The food was tasty and service quick. Won't find better value for money at this great beach front hotel
"This is an older hotel, but the grounds are fantastic and facing the beach with easy access and a small road up to the W hotel. Gardens are manicured, you feel Bali, but what was outstanding was the hotel staff who go out of their way to help."
"I had a lovely stay at Balisani in a garden suite villa- the standout feature was of course the location. Batu Belig is a relatively quiet and clean beach with easy access to the nightlife of Seminyak and Canngu. This property is close to the beach and moreover the veranda of my villa was literally frontal to the beach- less then 50 meters. 
The rooms themselves are spacious with a rustic Balinese touch. Of course, they could do with some refurbishment, particularly the bathroom fittings. The food and cocktails although reasonably priced and wholesome could be more exciting and the staff was typically Balinese friendly with the exception of perhaps one of the receptionists. 
This isn’t the place for refined luxury however if you seek comfortable accommodation in an unbeatable beach location at great value, then this is your place. Yes, it could very easily be enhanced with some minor upgrades and creativity however I cannot possibly complain given the price I paid!"
Lovely old style balinese hotel. Fantastic location and amazing staff. Our go to place when we land in Bali. Spotless rooms and lovely location on the beach. Fabulous pool.
A good old style hotel right on the beachfront.  Great breakfast provided.  If you don’t want to eat at the hotel there are a number of bars on the beach just nearby - good for a sunset beer in a beanbag.
"Big room, closed to beach club, beach front swimming pool and great staff"
"Pay 3 stars for 5 stars view.
Walking distance to potato head and W hotel and there is a beach club accross the hotel.
Many food places nearby.
My 2nd time and will stay here again,definitely."
"Food can improve with more options, otherwise not bad at all."
"We stayed in the Sani villa on the north end.
Villa itself is beautiful, especially the main suite with huge bath and heaps of space. Was really nice sitting around the pool watching the waves crash on the beach. Negative is that there is a beach club right next door and the music is loud. The windows don’t shut any of the noise out. I would recommend staying at the villas at the south end and you probably would be fine. Breakfast was ok, grounds were beautiful, and lots of really cool Warungs  down the beach to chill out on beanbags on the beach. Walking distance to Finns, potato head, mrs Sippy, and Mari (which is right next door)."
"Lovely hotel right on the beach front. Friendly staff. 
Only downside drinks were very expensive, but just to the left, on the beach were a few lovely restaurants with great cheap food and drinks."
"The hotel staff we all amazing, friendly and helpful.  We did a cooking class which was so good and the food we cooked was great.  The staff in the swim up bar and staff in general could not do enough for you.  Would highly recommend this place and we will be staying there again."
"This property was a good surprise, location is excellent, the facility is very good, spacious & comfortable.
Staff is very friendly and helpful, in particular the restaurant and bar service (Febri is an amazing person!).
We would certainly go back there and can recommend it to everyone."
"The buildings that make up the resort are older, so it's not a new 5star type place. But where it counts it has everything you need. Rooms are spacious and clean, beachfront access, lobby and restaurant are bright and clean. Pool has a swim up bar. At night a guy on a guitar plays and sings some class songs. 
Had one of my best massages at the spa at this resort.
Using The ""grab"" app to hire a bike driver it didn't cost more than $1.5 to get a bike to the bar scene in seminyak. There are some nice small cafes, spas, and liquor stores nearby. A few beachfront bars/restaurants are also just outside the resort along the beach you can walk to.
Of you're looking for value for money for a beach front place"
It was our second time staying! Love to come.back again. Thanks
"Hotel was excellent. Executive Room was awesome! Hotel could do with small revamp.
Staff are super friendly. 
You can hire scooter through hotel. 
They have doctor on call 24hours incase of emergency. 20min and the doctor was at our door at 4am also with excellent service.
Swimming Pool is spacious and also on the beach front.
The only disappointment is the dirty beach.
And the Hotel food could do with improvement and better variety."
"This is in a greqt location, right on the beach, a bit busy on the street and takes a bit of time to get anywhere, however there are some nice restaurants within walking distance."
This place is right in between the beach clubs of Seminyak.
"The hotel has direct access to the beach. Spacious room, Balinese design, nice swimming pool, average breakfast, limited parking if you bring your car, poor WiFi. During our stay, we enjoyed the beach, side beach cafes, luckily the hotel is sound proof of the hustling and bustling of Seminyak area, and music from nearby clubs and cafes.
If you like night life, this hotel is perfect for you. Surrounded by night clubs and trendy cafes."
"The place is a little old but Rustic. The hotel staff attempt their best to serve people in their capacity with some minimal expectations which may / may not be met at times. Again the place is beautiful for a getaway from crowds and facing ocean on the doorstep. For a relaxing holiday, this is the place and the gardens, the landscape is very calmning. Hotel Staff such as ECO / ADI / NIOMAN & ASST. Manager Lady / Dining staffs & the Receiption staff were absolutely accommodating for random requests for myself and my wheelchaired mom. Definitely value for money if you want a quiet staycation. 
-Narzee"
"This a great & strtegic hotel by the beach and surrounded by newest beach club, shops within walking distance, cafe and resto.
Since they dont have lift facility, so ensure if travel with older people they do not have any restriction on taking stairs (even actually, its not too high though)"
This review is applicable for Sea View room only
"After a bumpy start checking our group in, the staff went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the buildings are beautifully maintained in traditional Balinese style. The pool is lovely (with a bar attached) and the large grassy gardens are just over the road from the beach. Breakfast was basic but tasty and the spa was really nice and well priced. I would happily stay here again."
Staff Is super friendly and helpful.
"Excellent value for location, efficient and friendly staff."
"This is a traditional older hotel directly on the beach in Seminyak. The limitations is the new beach club next door with on some days creates back ground noise that I did not appreciate (but never after 11 pm).  I also moved from one of their lush bungalow suites into a smaller room in their main building, which I have found much more quiet.  I am enjoying my stay and considering the very reasonable price, I consider this hotel a very good deal.  Andreas S."
"best location, near to the beach"
"The washroom wasn't super clean. I had to buy few products and clean it by myself. It felt like it hasn't been cleaned for months.
After the rain the frogs came out. Too much noise i couldn't sleep.
The staff are friendly, location is good. You can go around by walk to several places."
"best location, near to the beach"
"It's a great spot and easy to cut through into town using the beach.
Staff are good.  Pool is great."
"Great view, old hotel, staff was good"
"Hotel by the beach, soooo recommend.
Will be back to this hotel."
Staff where amazing building very old and in need of work but nicely located near beach and has a real traditional Balinese feel
"A nice place to stay, away from the hustle and bustle. Friendly staff, a decent breakfast (order one of two options) and a good swim up bar.
Also some good beachside warungs, nit as crazy as the ones nearer Kuta.
Would definitely recommend."
Value for money
"Bali sani is a  more traditional style architecture, good size rooms , pool,  beautiful gardens over looking beach and simple beachfront cafes
 Bit tired but very good value with all you need"
"Had all the facilities you need 
Rooms are decent nothing luxurious but comfortable.
Staff were great"
"The place is real nice, also a very good location at Batu Belig. Sometimes noisy at the pool side, loud music and families with children 😉"
"For our last few nights in Seminyak, this was an affordable option compared to some more expensive hotels around.
Pros: right on Batu Belig Beach (Canggu end), swim up pool bar, spacious rooms with good AC. style of hotel is quite old/outdated however did have a certain Balinese charm to it.
Cons: location while on the beach is very far from Seminyak Main Street area and has a very busy road which is almost impossible to travel up at certain times of the day - scooter hire is a must!! We found pricing at this hotel very expensive for food, drink and scooters in comparison to elsewhere - they also whack on a 21% surcharge to bills. When we went to check in; we were left waiting an additional 45mins past the 2pm checkin time as they weren’t ready on time - this was frustrating but not the end of the world.
All in all, I’d still say great value if you don’t mind being a little further out of the hustle and bustle"
"Slightly aging,but a lovely place on the beach"
"Old traditional Indonesian resort. Staff are nice. Breakfast is okay. Overall, it’s okay as we’re mostly out."
"Great view, old hotel, staff was good"
"If the building asthetics are important to you, then this is not for you. While the interior of the resort is clean and well maintained, the buildings are dull, grey and mouldy. A coat of paint is all it would take."
Rooms  and pool were nice
"Resort is not suitable for guests not able to climb steps as it do not have any elevator. If you are not fussy and aftering to dine at warungs and beach front resort this might be for you.
However if you expect high end, great breakfast property, suggest you look else where.
To us, you get what you paid for.
Breakfast is simple but food are edible though coffee might not be the best but again, go out to the warungs 100m away get your expresso or cappuccino."
"The place looks like you are staying in some ancient temple with fish ponds and lush gardens.
Don't expect good communication from the staff by email though, or for an Airport transfer."
"It’s understandable  that things are not up to expectation yet but more maintenance is needed here. 
But the rest are great"
"Careful when booking last minute deals as you don’t get the ‘delux garden view with double bed’ only twin beds. ‘Subject to availability’ said the lady at counter, we only booked the room one hour before arriving so obviously have rooms reserved for special deals but you don’t get what you expect. Garden courtyard off bedroom you do get! Towels were tiny! Lovely old hotel, greenery and fish ponds make it cooler in hot climate."
"Great location on beach , pool, gardens, good sizerooms. Towels ,sheets need to be replaced. Not many TV channels. Ok for price"
"The rooms and the pool are good but their customer approach is questionable. I was already staying at the Deluxe room when I asked to book a Garden Suite for 1 month. They confirmed me the price by WhatsApp. When I went to the reception to pay for my extension a few days later, they said that the price would be 4 TIMES higher. Unimaginable!"
"Spacious room and big hotel. Nice pool facing the beach. Have a side gate link to the beach, very convenient. Some cafes (good for dinner) and happening hotels with activities along the beach. Helpful staff.  Small minimart just outside hotel.  Otherwise, location is not convenient to find food in the day. Hotel food taste was slightly below mediocre. Room quite old. Tap water weird tastes and salty,we were supplied 2 bottles of mineral water daily and we used it to brush teeth. Safe was spoilt, poor tv reception, charging point spoilt but prompt service when called to repair. Dim room. Not friendly for those with gait problem as there was many steps to climb to the reception.  Othereise, it was just value for money"
"close to beach and well maintained hotel. few faults like the bedding and breakfast, other than that nice hotel with easy beach access!!"
"Good location on beach.  Older style hotel nice gardens, pool, quiet location. Can walk to seminyak and canggu aling beach front"
"close to beach and well maintained hotel. few faults like the bedding and breakfast, other than that nice hotel with easy beach access!!"
"We recently holidayed with another couple and found the Accommodation to be very good. We did ask to move rooms after the first night due to loud music from the Nightclub across the road.  The Staff were very accommodating. We were in a Garden villa which was a very large room and bathroom. Bed comfy, lovely clean linen and towels. Pool was great with lots of sun beds. Great breakfast. It is at the far North end of Seminyak and about a 1.5 beach walk to Seminyak square. Would definitely recommend to stay here."
"Very nice place in Seminyak, a bit far from the centre but very nice and clean place. Quiet and not expensive. Personnel very kind.
Absolutely value for money"
"the downside was unclean and dusty rooms. Dim lighting.
 The good things was a decent breakfast and a super view of the sea from the bfast area"
"Interior is clean. Exterior is dull and mouldy looking. No direct ocean view, need to look over buildings & roof tops to view ocean. No lifts. Pool and food is reasonable."
Bed was rock hard. Pillows the same. Next door to a noisy night club. Staff were friendly. Nice place for breakfast. Pool nice. Seemed to be a lot of mosquitoes around at night in room.
"Une semaine de cauchemar ! A great disaster ! We had a garden suite (kananga1). Just 10 meters from the music band very loud. Sleeping impossible ! We will not recommand. We moved to another marvellous hotel in kuta(bitang bali resort 5 star) for same price with private beach. Fantastik! So, grand balisani to be absolutely avoid! A fuir!"
"Nice big, clean Balinese style room, friendly staff and a great breakfast"
Rooms are old not upgraded with weak wifi coverage. Shower and water is salty
"In the risk of being harsh after Covid. The hotel is dated, dirty and lacked the Bali vibe.  I can see it was once there. But the service lacked and the staff could have been friendlier. Great location and staff were cleaning whilst we were there so perhaps they are still properly re-opening. We got a good deal so still value for money."
"The property is dated and it's little bit out the way from main seminyak beach area. Plus there's a few annoying and unnecessary charges (E.g., 50K IDR for a lost room card). On the plus side the pool area is great and the staff are lovely, so it's not a bad place, but for the price - there are much better potions in the area."
"Pros
1. Good location on the beach and near to Seminyak town
2. Nice balinese design and cosy ambiance 
3. Friendly and attentive waitress Susri at restaurant 
Cons 
1. Untrained front office staff, gave me a Room 133 with faulty hot aircon, insist that aircon was working but technicians in front of me confirmed aircon condenser broke down. We insisted to change room and was transferred to Room 136 with powerful aircon. Why do you sell rooms that are not working and give us all the trouble to unpack and repack up to transfer room near to midnite ??
You did not even follow up with us after we moved to new Room 136 to double check if everything was ok, this is standard SOP in all hotels on basic follow up courtesies.
Other hotels with same bad experience have apologized with an upgrade to a Suite and offered free massages and fruit baskets BUT you just shift us out and pretended nothing was wrong, 
your General Manager need to wake up from s deep sleep and come out of his ivorytower"
But it looks old and need some renovations
There is a dirt road between hotel and the beach - sad.
"The staff greet with you with advanced warnings of fees you will receive if you do not follow the hotel's rules and procedures, such as fines you will incur if you lose a room key.  The facility feels like its in need of an update and freshening."
"Room was run down and dirty. Had sewage smell in room 3 times in 2 days from another room blocked toilet. Left early. Middle nowhere with not much around. Waves were big and dangerous. 
Most of the staff were very nice and the female manager was such a lovely lady to deal with when I wanted to leave. She made the experience end nicely.
Didn't realise I hadn't booked break and they wanted $15 a day. Room service was cheaper but the wrung out back had amazing food for cheap. If they supplied what the Warung did,  price wouldn't have been an issue"
Location is close beach but traffic jam going in and out of hotel.  Not many nearby eatery.  Rooms are dated.
"Though the property was in Balinese style, it was not maintained well..
Was very disappointed when we entered the corridor.. there were moulds on all the walls, passage was disgusting etc
2 stars for the service and location of the property.."
We have stayed in other authentic Bali accommodation and enjoyed it. This place needed new outdoor furniture and to replace decking etc. The room was clean. As it is located on one of the main roads to Canggu the appeal to go anywhere and get stuck in a car for hours was zero.
Was a great hotel 20 years ago. The entire hotel needs to be renovated. Book only when heavily discounted. The beach in front has tons of wood and plastic that was washed ashore. Stuff is friendly.
"Stayed in the garden suite here. Lovely room but found a poo waiting for me in the toilet, then for the rest of the stay a strong sewage smell came from the drains. Hotel could only send air freshener."
"I come to Balisani every year. This was 4th time. I was supposed to spend there 11 days. Ran away after 4. FOUR ABSOLUTE WORST DAYS! It had it all: cockroaches, angry bees, no hot water then no water at all, no wifi(even with a router in the room), toilet flushing randomly all night waking me up then toilet not working at all. To all my complaints, which I had to make at least 5-6 times A DAY, someone would come to my room, spend a minute and say ""OK miss fix!"" And leave. So I had to call over and over again. So I felt like I've wasted enough of my vacation and told them I want the rest of my money back and left. They of course pretended they didn't understand."
"Incorrectly rated hotel. Very old and needs a lot of maintenance, some buildings falling down. Taps broken in bathroom. Stinking sewer near our room. We checked out early and found another hotel."
"Bathroom and shower was pathetic.. there is a beach bar beside the hotel and its very noisy the whole night… if you’re looking for a calm and relaxed stay, avoid this hotel"
"We had an issue with flights on the day we were supposed to arrive at the hotel but the hotel never responded to my email. In fact, ever since booking several months ago I have not heard from them at all and they completely ignored my request for airport pickup.  Cannot recommend."
