"It was a nice hotel, the room is clean, the staff are kind and also the location is strategic. Nearby the beach and restaurant. However, it took more than 20 minutes for check in process even though I arrived around 6PM in the hotel. Perhaps they had a lot of customer on that day. 
So far, it was nice stay and worth the price."
"Place is clean, staff can speak good English and nice. Food is great. Complete with all you need when it comes to the hotel"
Close to the nasi goreng restaurants and Bintang bars with Bintang singlets shops.  Jungle juice nightclubs were good but I can’t remember walking back to the hotel but it’s close enough .slept on the street .
"The location is fantastic, 5 min walk to the beach, convenient stores, traditional market, and restaurants such as yoshi nova, KFC, Mcd, our local cuisines such as roast pig, and our favorite warung chef bbq ribs restaurant. 
The room is quite spacious, surprisingly has a gym and rooftop pool. Pool seems clean. Gym equipment is a bit dated, some not working. Fridge not working but was replaced quite quickly when asked. 
Room is clean, has a nice size window overlooking the city n garden. Location is safe to walk at night. Can improve on the shower water shower for constant pressure, as is, a little slow at times. Tv not clear. Ac is good. The room and floor access security system is very good. Just tap the key card on lift's panel and it goes to the right floor, no need to touch any buttons. 
Staff were fantastic. Courteous and well trained. The duty manager did a great job managing the hotel. Kudos to him n his staff. Komang was professional and patient, even helped me with calling the Intercontinental Bali Sanur Resort though another hotel. 
Took a private day tour with the hotel. No need to check outside as their price is lower. Most importantly, we felt secure since the driver is a hotel staff
The nightly price is very very affordable. Did not try their breakfast as we prefer local fares. Overall, a good stay.
Definitely a restay."

"Got massive discount from agoda. At first, me and my family doubt their cleanliness and service because we thought they are a budget hotel.
Oh no, we wrong.
Great value. Clean hotel and room. Sign of age everywhere, but that what covid did to every hotel. Good facilities but the jacuzzi is under maintanance.
But the service? Chef kiss. They try and they deliver the best service ever. No complaint, always provide. Will come again."
"The location is a bit hidden between old and abandoned shops, but it stilla good location. The staff is friendly and the room is clean."
"The hotel is a budget-friendly stay in Kuta - Bali. The staffs are really friendly and helpful. On the last day, we were almost late for the flight cause I had a mistake about the time of departure. But the hotel helped me book a car to the airport very quickly. So thank you again."

"really like this hotel. have a good staff, good loc, super clean, and really happy that i have some request and hotel give best completely for me. thank youu. will come and stay here again"
"Near every necessary facilities. Hotel have good service, very near to the kuta beach. Good food at the hotel"
"perfect stay. easy and fast check in. clean, hot water available 24/7. near of everywhere. perfect."
"comfortable, cheap, near the beach and Muslim stalls, there is a warm swimming pool, really top...."
"Very clean hotel. Cooperative staff, good rooms."
"Good place to stay, nice and clean , friendly staff just the hot shower not enough hot , it just warm but all in, it’s all good."
Everything was great at this hotel.. amazing staff that is friendly and makes customers feel welcome
Housekeeping is super good job
Improve process of checkin
Everything else is just amazing. There was very few vegitarian options. But when I asked for veg fried they prepared it for me without any extra cost . Staff behaviour was just amazing. I loved my stay here
Stayed here after the new normal. Everything met my expectations...
Very very recomended hotel with reasonable price
Good location and value for money
"good location - very close to restaurants and shops and only 5/10 minute walk from Kuta Beach! Staff were super friendly, amazing rooftop pool, good selection on their food menu! Only downside was the awful smell from the drain in the bathroom but otherwise would definitely stay again!"
The hotel is conveniently located near Legian street. The room is quite old and hot water is only available from 0600-0800 and 1800-2000 (and it's not hot enough). So if you check in outside those hours then too bad. Definitely a minus for the hotel.
"Comfortable. Value for money.
Happy."
"Staffs are friendly especially at the reception. The are well trained. The room is ok, nothing special but friendliness of staffs means a lot."
"It was good value for money. The location was fantastic with very friendly staff. Couldn’t get any hot water for the shower. Couldn’t really hang out in the room, but was great for sleeping. Jacuzzi wasn’t working at the time. 7/10 thank you!"
The place is well staffed and friendly. It is in a good location and the rooms are good.
It is very close to downtown. Very easy. And staff is very helpful.
The toproof pool is really cool. The inside garden also. Loved the premises
"We stayed here around 4days, the laundry was amazing here! We put 2 dirty white short pants and it came out super clean, thumbs up and thank you so much for the laundry team at Zia. Due to the pandemic, the hotel area were so quite and a bit scary at night. But we will totally come back here again."
"The location of the hotel is very nice. The breakfast is a bit disappointing, we arrived at 830am and most things were already gone, there was no refill. We had to ask the staff for refills. 
Room was clean so was the linen and towels."
I think hotel is good
"Good location, good price"
"I like this hotel so much
Thanks for all staff 👍"
"Everything was nice, the location was in the heart of Kuta, just 5 mnt fr beach and we are so thrilled to have our room nicely made and clean.
The only complain only that the hot shower was scheduled on 6-8 am and 6-8pm... we came late after spending night walk at Kuta beach so we missed hot shower at night and no hot water in the morning."
Reached Bali at 9pm... so to stay for a nite before me going up to Ubud is good enough. BF was not replinished fast but consider has pretty good spread.
Good hotel with friendly staffs
its close to Kuta market and beach on a very good location walkable other then that its a average hotel like 2 stars  with broken and old Amenities
"Staff were great , room service dinner  was excellent breakfast average. 
If you are after internet this was a nightmare. 
you get what you pay for. great for an overnight stay prior t o heading to the airport or if on a limited budget. I paid 30 Aus a night inclusive of breakfast."
Problem with water in the bathroom
"Good hotel around kuta, the water heater is not working when i was there"
"The wifi couldn’t be used in my room at all. They said it was because of bad weather. But when I went to some places in Kuta, i never had problem with wifi."
I booked this room based on price and location but didn’t end up staying. The hotel was very dated and needed work. The sheets and towels were stained and old.
"Totally not worth it :( 
We stay for 2 night and when come to the room , alots of dust seem like long time no cleaning the room, everything not fresh even the linen is not fresh. Look clean but then we look and sleep duat everywhere. Every night alamat noise people laughing til almost 1 am , can’t sleep well. Food not recommended also , always cold when arrived the room . There’s always trolly out the room make noise ."
"Dirty sheets ...worn old hotel...dirty every where, TV receiption what crap , staff where great and not blame them but you manger and owner need a wake up call. Paid 10 Aus dolleer for easy better and the price was triple."
"Really a bad experience 
Lost my money 
No veg breakfast 
Insects in the room 
Staff at reception really bad"
"No idea how this hotel is rated 4 stars when it is total trash. I don’t recommend anyone stay here unless this is absolutely last resort, it is a dump hole. You will definitely find nicer hotels for same price. Here are major issues encountered and why I advise you book elsewhere:
1. Power went out for 3-4 hours, major upset since I booked this hotel to charge all my stuff before flying out in a few hours. I went to airport with dead electronics. 
2. No wifi in room despite stating wifi everywhere. Jakarta airport had more reliable and extensive wifi than this dump. For wifi you have to go to main lobby where there were tons of kids running wild everywhere, screaming and yelling.
3. Gym machines all broken, treadmill would turn off after 5-8 minutes. Pretty dangerous when you’re running 8-9mph and machine totally shuts off. Physics wins, ouch! Limited hours, closed at 7pm. 
4. Hot water only during certain hours 
5. Loud, lots of sound from lobby and street. Felt echoey like a cave 
6. Overall looks dumpy and smells old"
Small room. No service.
Being very regular visitors to Bali The Zia Hotel offers not only value but a great place to call home whilst visiting Bali. A good location to all that you need for restaurants bars & shopping not far away
We booked hotel Zia for a family trip. Two rooms were booked and during booking they accepted request for higher floor.  While they provided rooms in second floor and rooms were not spacious. Requested for shaving kit and they said it was not available.
"If you want a place that’s walkable to the beach, to the shopping street, then ZIA should be on your list"
Lokasi dekat dengan Pantai Kuta dan berbagai toko/tempat makan. Walaupun menu kurang beragam namun rasanya cukup enak. Staff ramah dan sangat menolong.
Good Hotel. Clean and good staff. Price also cheap
Don’t forget anything there they will never return you assisery
"A good hotel, if you guys plan to play around Kuta Beach, literally 5 minutes walk only from the hotel to Kuta Beach. The staffs were also so so kind and helpful, enjoyed my stay there"
"Check in cepat, staff sangat helpfull, mudah dijangkau"
Overall very satisfied.. but the building construction needs to be repaired.. the breakfast menu are less varied n the coffee stand doesn't match with the hotel information in this site that has a nescafe machine...  there's no convinent parking space
Love this hotel! I always choose Zia when I am in kuta! The location is perfect not to far from the beachwalk mall! Staff are super friendly and happy to help!
"The wifi is good. The room doesn't smell bad. The breakfast is good enough.  The staffs are all professional and very helpful. The location is very good near to the center. I stayed for 2 nights, would like to extend my stay but because it is holiday season here, there was no room left. When I arrived at night, I can see little ants near the table, crawling on the wall. The air con was not cold, the refrigerator didn't work at all, the shower didnt go well, the water just came out bursting to some extend that makes the floor wet. I immediately complained the other day, and the FO manager was very professional, and very helpful. When I complained, he immediately took notes on my complain. The refrigerator itself, he explained actually is only for keeping things, not for making the drinks cold. The ants (actually I already complained the day before, the night I came, and the staffs just sprayed but actually ants still coming. Keep coming even though they sprayed chemicals to kill them. When I went out the room, the cleaning service, the engineering came to clean and fix the air con. Done very professional."
Good
WiFi is very slow and no stable
It was a nice hotel we stayed for 4 days there…
Good service
"Reasonable price, friendly​ and helpful staff, we had some problem with ac is not cold and no hot water, we rang and informed a staff and they send engineering to our room within 5  mins to fix, A day later main water pump was accidently broken we cant use a water for a half day without inform in advance we are little bit surprise​ but after they sort out the water pump issue a manager send us an apology letter with courtesy call by a staff to make sure everything​ is ok, Next day we had a breakfast​ at hotel restaurants​ unfortunately there is an criminal from outside pretended to be a guest and attend during a busy breakfast time in hotel restaurant​, while we r went to grab a food in buffet line and unaware a criminal​ was sitting behide us and stolen our bag , we lost all our money, passport, credit card and etc. After we realize that we lost our bag we reach out to Adri front office manager he instantly investgate and took us to police station, photo studio for get a photo for issue an emergency passport, next day he took us to process and passport and arrange a car for us on the they that we have to pick up a passport. We really appriciated​ his help thanks for take care of us."
"Hotel ZIA Kuta presents as offering some outstanding value, which it mostly does. However, but building is showing its age and is in dire need of renovations and repairs.
Airconditioning wasn't effective with little to no airflow, the fridge in my room didn't work and I ended up checking out several days early.
The staff were pleasant and friendly, which really helped a lot. They worked hard under the circumstances and i'm very grateful to them.
If you just want a cheap room, then go for it but otherwise, spend a bit more money if you can."
"Everything was good 
But no welcome drinks"
Staff excellent. Value for money and best locations
"the room was clean, but the washroom was just okay. Compared to the price, its good to stay for short trip. And its kinda close to the beach by walk, maybe 10 mins walk. The convenience store is 1 mins away by walk."
"Great location and very nice facilities. The breakfast buffet for 50,000 idr is a good deal."
Its near to market so easy to explore Bali market and easy for shopping
Good
Good
Good location of the hotel. Close to everything we needed. Pleasant staff here to help if needed.
"The hotel is near the beach, also it has some realy nice restauranta nearby. The personal is really friendly and helps you with all questions. There is a rooftop pool and the rooms are clean and nice."
Good
"Stayed 3 nights 4 days with family, 5 persons and 1 kid. The hotel location is near Kuta Beach, just 600 meters. And also near Legian street. Easy to find local and fast food restaurant (McD and KFC) around the hotel. Breakfast is ok, especially for the wafel. Next time if I came to Bali again, I will stay in this hotel."
Good
very good
"Staffs were thoughtful. My room aircond remote controller wasn’t working, they sent a technician right away to fix. So did my water kettle. Housekeepers cleaned my room everyday (stayed for 5 days) and refill water bottle and toilet essentials. I tried their breakfast buffet once and wasn’t a fan. Lack of taste. Nyaman lagi makanan di warong nearby there. 
The hotel is less than 3 mins walk to Family Mart (convenience store) and 10 mins walk to Kuta Beach. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly and long stay hotel, here’s one of the best in Kuta."
"Near from every place,  nice help full staff and good food too"
"Considering the very affordable price, the hotel is great. The bed is comfortable, and the breakfast is good. There is a nice view pool on the roof."
Best
Best staff
Good
Worth it.
Just fine
"El hotel es sencillo y el desayuno es muy completo para el que desayuna comida tipo fideos, etc"
Ich persönlich fand das Hotel vom Preis/ Leistung zu teuer.
"*Wifi werkte nauwelijks
* WC was 4x stuk in 5 nachten
* Airco is stukgegaan
* Wanneer iets stuk was werd er snel op gereageerd 
* Prijzen eten/wellness die op kamer lagen waren oud, bij receptie werden duurdere, nieuwe prijzen aangerekend 
* In badkamer op plank onder wastafel heeft de hele tijd haar gelegen
* Doucheputje verstopt, housekeeping doorgegeven maar liep nog slecht af"
Dicht bij het strand. Onbijt divers en elke dag anders.

"クタビーチに近くて、ジョクンでエアポートリーフに出れるので便利なロケーションです。
サーフトリップなら充分な設備で、コスパ高くて、満足です。"
プールの水は何処よりも綺麗だった。最上階で日陰にもならずプールは満点です。お早は古いから仕方ない。しかし小さなアリたちは気になる。
以前ホリディーインのメンバーでしたからよく利用していましたが以前と比べて少しがっかりでした
"Mantap... harga murah tapi tidak kaleng² pelayanan top, kamar dan kebersihan ok, buat family ok"
stafnya baik dan membantu...menu makanan juga lumayan dan rasanya juga lumayan.cocoklah buat yang budget hotelnya ga banyak.not badlah
Kami beberapa kali ke sini dengan rombongan kantor dan keluarga. Sedikit komplain ke hotel  malah dpt cashback harga 1 extra bed. Terimakasih banyak👍
nice hotel..strategic location..
"Kami datang jam 3.30 sore, artinya sdh lewat dr jam cek in, namun kamar blm siap, dan kami menunggu sampai jam 4.30 baru cek in, kami memesan 4 kamar, 3 kamar ckp baik,bersih, namun 1 kmr yaitu kamar saya, seprei ada noda ompol, dan tray kopi teh di meja banyak semut, request ganti kamar pertama ditolak dgn alasan full, tp krn sy ngotot, akhir nya diberikan kamar ganti di beda lantai oleh managernya. Sy membawa bayi usia 6 bulan, dan ini menjadi sangat melelahkan dan mengecewakan sekali."
"Saya menginap 5 malam di Hotel ZIA dari tgl 10 sd 15 Agustus sebanyak 4 kamar, kamar bersih, staff ramah, breakfast lumayan enak, shower air hangat tersedia terus, ada jaqucci air hangat dan kolam renang di lt 7, lokasi dekat ke pantai kuta, berjalan kaki kurleb 15 menit, minimarket seperti family mart dan indomart dekat, lokasi banyak orang bule pada nongkrong di cafe cafe, mantapp👍👍😍😍😍"
"Hari-hari yg menyenangkan tinggal disini. Staf yg ramah, fasilitas yg lengkap, tempat yg bersih dan dekat kemana-mana: pantai, restoran, pusat bisnis dan pusat hiburan. Untuk sarapan paginya perlu ditingkat lagi jika dibandingkan dgn hotel sejenis."
"Untuk bintang 4 pelayanan hotel sudah sangat baik, yang kurang adalah luas kamar yang terbilang begitu sempit."
"View nya bagus, kebersihan masih oke, cuma mungkin peralatan di toilet udah lama, ac nya central dingin banget jadinya hehe, nyaman kamarnya, staff nya juga ramah"
"Staf ramah dan menyenangkan menginap di sini, ke pantai hanya jalan kaki sudah smpai cm btuh 4 mnit"
Lokasi hotel dekat dengan jalan Legian dan pantai Kuta. Nyaman dan bersih. Kekurangannya di pembatasan air panas hanya pada jam 6-8 pagi dan 6-8 malam. Selebihnya ok.
还好！
"이 호텔에서 5박을 머물렀는데 돈아까워서 그냥 위생 흐린눈하고 지냈습니다.  모든 시트가 지저분하고 수건도 매우 더럽습니다. 하지만 가격이 매우 저렴하고 아주 넓은 수영장이 있습니다.
수영장에 관리자는 없지만 이용하는 사람이 별로 없어서 좋고 물이 깊어서 수영하기 좋습니다. 위치도 매우 좋은 편은 아니지만 나쁘지 않습니다."
"평점은 높은데 몇몇 안좋은 후기가 보여서 망설이다가 선택했어요.
가격대비 주변 몇몇 호텔들보다 컨디션과 서비스가 좋다고 생각해요.
마지막 2박 편하게 쉬다가 갑니다.
다음에 다시 쿠타에 오면 첫 숙소로 선택할거 같아요."
"4박5일 머물렀습니다.
침대시트 베개 커버 바닥 탁자 화장실 그 어떠한 것도 바꿔주거나 청소해주지 않아요
엄마랑 둘이 지내는데 수건을 하나 비치해주길래 하나 더 요구 했더니 이미 지급이 됐는데 왜 요구하냐며 묻더라구요
저는 꾸따에 서핑 및 풀장 물놀이 목적으로 있었기에 샤워를 하루에 두번 할때가 있었습니다.
그렇기에 수건 하나 더 가능한지 요청했더니 이 또한 자세한 이유를 요구하며 절대 친절하지도 않았습니다.
가성비 라고 하지만 여관같은 곳에서 가성비라기엔 전 너무 힘들었습니다..
여러분의 선택에 맡길게요"
위치가 가장 좋습니다
"늦은 밤 도착했을때 바요 라는 이름의 직원이 친절하게 안내해주었고 지내는 동안 그 직원 덕분에 정말 더 편하고 안전한 호텔이 되었습니다. 가성비도 정말 좋습니다. 주변에 학교? 같은게 있어 가끔 아이들 소리가 나니 귀마개를 갖고 가시면 더 좋을 것 같아요
수건은 향이 강한 유연제를 쓰는듯하니 냄새 안나는 걸 요청하는 것도 팁입니다^^"
"3년전 좋은기억으로 가성비로 다시찾았는데 지금은 별로네요
청결하지 않고 침구류 더러워요
비추합니다"
Kamar enak bersih wangi dan nyaman 👍👍 dekat dengan pantai kuta dan bar bar kuta jadi gampang cari makanan
"Breakfastnya enak menurut ku, kualitas hotel dengan harga sangatt pas. Kamar bersih nyaman besar. Ketika ada masalah staff langsung bekerja cepat. View nya dari luar kamar juga bagus. Deket juga dari pantai kuta di dekatnya juga ada indomaret tempat makan pokoknya worth it lah stay disini. Staffnya ramahh dan baik semua."
Hotelnya sangat strategis dan harganya cukup terjangkau dengan fasilitas lengkap. Staffnya cukup baik dan membantu. Terima kasih
pelayanan baik . hotelnya bagus   cuma sdkit kecewa karena di sprei nya kotor ada bekas darah atau kotoran apa itu.
"Staff ramah, pelayanan baik, di hari terakhir dapet free breakfast sebagai compliment. Nyaman banget pokoknya"
"Semuanya ok, lokasi mantap dekat kuta"
"Lokasi nya agak masuk gang, tp ttp bs di lewati mobil atau bus. Dkt dengan toko” kcl sehingga muda cri keperluan sehari” dkt jual mknn halal. Minus- 5 hr wifi ga berfungsi, pembatas kmr mandi ke kmr terlalu minim, sehingga air muda klr. Bgtu jg di pintu dpn. Tp semua oke pelayanan dan kebersihan jg mantul. Dng hrg segtu suda memuaskan buat sya."
