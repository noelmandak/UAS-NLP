"I was pleasantly surprised at how close this hotel was from the airport and how comfortable I felt on arrival. A great smile and welcome drink. Nice size rooms with balcony overlooking the view. A nice array choice for breakfast. Only 5 mins walk to the beach. I would stay here again, tomorrow"
"It's very close to the airport, and the hotel provides one-way airport transfer. The hotel looks nice and room is clean and spacious with balcony above the swimming pool. The staff are very friendly too. You can find some shops and warungs nearby, it's also a short car ride (Grab or Gojek) to the Tubah Beach where you can see sunset and have seafood (highly recommend Happy Gen). Good value of money for the location and service."
"If you need a transit hotel or a late arrival/ early departure place then it’s perfect. You can walk to Lippo Mall in 5 minutes . There’s a large supermarket there and various food outlets with variety and good prices, There is also a small restaurant at the reef hotel which had a decent menu. The pool is clean and the staff are lovely. Free airport drop off is provided also."
"Was first time in this hotel n I'm really loved.
It's very closed with airport which I can only a little walking to reach this hotel. The room was clean n complete for all I needed, the view direct to airport and the staff was very nice too. I would like to recommended to all who searching hotel near the airport. So easy to reach n so good hotel. Would like to come back here again when I come visiting Bali, perhaps next year again while every year I always come to Bali for vacation..  👍👍👍😍😍😍😍"
"We stayed there only one night but the service was amazing. They picked us up from the airport at 1am (included in the price) the room was super nice, with view on the pool, the bed super comfortable and the breakfast also super nice and abundant. I would definitely stay there again. The staff was super friendly even at 1am, they received us with a nice welcome drink too Thanks a lot Manggar."
"Good for near stay to airport. 
Free airport pickup or drop that is good.
Our flight is delayed 2 hrs and driver is waiting for us. Thank you so much for great services.
Good breakfast menu
Room is also clean and bed is comfortable"
"Beautiful cozy has that like 50’s era look &feel to it great location awesome staff quite nice breakfast excellent location close but not too close to airport,the best  laundry lady in Bali just down the street beaches,seggra Chinese Indonesian warung a walk away shopping,bars,water park close by just a great place to stay!!!"
"They provided great friendly communication, pick up/drop bac to airport at reasonable rate. Really handy if you stay temporarily in Bali to catch next flight domestic or int'l. If you dont hav baggage you can even walk from airport to Hotel Manggar. The pool is awesome respite and after long flight! Thanks Armi @Hotel Manggar for all the emails. Thanks all the staff who are so helpful and kind hearted. Best wishes John"
We had a nice evening at Manggar Indonesia Hotel. We arrived at the airport late at night so it was nice to get a free transfer to the hotel. The staff were great and the room was quiet and comfortable so we had a great night's sleep!
We really enjoyed staying at Manggar Indonesia. The breakfast was very nice. It’s also kind of cute and calm with a lot of plants and super clean. Very recommendable!
"The hotel is nice and the staff is super friendly and hospitable. I forgot my driving licence and the driver brought it to the airport, super appreciated!
They offer free transport to the airport. Close to the restaurants and the local quarter with lots of street food places. Recommended!"
"I needed to avoid greedy taxi drivers who offer a 20 dollars ride instead of having a 10 Minutes walk to the hotel. 
Nice spot to start further excursions over Bali. If you want to stay in Kuta: also just perfect."
"Location is 6 mins from the airport, has complimentary one-way shuttle service. Friendly staff. Room was decent and clean, but the toilet needs more maintenance. Aircon in some rooms not working. Great transient hotel as they charge per 8 hours, starting at the time of check-in."
The staff were great and went out of their way to help my wife who needed a pharmacy. Can’t speak highly enough of them.
"I didn't saw any cons for the place all were positive. Very near to Airport , Beach , Shops for the necessity items and restaurants to eat.
Staff were so courteous and helpful . Everything was so smooth from Check-in to checkout. 
At last a perfect place to stay in Bali either you are travelling solo or couple and family"
"Manggar Indonesia is an okay place to stay for solo traveller! The rooms, cleanliness, and service is good as expected from Bali"
I stop here at least  once every year as a transit point to further travels from Perth. It is walking distance to the airport.The staff are welcoming and easy. The rooms are Indonesian good. And they will take you back to the airport to save getting sweaty getting there.
Everything is fine except for the bathroom. The floor drain in the bathroom was not functioning. I ended up showering for only 1 minute because the water couldn’t flow down the drain
"We have stayed many times abd the management and staff are very understanding with travel changes and so cooperative , we find this hotel to be an oasis in Bali well positioned for all of our needs and great family feeling within the walks and within the staff"
"Strategically located near the airport,about 5 mins ... The airport pickup is very convenient,staffs are very friendly,the rooms are basic but clean!"
Stayed there for tow nights. You get more than what you pay for. the staff is friendly and accommodating.
"Stayed for one night during an airport transit. Great location, the airport pickup was perfect even though I only booked the hotel 2 hours in advance of my arrival time - I was impressed with their responsiveness! 
The restaurant and pool are beautiful spaces, and the breakfast is tasty (and they give you multiple options). The staff are wonderful, kind, understanding, and speak good English. 
The rooms themselves are simple and could use a bit of a spruce up to match the beauty of the common spaces, but worked perfectly fine. Bed was very comfortable, AC worked decently enough, shower had hot water, pool view from the balcony was definitely a plus. Hot water kettle and Nescafe in the room were a nice touch as well. WiFi didn't work for me while I was there, but the manager was gracious enough to let me use his hotspot when I really needed internet.
Would recommend for anyone with a short stay wanting to be close to the airport."
"The management and staff are so accomplished and accommodating, we have  been staying here over aong period of time and will be back again soon. I am repeating myself but it is a small oasis of sanity amongst a lot bad places in the Kuta, Tuban area. We will be back afain soon."
I have stayed here so many time and the reason for that is staff convinience and friendliness. From  gatdnerr to management
Simple guesthouse with a great location next to the airport. Complimentary air transfer - 1 way - us part of the room. Very convenient. Pleasant staff
"Best location, close to shops and local restaurants, close to airport, room is very clean, staff very friendly, totally recommend."
"I've stayed here on 3 occasions, and I've never been disappointed. I walked to the hotel using Google Maps, and got a free shuttle back for my departing flight. It's clean enough, the AC is cold, it's on a quiet back street but right in the middle of Kuta. The staff are friendly, the pool welcoming, the price unbeatable."
Affordable hotel near the airport. Airport pick-up or drop off available. Nice shaded pool.
"The location is very close to Bali airport, but the best part of this hotel is the service. We arrived at 0.30am and the driver already standby at the airport. We got a very affordable price with a very nice facility (this hotel has swimming pool)"
Highly recommend and value of money walking distance from airport its took 7min walk from airport to hotel nearest from indomart and other grocery
I’m so happy choosing this place mangar hotel in bali
"We had a late departing flight (10pm) but had to vacate our hotel room at midday.  So we organised a short day stay at Manggar.  Having a nice room, facilities, a good pool and a free transfer to the airport when needed, this hotel was perfect for passing the hours between our checkout and getting to the airport for our late flight.  All at an amazingly low price!!"
"The staff here were really friendly, the pool and rooms are clean and it is only a very short walk from the airport and to some restaurants and a supermarket while still being tucked away in a quiet laneway with no traffic.
Really good."
friendly staff. Good location for airport transit.
Great value hotel - comfortable balcony rooms and lovely garden and pool. Walking distance to airport - if you don't get lost! :-/
"10mins from airport, slightly older facility. but quiet area, good choice of meals, inhouse massage and pool...perfect for transit stay or longer term"
Its very near with the airport and the hotel give you free one-time shuttle from/to airport. Hotel is also clean and great. The staffs are all helpful. Worth the price!
Walking distance from airport. Good breakfast. Minimal mosquitoes despite reading at the balcony. Shower with hot water. Daily room cleaning if requested. Bathtub. Cold Aircon. Strong bidet flush. Balcony chairs and table. Recommended for long term stay as well as flight chasers.
"If you're in a short trip and you wanna stick around Kuta, this is  better place. You'll get a good place to chill and the staff will assist you in with any thing. They also offer you a free airport transfer."
Great place quite and great location airport shuttle and a very nice staff I will go back for sure
"It it the second time in a week but over the years we have stayed numerous times 1. Because of the position.
2  Because of the convenience to the, airport.
3.Most of all the staff and manegment make you so welcome.
4. I have sent so many friend to stay and they keep repeating.
5. We actually feel like family in this great Oasis amongst the other rubbish around Tuban and Kuta.
We will bee back and it will be this month again"
"The hotel is a less than 1 km from the airport and they also offer a free transfer from the airport to the hotel, so it is a perfect choice for those who are arrive late in Bali, we stayed for two nights and it was simply amazing"
We have stayed  on many accessions and find it to be a great hide away from the business around us
The hotel is near the airport and the rooms are clean. I love that there is a swimming pool here. Beach is also walking distance.
Free pickup from airport was nice bonus.
"As close to the Airport as you can get, with free transfers. If you leaving and need to catch early flight or arriving and feeling jet lagged then this is the place for you"
"We have stayed here regularly over the past many years . The management and staff cannot do enough to help you. The pool area is so nice and it is a secret paradise a block from stupidity of the rest of Bali..
We, are booking again to be back early next month..... Thank you Manggar."
Great location for transit . Good communication from staff and on email too. Great value for what you pay.
"Excellent hotel walking distance from airport and beach, down a quite lane. Cheap as chips."
"We stay here regularly and the staff and management are so helpful and  understanding a problem arises will be back afain soon, we have sent many people travelling to or from the ayirpirt to stay at MANGGAR.,, see you all soon again"
"Basic rooms, but great for the price.
The free airport pickup was great, driver didn't speak English but was waiting at the exit with our name on a paper.
This place is great for your first night when you arrive or last night before leaving the country,  but maybe not great for long term stay. 
Good for one night."
"Great value hotel tucked away in a quiet lane with easy access to taxis to all popular spots in Kuta. Fantastic staff offering a nice pool, basic breakfast and clean rooms. Stayed three times now and would stay again."
"The room is quite spacious and clean, the service of the staff is good and the pool is great. I suggest that they need more staffs to handle during high season so that they won't serve the breakfast too long. The taste of the dish is average, but complete."
It was awesome
To get to this hotel is quiet complicated sonce located in between the houses. But staying here is the best choice. Very beautiful hotel indoor. Breakfast is average. Staff is nice. Got welcome drink
"The hotel is very close to the airport, it is convenient for us to stay there as we arrived late and  had to leave early the next morning.
The free pick up service is a big plus. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.
We were able to take away our breakfast as we needed to leave before  the restaurant opens.
This is really value for money."
Overall worth experience.
Walking distance to airport and beach. Even closer to Lippo Mall and a good range of restaurants. Cosy design: every room has a small outdoor sitting area and is just a few steps from the pool.
"We've stayed at Manggar a few times now and for the price you pay it can't be beat. Very close to the airport, plenty of places to eat nearby, good staff and facilities, and quiet. We usually stay here for a few days at the start and end of our Indonesia trips and this is a good place to base yourself out of for places further afield in the country. We'll be back again."
Nearby Airport. Clean and good facilities
Convenient location in walking distance to the airport. Luckily you don't need to walk as they provide a free pick-up service. No noise from the airport though. No traffic noise as located in a small alleyway. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice pool. You have to remember though that this is a budget hotel. Not much maintenance has been done to the rooms and some other areas over the Covid period. Everything looks a bit tired. Let's hope they do some work as they are getting busier again after the pandemic.
We have stayed here numurious time we live in  North Bali so to us Mangga has become a home away from home. Very friendly and helpful staff.
"The positioning of this hotel suits, us being so close to the, airport and many shop an restaurants in the facinity. Staff are all friendly, they give you a welcome drink, pool area is just right and clean. Great place as a get away as we do frequently as we live in the North of Bali and this is where we also come for a break once a month... Next Time in Bali or in transit to or from the airport this is the place for you."
"Very near to airport. Included transport airport.
Very quiet and also close to beach, shops, restaurants.
Aswell cheap as touristic expensive Aere"
This is like a second home for me. I live in North Bali and do not need the Kuta /Legian area so this is my regular get away and we bring new friends all of the time... Closer to the airport that suits us and great staff.
"We have stayed 4 times in the last month with ourselves and friend, booked to be backfron overseas trip in 10 days because of the convenience"
"The hotel is close to the airport about 10 min taxi ride, I was exhausted and basically checked in and  crashed out. I did  enquire at checkin regarding a massage which was possible and very affordable. Breakfast was a buffet and very interesting. Free shuttle bus back to the airport next day. Staff all lovely!"
Nice clean rooms.
Dirty under the bed.  Exhaust fan above the toilet is covered with dust. Management should arrange the cleaning on routine basis. Pool clean and big enough to enjoy and get real exercise.  Motorbike parking big. Car parking not so much. Serene and green. Extend my stay thrice.
"Location is very close to the airport, you can even walk. On the other side it is in walking distance to a street with many restaurants and little shops. Perfect if you need to stay one night near the airport"
"We have stayed here on many occassions as it is near the airport although extremely quiet, friendly staff nice pool area. A welcome break for us from work in North Bali it is our escape a few times a month to cone down to a nice room and friendly faces."
Great place to stay near the airport. Cheap too.
"The staff is very nice, and I would especially recommend this stay for people who need/want to be close to the airport. I was satisfied! Thanks."
"Definitely worth the money, especially if you are just backpacking or transiting. Staffs are really helpful. They even waited for us in the airport even though we've been delayed for hours and hours already."
"Enjoyed  the stay at manggar hotel
Quiet location but still close enough to beach and eating places
Staff were excellent, helpful and very friendly
Very close to the airport, ideal for transit travellers
Thanks Manggar Hotel and staff"
"Location is good. Bathroom needs updated. Staffs are nice.
Thank you for everything."
Friendly staff. Didn’t understand what transient stay meant before we got there but it worked out fine for us.
"PROs:
- nice small back alley hotel with a small pool and restaurant area.
- rooms are clean with a small balcony
- staff are very nice
- possible to borrow hair dryer
- possible to request extra pillow
- walk about 3 mins and you can find restaurants / small stores / indomaret / massage place/ saloons
- MOST IMPORTANT IS FREE TRANSPORT TO AIRPORT! (1 way, and it only takes like 5-10 mins to reach)
CONs
its a small cosy hotel but not for the WEAK KNEE,
- we had to bring our luggage up/down 3 story to our room (NO LIFT AVAILABLE)
- we had to change our room because the AC was not working properly.. (they actually let us choose from another 3 rooms which was also not cooling enough, but well.. for this price..nothing to complain about)"
"We have stayed here on many occassions as it is, so quiet a bit of an oasis within a normally busy area, great staff, good size rooms and good pool area. We will be staying there again next month and again in June"
Only spent one night here but had a good experience and it was nice that they can arrange hotel pickup/drop off
"If you are taking a midnight flight or you’re making a transfer-to or from the airport, Manggar Hotel is definitely a great choice. It also has a one way pick up and drop off service. Nice breakfast, room was great, can rent their scoopy and ride around Kuta!"
"What can I say,if you don’t stay there you are missin out"
"We were only here for 8 hours after having a flight delayed and arriving at 4am but staff were great, beds were comfy and there was a free transport back to the airport."
"Needed a Hotel close to airport due to arriving at !am on the Sat morn. What a find, airport pick up and breakfast included in our extremely incredible price. Staff were excellent from pick up to leaving. Breakfast hit the spot, some good choices and cooked well. Could not recommend this Hotel more highly. Thank you all. Regards Garry &Terri"
"Very basic hotel within walking distance of the airport, even with a suitcase, and then ideal for access to Kuta. The rooms are not luxurious, but we would use it again for a short stay"
"Lokasi strategis, meskipun rada masuk gang so far bisalah kesini lagi :)"
"Wonderful warm staff, clean rooms though a little small unless you are alone, beautiful pool. I found the breakfast so so, even the Indonesian one. Great buy if you need to be close to the airport"
"We stayed here a couple nights when we arrived in Bali, and now we stayed here before leaving. It’s super close to the airport. Facilities are pretty basic but adequate for a short stay. Easy walking distance to a few restaurants and even the beach. Could be cleaner. There’s a fair amount of noise in the mornings - a mosque, roosters, and then a school at about 8am will make sure you get an early start to the day."
"Flew in late so decided to stay near the airport for a night 
Staff were so very friendly and helpful and the actual room while plain and simple it was comfortable."
Very friendly and helpful staffs
"It is, a place I have stayed numerous times even through the pandemic  it fill all my needs, staff and management  are evcellent."
"I have stayed here twice already this month and will be staying another to times on my way to Vietnam and on my return, it suits our family because location  we, are friendly with all of the staff and it is preferred place to stay when we are down south, good pool area good staff and exceptional security..... We look forward to our stay this coming week."
"Very helpful and friendly staffs,"
Perfect location
Decided on different hotel to stay.
"This hotel is very near the airport. It has a pool, food and palm trees! We found it relaxing and a great place from which to explore the area. I would stay here again."
"It is located In a nice quiet area and is convenient to all the facilities, we require, we live in North Bali and whenever we have, a week end off or we, travel by plane, elsewhere we stay here. Very good, friendly staff, good security, great pool area we, will be back"
"Room is basic.  Tapware for basin and shower are really dirty from corrosion/hard water and detract from the room completely.  Room service food was good.  Breakfast was as basic as you get from cheaper hotels, although the coffee is terrible."
"Highly recommended for u who looking for hotel nearby the airport. Clean, great breakfast, helpful staffs."
Great location.  Friendly staff.  Easy access to and from the airport.  I'd return in the future.
"Fellow Travelers, this is what you want."
"We stay here frequently as it suits us in the position it is, by staying here we are close to what we like staff very good service excellent and also close to a local super market and many surrounding restaurants... We booked for more time this month."
"Great place to stay! right next to the airport with a free shuttle service, perfect for when you need to get to the airport early morning. 
Just a 20 min walk takes you into Kuta, or grab a taxi/ grab."
"I have stayed here on many occassions staff are great good service from thee moment you arrive, very nice pool area, good breakfast and airport transport."
Overall is satisfied. just bathroom cleanliness need to improved. Highly recommended for transit staying.
"Front staff know how to do when there s no bell boy to bring my bag to the room, he did a good job  he help us to carried our bag to the room. N they were friendly n polite. She also reminded us abt our welcome drinks bcuse we were so hurry heheheh. Thanks. Good job."
"Good and recommended place hotel to stay in kuta, especially to catch up flight. the hotel is 5 min from the airport."
This is a good budget hotel. It is good value for what you pay. Staff are very friendly. I have stayed on two seperate occasions. Both times the showers are very slow to drain.  There are a range of eating options near by within walking distance. Reccommend for proximity to airport.
Good value for money
"Good room , great internet , near the airport , they provide free transportation to the airport , the only thing was that there was no hot water"
"Had a long transit in Bali (12 hours). Booked the day room to go get some sleep and shower before catching flight again. VERY CLOSE, walking distance if you dont have a lot of luggage. Arrived earlier than check in time, but they were kind enough to let us leave our backpacks and chill by the pool with welcome drinks. Alternatively, you can catch a taxi / cab. It was 130,000 RP. They offered free one way pick up / drop off. (Chose to get dropped off for free). Staff were very kind and accomodating. Rooms are big enough, simple amenities supplied. It wasn’t the cleanest bathroom, but good enough to get the job done esp for a day room. 
Travellers Tip (if transit / using day room) - As soon as we arrived, we went back in through security and stored our bags for 70,000 RP each at the luggage shop. You can exit security again and come back in time for Check In."
Wonderful easy to get to hotel. I will be back.
"I have stayed here 3 times this month already and will be staying on my return from Vietnam late next week, so convenient and yet out of the rubbish traffic and noises of many of the other hotels in the, area"
"The hotel is very close to the airport. You can just walk from the airport. The staff is nice. However, the food still need improvement. Better stay without breakfast here"
Booked for my transit to take a shower and a nap. Reasonable price
"Very close to Airport, great prices with very helpful and friendly staff. It is my second stay and will definitely use this hotel again."
Perfect for a late flight or quick stop
The location is not the best but still managed. Staff is friendly and place is clean.
We have stayed here 4 times in the last month very convinient to airport and great eating area.
Nice hotel and staff. Lovely pool. Comfy beds and air con. A bit tricky to find
