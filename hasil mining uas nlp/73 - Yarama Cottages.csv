Column 1
"If you like Yoga Barn, this is the place for you! Just 2mins away. The place is quite even if the entrance is on the main road.
The room is spacious and clean. The staff came everyday to clean and tidy up the room.
The position is quite central and if you want to move there is plenty of gojek. I will be back."
"Literally best price with best location and best facilities. Located in the heart of Ubud, the rooms are very clean, with good designs and full of natural lighting in which very important for me. Absolutely love staying in this cottage. Will definitely recommend to everyone I know for a stay in Ubud. Thank you so much for the very pleasant stay!!"
"I love my stay at YARAMA COTTAGE, when I  leave I know I will comeback here with longer stay. 
The kitchenette is complete, the bed also comfy. The bathroom is perfectly clean and this one wow me coz you can choose what kind of shower do you prefer, the had 3 types :)
The staff also friendly, they clean the room every day even just for short stay.
Personally I like the room design with high ceiling and simple design."
"Great value for money. Central location surrounded by all you need. 2 min walk from supermarket. Plenty of great restaurants, massage places. Walking distance to monkey forest. 
If you’re visiting The Yoga Barn, you couldn’t get much closer without actually staying on site.
Friendly helpful staff. Very clean and spacious rooms with lots of storage and a huge comfortable bed. Air conditioning, hot water, kettle and fridge. Great simple breakfast of eggs any way, fruit and hot drinks included. 
This is the second time I stay here and I would stay again."
"The location is amazing, the street is full with amazing restaurants and few minutes away from the monkey forest, the staff were helpful and the room was clean 👍🏼"
"I booked for 3 nights, extended for 6 more nights, and stayed in 2 different rooms (same type). The location is excellent on the main street of Hanoman (the intersection), a very short walk from Coco Mart, ATMs, pharmacies, Monkey Forest, Yoga Barn, and many cafes, spas, etc. The property is tucked in an alley. If you take the room with the kitchen which is further from the main street, you can't hear the street noise. The room is spacious (enough to do yoga with a mat) with a homey interior. The kitchen is great with proper utensils. The wifi and hot shower all worked, but with different quality depending on which room you get. The working desk is a bonus. The small garden is pretty and sets up the whole mood. Cleanliness is OK but could be better (a bit of dust on the nightstands). Room amenities were a little inconsistent (kitchen scissors in one, and not in the other; hand/body soap in one, and not in the other; wifi password notes in one, and not in the other). The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms with a kitchen are the best value. They're quickly sold out. All in all very recommended for a short or a long stay."
The best economy hotel with simply and style design near the very Ubud center.  My favorite cottages contain kitchen and have a big windows to the garden. And the hostess team always very kindly and helpful.
"It's my second time there. And I love it. The hospitality, the cleanliness, the ambience. Love it. Definitely worth the price."
Our stay was too short! I wish we could stay longer in Yarama! Every staff were very friendly and the room was very clean! We will definitely come back again!
"This is right next door to the back entrance of yoga barn so very easy if you are taking lots of classes, especially early or late ones! 
They even had a mini fridge which was very convenient. Also drawers to unpack in/get settled.  Incredible value for the money $285k/night, including aircon"
We had a very cozy stay at yarama cottages. We loved the interieur and also the little garden in front of the cottage. It‘s a little calm oasis directly in ubud. So you have everything you need in walking distance.
"Felt very good there.. simple room, although comfortable. Loved the breakfast every day and a highlight for me were the staff. All of them so friendly and accommodating. They made it for me :-)"
Great option if you plan on doing lots of yoga barn clases as it’s right next to the back entrance. My room had ac and a mini fridge and lots of space- the ac rooms are also well off the street so very quiet.
price is affordable. many popular location near this place so its easier to go everywhere. but I think the parking area need to be inside not outside so it is more safe.
"Very convenient for food.
The location is good and the staffs are friendly"
"I was staying at Grand deluxe suite on Oct 21 which is worth it. I was wfh and sfh while enjoying my stay there, its a well maintained property. My sister and I can get all need within walking distance i.e convenience store, atm, foods, cafes etc"
The room is simple and cozy. Bed and pillow is super comfortable and staff are very helpful. Simple breakfast but they are delicious.
"Yarama Cottages have very friendly staff, have a beautiful green garden in front of the cottages, and are ideally location to explore Ubud."
I have stayed here 3x this year and definitely will come back for more next year.
"Everything was top,
From location to friendly staff.
Only thing to bear in mind is that you need to bring your own toilet tissue and 
Basic toiletries as they don’t provide.
Will not hesitate to stay again if returning to Ubud.
Highly recommended."
I like a location and room. Lovely room and friendly staff very safety for lady solo travel close for every where :)
I personally think its nice. Comes with everything you need except shampoo and soap :)
"It's in a central location so you'll can walk around Ubud very easily. We explored the city by foot and this was a convenient base.
It's also next door to yogabarn so this is a cheaper alternative if you're coming here for a yoga holiday.
Staff was nice and responsive.  We used their laundry pick-up and delivery service. It was very quick and convenient."
"I had a nice stay in Yarama : the room was nice, the staff really caring! Just pay attention that some rooms are not up on the website. I first arrived in a room that was quite dirty, paiting was going off, very noisy with the road nearby, but with discussion with the staff I managed to change rooms and have a other one that was quite good :) ... if you can, try to visit the place beforehand!"
"Next akan kesini lagi, recommended pokoknya!"
"Location 5/5
Stay 5/5
Staff 5/5 very cooperative 
Rooms 5/5
Breakfast quantity was not satisfying 2/5
Overall I would come again to stay here"
Just next door to Yogabarn
"All is very well! Cleanliness, Service, Place and Ambiance almost perfect!"
"Amazing little hotel situated smack in the middle of ubud area. Amazing location with a team of amazing staff, however cleanliness can be improved.
Little cobwebs can be found in certain areas of the room high ceiling. But all in all, an amazing little hotel."
"Perfect location in the central Ubud, walking distance to all the essentials. Room is spacious with a proper kitchenette and utensils. Balcony was great looking to the garden. The hot tub was a bonus. Bed quality was great. Good place for long term stay."
Wonderful moment i had stay in the cottage 😘
"Good accommodation in the middle of Ubud but on a silent path away from the main street. The staff is very friendly and helpful and always fast to respond to our needs through WhatsApp. The location is very good as it is close to good restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, main sightseeing areas, etc. In the deluxe suite we have made good use of the kitchen (specifically for this room) and the porch which are nice facilities."
"Staff were very friendly. Near to so many eateries. Near to Ubud monkey forest, palace and market. Value for money."
Great place
We stayed in one of two older-looking rooms than the other rooms. It was OK for the price we paid. Room service was excellent.
I went to Yoga Barn literally every day for 3 days & Yarama was located next door. So it’s such a perfect & nice spot for me. It’s also next to Pison & lots of other restaurants so very very strategic place. The bathroom condition & cleanliness is ok - got stains here & there but overall is ok given that the price is very affordable. I would definitely stay there again next time I come to Ubud.
Clean comfortabel and perfect location in Ubud and next to Yoga barn for the modern yogi.
Clean and convenient.
"Nice room and private, each person got their own cottage and its in the central ubud!"
"Very strategic location, you can go to Seeds/Mamma Mia/Monkey Forest just by walk. Clean, very helpfull staff, very big room."
"First of all you have to be very aware on which type of room that you’re choosing, since they have the Standard & Deluxe rooms; which each of them have different vibe & looks.
I stayed in the Standard room which very much ticking the basic room necessities & at par with the price paid. Feels somewhat old, however all the items are clean and works perfectly (it has working aircon, hot water, fridge, water kettle & wifi).
Not forgetting to mention the location that is super strategic! In the heart of Ubud and a walking distance from many restos, minimart, drugstore & even massage place."
"good place to stay,many cafe’s nearby…recommended for those travellers want convenience…"
this was the absolute perfect location in Ubud. Perfectly situated in the heart of Ubud - about 3 min walk from the Sacred Monkey Forest and there is a lot of nice restaurants and bars nearby.
Yarama is the best option if u wanna stay with ur family or friends. Will be back again.
"Harganya sepadan dengan kualitasnya
Tempatnya bersih, dapur lengkap, best"
"The size of the room is big enough for long time stay. I even can drawing/paint here. :) There's a kitchen also to cook simple dishes or for breakfast, but you can find any food around cottage with valuable price. Recommended !!"
"Did long 4n stay here and they got quite lot option if u re on budget. Location really near to monkey forest, pison coffee and i even did my antigen test walking on supermarket nearby. The only minus thing is the building is quite old so it got yellow stain in bathroom but it really minor."
"The cottage is located right in the middle of Ubud, easy to roam around. The room big but very basic however it’s comfortable enough for the price. Breakfast also very basic but acceptable. The staffs are very nice and very helpful. They’re trying their best to make the guests feel comfortable. Will definitely come back"
staff was super friendly and the breakfast was good too!
"But please the staff for morning don't wake up guests for breakfast, if the guests haven't ordered breakfast. Very annoying in the morning knocking on the door repeatedly. Female staff. Very annoying in the morning knocking on the door repeatedly. Female staff. Overall ALL GOOD. Definitely come back here 💚"
"In the heart of Ubud, everything within easy walking distance, this is a great place to stay for a reasonable price. The shower was excellent, well needed in the hot environment. The Internet connection was good. The room got cleaned daily. I stayed for 10 days and was very happy overall."
the places is near from everywhere and very clean
"Great location, really close to everything. Cool interior. Great value for money."
"Monkey forest, Yoga Barn, restaurants, etc are very accessible. Bathroom was a bit of a disappointment but room was spacious and comfortable."
"Location is good, hard to park motorbike, but overall was good. We asked for an extra bed on the last day, but the staff said the bed is too huge to carry upstairs. Clearly he was lazy to pick up the bed, so our friend had to find another place. They also said its full house, but they were no one at the room below us. So a bit disappointed.
Breakfast was small, better get it from across the road. No need to pay extra for breakfast"
"I love this place. It is located in the center of Ubud and very easy to access restaurant or cafe. 
The room was big enough"
"the staff was so friendly and courteous! breakfast was delicious and the room was quite clean and bug-free. they picked me up from the airport which was so nice. nothing super fancy, but great if you don’t need anything super luxurious."
"When I arrived I was a bit disappointed, it looked abandoned and eerie from the exterior at night. But The suite that I booked was a release, it's similar to the photo in site and very comfortable, just step away from Yoga Barn and my fav cafes and restaurant. It's worth every penny"
"next to yoga barn is a plus, I stayed in one of the older rooms at the front and after the first day I settled in. The price is hard to beat, and overall it was good for 5 days."
I bring a car from bandung to bali and there is no parking lot only for 2 car. The cottage is ok and great下次再来
"All good except amenities, no bath kit, mineral water, coffee/tea"
Clean and comfortable 👍
"Locatio was perfect!
Condition of room was great!
Quiet big for solo traveller
Reception was bit poorly arranged
But staff are so kind and nice
I'll really stay again when I come back to Bali!
So reasonable price and private area was nice! 
Thanks guys"
"Some of the reviews I read were pretty harsh which made me a little worried in the beginning, however I don't think it's fair to expect and demand too much from this accomodation, given that the price was super cheap - what you pay is what you get. If you are meaning to spend most of your time relaxing in instead of venturing out, I recommend you booking a resort instead.
I stayed here for two nights with my partner, we were local tourists. We booked the grand deluxe suite (most recommended, others options looked pretty old). The location was super strategic, you'll have plenty of options to dine out. There were also lots of shops/mini markets around, and food stands in the morning so I don't think ordering breakfast from the hotel is necessary. It's also walking distance to monkey forest and the yoga barn.
The room was standard and clean 'enough', not too new, not too worn out.  The kitchen set was very useful, however with limited utensils. The bathroom was fine. We weren't given any toiletries so keep in mind to bring your own. The water that flows through the bathtub did have a smell to it, however the water in the shower was perfectly fine. The garden was quite nice and lush. 
There was only one major problem that occurred during our stay. The instant we walked into our room, the AC was leaking. The staff however called up the mechanic right away and the AC was repaired within 1.5 hours. 
We brought our own car and we were lucky that no other guests brought any other vehicle, as there is only space for one big car or 2 small cars to park. The staff were friendly, however you can tell they aren't professionally trained or qualified, so don't expect world class service, but they will help you IF you call out for them. 
Other than that, we weren't really fussed about any other thing. We really enjoyed our stay here, I would recommend this place if you're on a budget."
"Price: affordable. Basic facilities. Love the bathtub with strong quick hot water.
Location: on the main road. The place is actually quiet, doesnt have noise from outside. Great if you want to be central but dislike the hustle.
Staff: lovely, always smiling
Free breakfast: not many options, but they serve it in the coffee table in front of your room.
Room is SPACIOUS. great if you have a yoga mat or big luggages.
What can be improved:
Sound-proof: I can hear well other people in the next room, and from outside.
Facilities: 
- there weren't many things in the room, but for a budget I think it's alright. Would love to have more than 1 towel to be honest. 
- The bathtub is big, which limits to washing bowl to a tiny space.
- old fridge made such a big noise that I unplug it every night to sleep.
- the bathroom has only 1 drain, bathtub didnt have any curtain, so water splashed and the whole floor was wet.
- the bed sheets should look cleaner. They look old and a bit smelly."
"Good place , near to market , in gallery there are mosquito need to work on it
Who are willing to explore ubud with budget traveling and with good rooms go for it"
"If you’re looking for yoga class in yoga barn, and on budget, this is perfect for you! You just need to walk to yoga barn!"
Great option if you want to be centrally located and walking distance to restaurants and attractions. Staff were helpful and believe the accomodation provided value for money
"overall good, clean and spacious room with shower , bathup , and kitchen. worth the price."
"The location is nearest with everything such as cafés, restaurants, the sacred monkey forest. The staffs were also helpful and polite by their hospitality. The breakfast was meh. The portion was too small. I should eat twice at the nearby restaurant. Overall the location has won my heart."
"I booked suite garden room for four days and it was a great stay. Aside the prime location, the room was spacious and very comfy. However i booked the room with breakfast, but during my four days staying there I only get twice breakfast. Next time it's better order the room without breakfast. Amenities were super minimal and some you need to ask, even bottled water. No phone line in the room so you need to find the staff to get what you want. I bought my own amenities to avoid the inconvenience. Other than that it was great."
"I liked staying at Yarama. The room was clean & had everything I needed & there were a good selection of cafes, shops & restaurants nearby. Right next door to the yoga barn."
"If you get the standard room, it's just a simple guesthouse. The pictures are a bit deceiving but overall it did the job and was a nice, clean place to stay for the weekend."
"We got the cottage's information from Agoda. The facility is located at Ubud center. From here is quite easy to reach the spots. Unfortunately, there are only 3 places for guests, those are really not enough for 18 rooms they have, especially at holiday season"
Pretty much affordable for the whole facilities. A little bit spider web and dust on some places. The breakfast is delicious! I stayed 2 nights at Suite Deluxe room and it’s worth the price.
Best location at this price
We had a small problem with the room. The owner as well as the staff were very helpful in finding a solution.
"We stayed in the standard room and thought we had upgraded to the deluxe garden suite. When we arrived their were ants all over the floor in the room and there was even a gecko crawling in and out of our door. The staff were extremely pleasant, and tried to be accommodating as possible! Breakfast was pretty solid and the location was close to the heart of Ubud! All in all, don’t go for the standard room and try to upgrade to the deluxe suites if possible! Also in house laundry was done in 12 hours and smelt fresh!"
"i interrested to this cottage because they look cozy and homy in pictures. yet the staffs and the owner need to pay attention to the cleanliness, for example the pillow case and blankets are kinda stinky and seemed not to be replaced from previous guest. They don’t provide bottle of mineral water, soap, shampoo and tissue."
"The place so strategic, in the center of Ubud.  and so convenient for people who want to chill and staycation.
Suggestion only for the detail matter like kettle need more clean as well as the towel.
Overall was a good experience staying here."
"From the condition of the wall and furniture, it's pretty easy to say this accommodation needs some attempt to rejuvenate. The wifi isn't the fastest, and the breakfast is pretty light (it's more like a snack instead of breakfast)."
parking area so bad
"This is a newly opened property and is trying to catch up with the others, which it will very soon. The staff seemed to be new in the business. 
The included breakfast includes either omlette/banana pancake(any one), fresh fruits in small quantity along with tea/coffee. 
You get drinking water bottles for the first day and then you have to ask for refill which   is done quickly. There was no soap offered in the bathroom only handwash was available. 
It has a kitchen, so you can cook your own food but the condiments you need to buy from the shopping mall which is 300m from the place. 
It has many good cafes and restaurants within 200m and is located in a great area. 
Only 1.6km from the ubud market. 
Overall the property and its rooms are comfy and beautiful. All they need to work upon is the amenities"
"I stayed in Yarama Cottage for a week. The room is okay, location is good, staff are kind, but the service is bad. 
1. They have a laundry service by charging, and I had some laundry. My white T-shirts got orange colored because they just put all the laundry together. Even though doing light color laundry separately is a basic, they didn't do it. I noticed this after checking out and I should throw my shirt away.
2. The cleaning team always miss something. One day, they didn't change the towel. One day, they didn't change tissue even though I put the empty tissue box on the bed. One day, they didn't add toilet paper. Although everyday I put some tips on the bed, they always missed something.
Like I said so, the location is good, the room is okay, however, they need to train the staff more. Ruining my clothes was unforgivable."
"My first night was horrible, bed sheet was dusty and pillow smell bad. The next morning I ask homestay staff to change the sheet & pillow and my stay became way better.
Staff was great. Breakfast do not expect anything. Location great. Facility can be maintained better."
"I stayed in standard room for 2 days
+pros
Location - easy acess to convinience store, other supermarket, monkey forest, yoga barn and one of the main street
Price - decent price
-cons
They can def use some new pillows. Smells like sweat."
"Friendly staff, cleanliness can be improved"
I liked the place. but please...  ants are literally everywhere.
"Quiet place, close to restaurants and you can walk easily around. No tea or coffee supplied, take your own or by from local Coco supermarket"
"Everything else is good, just that they have no facilities."
"The location of the hotel is perfect, all the nice restaurants are within walking distance, and the supermarket is also nearby. The room itself was not bad, but due to high humidity the pillows smelled awful, I slept without one. Do not take breakfast, it's worthless: 2 little pancakes and very sweet tea, better to have a nice breakfast in the nearby cafe. If you want to save your money this place can be an option"
"A few hours before check in,I call the hotel asking wether they have parking slot or not,the girl who pick up the phone seems like didn't have manner how to pick up the phone nicely.Check in around 5pm and all the way to hotel was pouring rain, plan will take shower directly after check in.The room was clean when I arrive unfortunately there's no towels,tissue and toilet paper in the room.Need to up  and down the stairs twice begging for towels and after 4 hours  waiting finally the staff bring towels.I hope the manager will train the staff how to treat guests without  
discrimination for what guests nationality and train the staff how to pick up phone nicely as profesional as others Hotel's staff.These days Bali still counting on Local guests,so please treat us as same as other nationality.Local also tipping ,as what I did to the front office staff and I leave money too for the room attendant without leaving much mess in the room."
"Good location. Very clean. Modern design. The negatives were mainly noise-related. Staff from either Yarama or the property next door tend to gather for conversations around the back of the rooms, which results in a lot of noise directly entering the room through the bathroom. Contrary to other reviews, I didn’t notice any noise from the yogis visiting Yoga Barn next door - it was mainly the staff."
"We enjoyed our stay because of the modern design and the good location - not far from restaurants, supermarkets, temples, waterfalls, city etc.
The staff is really friendly and the rooms in the back (deluxe rooms) are quiet.
Unfortunately it wasn't clean at all in some areas like the bathroom or the stove even though you can easily wipe the dirt of."
No Morning Coffee & Tea. Broken Lamp but the staff do nothing except apologize. Quite close to the center and that's it
what you pay is what you get.
"I book 2 nights to stay in this hotel.. they not even provide us mineral water, i asked the staff, and they said the water is finished and they haven,t buy any extra yet and they not even try to buy some from the supermarket.. the last day, i asked the staff again about the mineral water and i complain about this, after that they just give what i ask"
"Yarama is near to the central but the thing is…somehow there’s no hot water, the water pressure of the shower really bad, the lighting not so good"
"Nicely located in Ubud, very strategic. Very poor operating standard made it unbearable."
"Very ok type. I saw 3 stars and booked, but no amenities."
Over all. As usual plumping weak. No car park  poor breakfast
"I stayed here twice. First time in suit and it was nice, second time I was in the room. I gotta a say that it wasn't cleaned properly... I found a condom wrap in my drawer, the place had a strange smell, once I got a towel that stank. I will definately not be back here..."
"I had to leave after 10 hours. It was just too budget for me. There were hair in my room both in the bathroom and in the bed. The sheets and room smelled and there were bug everywhere. 
There was no soap and they also started cleaning and sweeping outside before 6am. I would not stay there again."
"nothing you canexpect , cheap
bed okay aircon okay"
"Our room smelled weird and was not very clean. There were a leak on the bathtub and the bathroom quickly became flooded. But we were staying only for one night, so it was ok and fitted the cheap price we paid."
"Just make sure when you book the room you will check for the suite as my friends made that mistake and the room was horrible. Smelt like mould. The modern room is a lot nicer but it still had a mould smell. Staff didn't speak English and they didn't even change my sheets from the last guest. So there was someone else hair on my pillow case and when I went to ask them to change to fresh clean sheets as most hotels would do that with new guest coming to check in. They said all sheets were at the laundry and couldn't have clean ones. The breakfast was horrible. And they didn't wait til you ask for it. At 7:30am they came knocked on the door and left breakfast on the table outside so if you aren't awake the ants will eat it. or it would just be cold. They don't even give you a choice of anything. One day was an under cooked pancake. Next day was an over cooked salty Omelette and coffee full of sugar!!! They need to understand what customer service is in hospitality. The modern room is nice but the other rooms a shit hole! so they need to knock it down or refurbish the place. 
NOTE TO OWNER!! CHANGE THE SHEETS WITH NEW GUEST! this is a joke"
I would not recommend this place if you are a female traveller as there feels like safety would be an issue. Plus the sheets were dirty.
"saya pesen 2 kamar dengan tipe sama, tapi yang di kasih kamarnya 1 bagus 1 lagi parah banget, gak sesuai. di kasurnya banyak tunggau, tanggan kaki saya digigit. I booked 2 rooms, same types. But I got different, one is good and another really bad. so many mites in the bed"
"I don’t write reviews ever.. but unfortunately the room/unit is not what is shown in the marketing/and photos of the space. A/C unit barely worked, walls haven’t been painted in easily 10+ years, along with mold smell and what appeared to be mold above shower head in right hand corner. Did not stay the first night, and moved to another hotel."
"the room was very dark..no sunlight like the photoes.
staffs are looks sooooo dark when i arrived.
never clean my room during 3nights, no new  towels and toilet paper.i had to ask them. 
i booked room with kitchen but....
didn't want to cook anything in there.
water .... super smelly......
i wanted to move.. was bad experience in ubud.. i cannot understand why this accommodation has good rating.."
"1. So many insects and small animals in the room
2. The plumbing might be clogged a bit because water can't seem to go down the drain quickly
3. Hot water comes very slowly at the afternoon
4. The water smells like iron or rust
5. There are faint scent of dampness in the room
6. Mobile Phone Signals can't reach the area, it's blank spot here
7. The Wi-Fi is there but might as well not because there's always no internet
8. Only 2 car parking slot and one will block the other. you need to give your key to the management bute none of them can drive so they will knock on your door and ask you to move the car anyway when the other guest want to go out
9. There's a small alley next to the hotel so depends on the traffic, sometimes you will hear motorcycle and people talking from your room
10. And I was about to withold all these complaints if not for what happened which i will explain below:
the management doesn't understand hospitality at all.
i booked grand deluxe suite and was put on the deluxe suite instead because the room i already booked was sold to someone else. i complained and at first the management seemed professional enough and very kindly offered to fully refund what i paid and still give me free stay at the available room.
i was impressed and intend to give back half of what i was refunded as a tip, but then the staffs came back and keep pestering me about the free stay, asking if i got find another hotel to stay with the refunded money.
this is very unprofessional made us very uncomfortable in our stay. i asked them if they want me out or want me to return the refunded money, but in doing so that would mean that they get back at their own words.
i was ready to give a generous tip, write a 5 stars review and i even already recommend this to my family for our december vacation, but it's out of the question now.
i would rather use the money I had to book this hotel again from another account or another platform just to leave negative review on it.
If y"
It's not a nice place to stay
I booked a deluxe room and after my payment. They gave me stander room. Not clean and very very old and so many ants around the room
"I really loved my stay at Yarama Cottages.  There are about 6 rooms in total, which makes this place more of a boutique opportunity with personalised service from the beautiful Balinese staff.  They are quiet and private, ensuring your personal space is not breached. Yet, they are also very attentive and will come running at the first sign of a guest's stretched neck looking for assistance.  They offered me a universal charger immediately, and also when my aunt came to visit and requested an extra towel (to lay on the floor as a bath mat), they must have taken note as each day we received a spare towel neatly placed on the floor so we only had to ask for it once.  The only downside to this place is that Siam Sally's is next door, which means the live band makes it hard to have a peaceful sleep if you want to tuck in early.  Other than that, Yarama Cottages is perfectly located next to The Yoga Barn, and is easy to find after a day out exploring.  This is my favourite part of Ubud. Definitely coming back."
"I stayed almost 3 weeks in this lovely room.
First 1 week we had stayed once, then decided to a week more. My sister and i went to Gili Air with very cheap fare, thanks to the Yarama staff's kindly helps. Then back to Ubud stayed few more days in the same room. When the room was not avilable due to other's reservation, we missed this room pretty much. :)
Hot water, huge and clean bed, kind staff, very good location from Yoga Barn, many restaurants, quiet and convenient 
Should be there once, you will see"
"The place is situated in the best possible spot, 5 min walk to the Monkey Forest, lots of restaurants and shops around. Yarama is also neigbourhood of the famous Yoga Barn. Room is comfy, cleaned every day with good bed, air con and terrace. They have simple breakfast but good pancakes and omlettes which is brought to your room every morning. You may also rent a bike at place. The only problem is the water pressure and mixing - you have either very low pressure of cold or better pressure hot as hell. The staff is nice and helpful however English might be better. Altogether good four days spent at Yarama :-)"
"Excellent, good value accommodation in Ubud. Just a few minutes walk to: Hubud entrepreneur hub, huge Coco grocery store, restaurants, Monkey Forest, boutique shopping.. I really like this part of town, and I would stay here again! The staff are very friendly, relaxed and helpful. The pancake breakfast is excellent and will keep you full all morning! Only issue I had was the wifi Internet was a bit unreliable, but this is not uncommon in many accommodation options in Bali, and the room nearest the street had some street and music noise, but the room is priced accordingly and is excellent value (the rooms further in from the street are much quieter but a little more pricey.) Overall this place is excellent value! TIP: The hotel next door will let you use their swimming pool facilities all day for a very reasonable price! So if you're hot you can walk next door and be lazy by the pool :) Thank you for having me stay at your hotel in Ubud village!"
"I stayed at Yarama for a week and felt very at home. It had everything you need for a comfortable stay - a refrigerator, kettle and air conditioning. 
The room was spacious, I was able to practice yoga easily. It was modern and clean and had a nice feel. 
The bed was huge and a good standard. 
The staff are lovely, very helpful and attentive. As a female travelling alone I felt very safe here. 
If you’re planning to take classes at The Yoga Barn, this is the perfect place to stay - you can roll out of bed and straight there. 
Breakfast was good quality, and brought to your personal terrace at the time of your choice. 
I would stay here again."
"I stayed in Yarama Cottages twice in a week transiting via Ubud. My first room was good but there was a mouldy smell somehow.
My second stay was ok, no tv in the room ans ended up with bed bugs bites.
despite that this is a lovely place, nice staff, close to the yoga barn, 5mn walk to the monkey forest and the yummy breakfast is served on your personal terrasse."
"My partner and I stayed at Yarama for 10 nights and we wish we could have stayed longer. The staff working there are all amazing- so friendly and helpful! The wifi is good, the location is perfect, the room is a decent size and gets cleaned every day. The breakfast is tasty (fruit, coffee and banana pancake or toast and eggs). Its also a 1 min walk to Yoga Barn- so for yogis it's ideal. I highly recommend staying here!"
